                                 PREFACE.



The letters of Horace Walpole, Earl of Orford, as hitherto
published, have consisted of,-

1. The letters contained in the quarto edition of his works,
published in the year 1798.

2. His letters to George Montagu, Esq. from 1738 to 1770,
which formed one quarto volume, published in 1818.

3. His letters to the Rev.  William Cole and others, from 1745
to 1782, published in the same form and year.

4. His letters to the Earl of Hertford, during his lordship's
embassy to Paris, and also to the Rev.  Henry Zouch, which
appeared in quarto, in 1825.

And 5. His letters to Sir Horace Mann, British Envoy at the Court
of Tuscany, from 1741 to 1760, first published in 1833, in three
volumes octavo, from the originals in the possession of the Earl
of Waldegrave; edited by Lord Dover, with an original memoir of
the author.

To the above are now added several hundred letters, which have
hitherto existed Only in manuscript, or made their appearance
singly and incidentally in other works.  In this new
collection, besides the letters to Miss Berry, are some to the
Hon.  H. S. Conway, and John Chute, Esq. omitted In former
editions; and many to Lady Suffolk, his brother-in-law,
Charles Churchill, Esq., Captain Jephson, Sir David Dalrymple,
Lord Hailes, the Earl of Buchan, the Earl of Charlemont, Mr.
Gibbon, Mr. Pitt, afterwards Earl of Chatham, George Hardinge,
Esq., Mr. Pinkerton, and other distinguished characters.  The
letters to the Rev. William Cole have been carefully examined
with the originals, and many explanatory notes added, from the
manuscript collections of that indefatigable antiquary,
deposited in the British museum.

Besides being the only complete edition ever published of the
incomparable letters of this "prince of epistolary writers,"
as he has been designated by an eminent critic, the present
work possesses the further advantage of exhibiting the letters
themselves in chronological order.  Thus the whole series
forms a lively and most interesting commentary on the events
of the age, as well as a record of the most important
transactions, invaluable to the historian and politician, from
1735 to 1797-a period of more than sixty years.

To Lord Dover's description of these letters (1) little need
be added.  Of Horace Walpole it is not too much to say, that
he knew more of the Courts of George I., George II., and
George III., during the early years of the last monarch, than
any other individual; and, though he lived to an extreme age,
the perpetual youthfulness of his disposition rendered him as
lively a chronicler when advanced in life, as when his
brilliant career commenced.  It is to this unceasing spring,
this unfading juvenility of spirit, that the world is indebted
for the gay colours with which Walpole invests every thing he
touches.  If the irresistible court beauties-the Gunnings, the
Lepels, and others-have been compelled, after their hundred
conquests, to yield to the ungallant liberties of Time, and to
Death, the rude destroyer, it is a delight to us to know that
their charms are destined to bloom for ever in the sparkling
graces of the patrician letter-writer.  In his epistles are to
be seen, even in more vivid tints than those of Watteau, these
splendid creatures in all the pride of their beauty and of
their wardrobe, pluming themselves as if they never could grow
old, and casting around them their piercing glances and no
less poignant raillery.  But Horace Walpole is not content
with thus displaying his dazzling bevy of heroines; he reveals
them in their less ostentatious moments, and makes us as
familiar with their weaknesses as with the despotic power of
their beauty.  Nothing that transpired in the great world
escaped his knowledge, nor the trenchant sallies of his wit,
rendered the more cutting by his unrivalled talent as a
raconteur.  Whatever he observed found its way into his
letters, and thus is formed a more perfect narrative of the
Curt-of its intrigues, political and otherwise-of the
manoeuvres of statesmen, the cabals of party, and of private
society among the illustrious and the fashionable of the last
century, at home and on the continent-than can elsewhere be
obtained.  And how piquant are his disclosures!  how much of
actual truth do they contain! how perfectly, in his
anecdotes, are to be traced the hidden and often trivial
sources of some of the most important public events!  "Sir
Joshua Reynolds," say the Edinburgh reviewers, "used to
observe, that, though nobody would for a moment compare Claude
to Raphael, there would be another Raphael before there was
another Claude; and we own, that we expect to see fresh Humes
and fresh Burkes, before we again fall in with that peculiar
combination of moral and intellectual qualities to which the
writings of Horace Walpole owe their extraordinary
popularity."

As a suitable introduction, prefixed to the whole collection
of letters, are the author's admirable "Reminiscences of the
Courts of George the First and Second," which were first
narrated to, and, in 1788, written for the amusement of Miss
Mary and Miss Agnes Berry.  To the former of these ladies the
public is indebted for a curious commentary on the
Reminiscences, contained in extracts from the letters of Sarah
Duchess of Marlborough, to the Earl of Stair, now first
published from the original manuscripts.  Of the Reminiscences
themselves it has been truly observed, that, both in manner
and matter, they are the very perfection of anecdote writing,
and make us better acquainted with the manners of George the
First and Second and their Courts, than we should be after
perusing a hundred heavy historians.

Of the most valuable of all Walpole's correspondence-his
letters to Sir Horace Mann-the history will appear in the
following Preface to that work, from the pen of the lamented
editor, the late Lord Dover:-

"In the Preface to the 'Memoires of the last Ten Years of the
Reign of George II. by Horace Walpole, Earl of Orford,'
published in the year 1822, is the following statement:-

"'Among the papers found at Strawberry Hill, after the death
of Lord Orford, was the following memorandum, wrapped in an
envelope, on which was written, Not to be opened till after my
will."

"'In my library at Strawberry Hill are two wainscot chests or
boxes, the larger marked with an A, the lesser with a B:-
I desire, that as soon as I am dead, my executor and executrix
will cord up strongly, and sell the larger box, marked A, and
deliver it to the Honourable Hugh Conway Seymour, to be kept
by him unopened and unsealed till the eldest son of Lady
Waldegrave, or whichever of her sons, being Earl of
Waldegrave, shall attain the age of twenty-five years; when
the said chest, with whatever it contains, shall be delivered
to him for his own.  And I beg that the Honourable Hugh Conway
Seymour, when be shall receive the said chest, will give a
promise in writing, signed by him, to Lady Waldegrave, that he
or his representatives will deliver the said chest, unopened
and unsealed, by my executor and executrix, to the first son
of Lady Waldegrave who shall attain the age of' twenty-five
years.  The key of the said chest is in one of the cupboards
of the green closet, within the blue breakfast room, at
Strawberry Hill; and that key, I desire, may be delivered to
Laura, Lady Waldegrave, to be kept by her till her son shall
receive the chest.'
"'March 21st, 1790.'"

(Signed) HON. HORACE WALPOLE, EARL OF ORFORD.'
Aug. 19, 1796.'

"In obedience to these directions, the box described in the
preceding memorandum was corded an(] sealed with the seals of
the Honourable Mrs. Damer and the late Lord Frederick
Campbell, the executrix and executor of Lord Orford, and by
them delivered to the late Lord Hugh Seymour, by whose
representatives it was given up, unopened and unsealed, to the
present Earl of Waldegrave, when he attained the age of
twenty-five.  On examining the box, it was found to contain a
number of manuscript volumes and other papers, among which
were the Memoires now published.' "

now first published, was also contained in the same box.  It
appears that Walpole, after the death of Sir Horace, became
again the possessor of his own letters.  He had them copied
very carefully in three volumes, and annotated them with short
notes, explanatory of the persons mentioned in them, with an
evident view to their eventual publication.
 "It is from these volumes that the present publication is
taken.  The notes of the author have also been printed
verbatim.  As, however, in the period of time which has
elapsed since Walpole's death, many of the personages
mentioned in the letters, whom he appears to have thought
sufficiently conspicuous not to need remark, have become
almost forgotten, the Editor has deemed it necessary to add,
as shortly as possible, some account of them; and he has taken
care, whenever he has done so, to distinguish his notes from
those of the original author, by the letter D. placed at the
end of them.

"This correspondence is perhaps the most interesting one of
Walpole's that has as yet appeared; as, in addition to his
usual merit as a letter-writer, and the advantage of great
ease, which his extreme intimacy with Sir Horace Mann gives to
his style, the letters to him are the most uninterrupted
series which has thus far been offered to the public.  They
are also the only letters of Walpole which give an account of
that very curious period when his father, Sir Robert Walpole,
left office.  In his letters hitherto published, there is a
great gap at this epoch; probably in consequence of his other
correspondents being at the time either in or near London.  A
Single letter to Mr. Conway, dated 'london, 1741,'-one to Mr.
West, dated 'May 4th, 1742,'-(none in 1743,) and one to Mr.
Conway, dated 'Houghton: Oct. 6th, 1744,' are all that appear
till 'may 18th, 1745,' when his letters to George Montagu
recommence, after an interval of eight years.  Whereas, in the
correspondence now published, there are no less than one
hundred and seventeen letters during that interval.

The letters of Walpole to Sir Horace Mann have also another
advantage over those of the same author previously published,
namely, that Sir Horace's constant absence from home, and the
distance of his residence from the British Islands, made every
occurrence that happened acceptable to him as news.  It)
consequence, his correspondent relates to him every thing that
takes place, both in the court and in society,-whether the
anecdotes are of a public or private nature,-hence the
collection of' letters to him becomes a most exact chronicle
of the events of the day, and elucidates very amusingly both
the manners of the time, and the characters of the persons
then alive.  In the sketches, however, of character, which
Walpole has thus left us, we must always remember that, though
a very quick and accurate observer, he was a man of many
prejudices; and that, above all, his hostility was unvarying
and unbounded with regard to any of his contemporaries, who
had been adverse to the person or administration of Sir Robert
Walpole.  This, though an amiable feeling, occasionally
carries him too far in his invectives, and renders him unjust
in his judgments.

"The answers of Sir Horace Mann are also preserved at
Strawberry Hill: they are very voluminous, but particularly
devoid of interest, as they are written in a dry heavy style,
and consist almost entirely of trifling details of forgotten
Florentine society, mixed with small portions of Italian
political news of the day, which are even still less amusing
than the former topic.  They have, however, been found useful
to refer to occasionally, in order to explain allusions in the
letters of Walpole.

"Sir Horace Mann was a contemporary and early friend of Horace
Walpole. (2) He was the second son of Robert Mann, of Linton,
in the county of Kent, Esq.  He was appointed in 1740 minister
plenipotentiary from England to the court of Florence-a post
he continued to occupy for the long period of forty-six years,
till his death, at an advanced age, November 6, 1786.  In 1755
he was created a baronet, with remainder to the issue of his
brother Galfridus Mann, and, in the reign of George the Third,
a knight of the Bath.  It will be observed that Walpole calls
his correspondent Mr. Mann, whereas the title-pages of' these
volumes, and all the notes which have been added by the editor
designate him as Sir Horace Mann.  This latter appellation is
undoubtedly, in the greater part of the correspondence, an
anachronism, as Sir Horace Mann was not made a baronet till
the year 1755; but, as he is best known to the world under
that designation, it was considered better to allow him the
title, by courtesy, throughout the work.

"As the following letters turn much upon the politics of the
day, and as the ignoble and unstable Governments which
followed that of Sir Robert Walpole are now somewhat
forgotten, it may not be unacceptable to the reader to be
furnished with a slight sketch of the political changes which
took place from the year 1742 to the death of George the
Second.

"At the general election of 1741, immense efforts were made by
the Opposition to the Walpole administration to strengthen
their phalanx-great sums were spent by their leaders in
elections, and an union was at length effected between the
Opposition or 'Patriots,' headed by Pulteney, and the Tories
or Jacobites, who had hitherto, though opposed to Walpole,
never acted cordially with the former.

"Sir Robert, upon the meeting of Parliament, exerted himself
with almost more than his usual vigour and talent, to resist
this formidable band of opponents; but the chances were
against him.  The timidity of his friends, and, if we may
believe Horace Walpole, the treachery of some of his
colleagues, and finally the majority in the House of Commons
against him, compelled him at length to resign; which he did
in the beginning of February, 1742.  Upon this step being
taken, and perhaps even before it, the Duke of Newcastle and
Lord Hardwicke, the two most influential members of Sir Robert
Walpole's cabinet, entered into communication with Mr.
Pulteney and Lord Carteret, the leaders of the regular
Opposition, with a view of forming a government, to the
exclusion of the Tories and Jacobites, and even of part of Mr.
Pulteney's own party.  The negotiation was successful; but it
was so at the expense of the popularity, reputation, and
influence of Pulteney, who never recovered the disgrace of
thus deserting his former associates.

"In consequence of these intrigues, the King agreed to send
for Lord Wilmington, and to place him at the head of the
ministry.  It is remarkable that this man, who was a mere
cipher, should have been again had recourse to, after his
failure in making a government at the very commencement of
the reign of George the Second, when his manifest incapacity,
and the influence of Queen Caroline, had occasioned the
remaining of his opponent Sir Robert Walpole in power.  With
Lord Wilmington came in Lord Harrington, as president of the
council; Lord Gower, as privy seal; Lord Winchilsea, as first
lord of the admiralty; Lord Carteret as secretary of state;
the other secretary being the Duke of Newcastle, who had been
so under Walpole; Lord Hardwicke continued chancellor; and
Samuel Sandys was made chancellor of the exchequer.  Several
of the creatures of Pulteney obtained minor offices: but he
himself, hampered by his abandonment of many of his former
friends, took no place; but Only obtained a promise of an
earldom, whenever he might wish for it.

"These arrangements produced, as was natural, a great schism
in the different parties, which broke out at a meeting at the
Fountain Tavern, on the 12th of February, where the Duke of
Argyll declared himself in opposition to the new government,
upon the ground of the unjust exclusion of the Tories.  The
Duke of Argyll subsequently relented, and kissed hands for the
master-generalship of the ordnance, upon the understanding,
that Sir John Hinde Cotton, a notorious Jacobite, was to have
a place.  This the King refused; upon which the Duke finally
subsided into Opposition.  Lord Stair had the ordnance, and
Lord Cobham was made a field-marshal and commander of the
forces in England.  This latter event happened at the end of
the session of 1742, when Lord Gower and Lord Bathurst, and
one or two other Jacobites, were promoted.  It was at this
period (July, 1742), that the King, by the advice of Sir
Robert Walpole, who saw that such a step would complete the
degradation Of Pulteney, insisted upon his taking out the
patent for his earldom and quitting the House of Commons;
which he did with the greatest unwillingness.

"On the death of Lord Wilmington, in July 1743, Mr.  Pelham
was made first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the
exchequer (from which office Sandys was dismissed), by the
advice of Sir Robert Walpole, and instead of Lord Bath, who
now found that his adversary had really turned the key upon
him, (3) and that the door of the cabinet was never to be
unlocked to him.  The ministry was at this time, besides its
natural feebleness, rent by internal dissensions; for Lord
Carteret, who, as secretary of state, had accompanied the King
abroad in 1743, had acquired great influence over his royal
master,-and trusting to this, and to the superiority of his
talents over his colleagues, his insolence to them became
unbounded.  The timid and time-serving Pelhams were quite
ready to humble themselves before him; but Lord Carteret was
not content with this: he was not content, unless he showed
them, and made them feel, all the contempt he entertained for
them.  In addition to these difficulties, Lord Gower resigned
the privy-seal in December 1743, upon the plea that no more
Tories were taken into office; but probably more from
perceiving that the administration could not go on.  Lord
Cobham also resigned, and went again into opposition.

"Finally, in November 1744, the greater part of the cabinet
having previously made their arrangements with the Opposition)
joined in a remonstrance to the King against Lord Carteret,
and offered, if he was not dismissed, their own resignations.
After some resistance, the King, again by the advice of Lord
Orford, yielded.  Lord Carteret and his adherents, and those
of Lord Bath, were dismissed, and a mixed government of Whigs
and Tories was formed.  Mr. Pelham continued first minister;
the Duke of Dorset was made president of the council; Lord
Gower again took the privy-seal, which had been held for a few
months by Lord Cholmondeley; the Duke of Bedford became first
lord of' the admiralty; Lord Harrincton secretary of state;
Lord Chesterfield, Lord Sandwich, George Grenville,
Doddington, and Lyttelton, and Sir John Hinde Cotton, Sir John
Philipps, and some other Tories, had places.  But though the
King had dismissed Lord Carteret (now become Earl of
Granville) from his councils, he had not from his confidence.
He treated his new ministers with coldness and incivility, and
consulted Lord Granville secretly upon all important points.

"At length, in the midst of the Rebellion, in August 1746, the
ministry went to the King, and gave him the option of taking
Pitt into office, which he had previously refused, or
receiving their resignations.  After again endeavouring in
vain to form an administration through the means of Lord
Granville and Lord Bath, the King was obliged to consent to
the demands of his ministers-and here may be said to commence
the leaden rule of the Pelhams, which continued to influence
the councils of this country, more or less, for so many years.
Pitt took the inferior, but lucrative office of paymaster; and
from this time no material change took place till the death of
Mr. Pelham, in March 1754, unless we except the admission of
Lord Granville to the cabinet in 1751, as president of the
council; an office which he contrived, with an interested
prudence very unlike his former conduct, to retain during all
succeeding ministries-and the getting rid of the Duke of
Bedford and Lord Sandwich, of whom the Pelhams had become
jealous.

The death of Pelham called into evidence the latent divisions
and hatreds of public Men, who had been hitherto acting in
concert.  Fox and Pitt were obviously the two persons, upon
one of whom the power of Pelham must eventually fall.  But the
intriguing Duke of Newcastle hated, and was jealous of both.
He, therefore, placed Sir Thomas Robinson in the House of
Commons, as secretary of state and leader, and made Henry
Bilson Legge chancellor of the exchequer, while he himself
took the treasury-leaving Fox (4) and Pitt in the subordinate
situations they had hitherto held.  The incapacity of Sir
Thomas Robinson became, however, soon so apparent, that a
change was inevitable.  This was hastened by a temporary
coalition between Fox and Pitt, which was occasioned,
naturally enough, by the ill-treatment they had both received
from the Duke of Newcastle.

"At length the latter reluctantly consented to admit Fox into
the cabinet, in 1755.  Upon this, Pitt again broke with Fox,
and went with his friends into opposition, with the exception
of Sir George Lyttelton, who became chancellor of the
exchequer.  The new government, however, lasted but one
session of parliament-its own dissensions, the talents of its
opponents, and the dissatisfaction of the King, who had been
thwarted in his German subsidiary treaties, aiding in its
downfall.

"The Duke of Devonshire, who had been very active in the
previous political negotiations, was now commissioned, in
1756, by the King to form a government.  The Duke of Newcastle
and Fox were turned out, and Pitt became lord of the
ascendant.  But the King's aversion to his new ministers was
even greater than it had been to his old; and in February
1757, he commissioned Lord Waldegrave to endeavour to form a
government, with the assistance of Newcastle and Fox.  In this
undertaking he failed, very mainly through the irresolutions
and jealousies of Newcastle.  Thus circumstanced, the King,
however unwillingly, was obliged to deliver himself up into
the hands of Pitt, Who (in June, 1757) succeeded in forming
that administration, which was destined to be one of the most
glorious ones England has ever seen.  He placed himself at the
head of it, holding the situation of secretary of state and
leader of the House of Commons, leaving the Duke of Newcastle
at the head of the treasury, and placing Legge again in the
exchequer.  This administration lasted till the reign of the
succeeding sovereign."

To his edition of the Letters to Sir Horace Mann, Lord Dover
appended illustrative notes, which are retained in the
present.  Of the manner in which his lordship executed the
office of editor and annotator, the Edinburgh Review thus
speaks, in a brilliant article on those Letters, which
appeared in the number of that work for January 1834:-"The
editing of these volumes was the last of the useful and modest
services rendered to literature by a nobleman of amiable
manners, of untarnished public and private character, and of
cultivated mind.  On this, as on other occasions, Lord Dover
performed his part diligently, judiciously, and without the
slightest ostentation.  He had two merits, both of which are
rarely found together in a commentator: he was content to be
merely a commentator,-to keep in the background, and to leave
the foreground to the author whom he had undertaken to
illustrate.  yet, though willing to be an attendant, he was by
no means a slave; nor did he consider it as part of his
editorial duty to see no faults in the writer to whom he
faithfully and assiduously rendered the humblest literary
offices."

It remains only to add, that the original notes of Horace
Walpole are throughout retained, undistinguished by any
signature; whereas, those of the various editors are
indicated by a characteristic initial, which is explained in
the progress of the work.

(2) The coincidence of remarkable names in the two families of
Mann and Walpole, would lead one to imagine that there was
also some connection of relationship between them-and yet none
is to be traced in the pedigree of either family.  Sir Robert
Walpole had two brothers named Horace and Galfridus-and Sir
Horace Mann's next brother was named Galfridus Mann.  If such
a relationship did exist, it probably came through the
Burwells, the family of Sir Robert Walpole's mother.

                                          ADVERTISEMENT.


To the first edition of Lord Orford's works, which was
published the year after he died, no memoir of his life was
prefixed: his death                     was too recent, his
life and character was too well known, his works
     too popular, to require it.  His political Memoirs, and
the collections of his Letters which have been subsequently
published, were edited by persons, who, though well qualified
for their task in every other respect, have failed in their
account of his private life, and their
appreciation of his individual character, from the want of a
personal acquaintance with their author.

The life contained in Sir Walter Scott's Biographical Sketches
of the English Novelists labours under the same disadvantages.
He had never seen Lord Orford, nor even lived with such of his
intimates and contemporaries in society as survived him.

Lord Dover, who has so admirably edited the first part of his
correspondence with Sir Horace Mann, knew Lord Orford only by
having been carried sometimes, when a boy, by his father Lord
Clifden to Strawberry Hill.  His editorial labours with these
letters were the last occupation of his accomplished mind, and
were pursued while his body was fast sinking under the
complication of disease, which so soon after deprived Society
Of One Of its most distinguished members, the arts of an
enlightened patron, and his intimates of an amiable and
attaching friend.  Of the meagreness and insufficiency of his
memoir of Lord Orford's life prefixed to the letters, he was
himself aware, and expressed to the author of these pages his
inability then to improve it, and his regret that
circumstances had deprived him, while it was yet time, of the
assistance of those who could have furnished him with better
materials.  His account of the latter part of Lord Orford's
life is deficient in details, and sometimes erroneous as to
dates.  He appears likewise to have been unacquainted with
some of his writings, and the circumstances which led to and
accompanied them.  In the present publication those
deficiencies are supplied from notes, in the hands of the
writer, left by Lord Orford, of the dates of the principal
events of his own life, and of the writing and publication of
all his works.  It is only to be regretted that his
autobiography is so short, and so entirely confined to dates.
In estimating the character of Lord Orford, and in the opinion
which he gives of his talents, Lord Dover has evinced much
candour and good taste.  He praises with discrimination, and
draws no unfair inferences from the peculiarities of a
character with which he was not personally acquainted.

It is by the Review of the Letters to Sir Horace Mann, that
the severest condemnation has been passed and the most unjust
impressions given, not only of the genius and talents, but of
the heart and character, of Lord Orford.  The mistaken
opinions of the eloquent and accomplished author (5) of that
review are to be traced chiefly to the same causes which
defeated the intentions of the two first biographers.  In his
case, these causes were increased, not only by no acquaintance
with his subject, but by still farther removal from the
fashions, the social habits, the little minute details, of the
age to which Horace Walpole belongs,-an age so essentially
different from the business, the movement, the important
struggles, of that which claims the critic as one of its most
distinguished ornaments.  A conviction that these reasons led
to his having drawn up, from the supposed evidence of
Walpole's works alone, a character of their  author so
entirely and offensively unlike the original, has forced the
pen into the feeble and failing hand of the writer of these
pages,-has imposed the pious duty of attempting to rescue, by
incontrovertible facts, acquired in long intimacy, the memory
of an old and beloved friend, from the giant grasp of an
author and a critic from whose judgment, when deliberately
formed, few can hope to appeal with success.  The candour, the
good-nature of this critic,-the inexhaustible stores of his
literary acquirements, which place him in the first rank of
those most distinguished for historical knowledge and critical
acumen,-will allow him, I feel sure, to forgive this appeal
from his hasty and general opinion, to the judgment of his
better informed mind, on the peculiarities of' a character
often remarkably dissimilar from that of his works.

Lord Dover has justly and forcibly remarked, "that what did
the most honour both to the head and the' heart of Horace
Walpole, was the friendship which he bore to Marshal Conway; a
man who, according to all the accounts of him that have come
down to us, was so truly worthy of inspiring such a decree of
affection." (6)
He then quotes the character given of him by the editor of
Lord Orford's works in 1798.  This character of Marshal Conway
was a portrait drawn from the life, and, as it proceeded from
the same pen which now traces these lines, has some right to
be inserted here.  "It is only those who have had the
opportunity of penetrating into the most secret motives of his
public conduct, and into the inmost recesses of his private
life, who can do real justice to the unsullied purity of his
character;-who saw and knew him in the evening of his days,
retired from the honourable activity of a soldier and of a
statesman, to the calm enjoyments of private -life; happy in
the resources of his own mind, and in the cultivation of
useful science, in the bosom of domestic peace-unenriched by
pensions or places-undistinguished by titles or
ribbons-unsophisticated by public life, and unwearied by
retirement."

To this man, Lord Orford's attachment, from their boyish days
at Eton school to the death of Marshal Conway in 1795, is
already a circumstance of sufficiently rare occurrence among
men of the world.  Could such a man, of whom the foregoing
lines are an unvarnished sketch-of whose character, simplicity
was one of the distinguished ornaments-could such a man have
endured the intimacy of such an individual as the reviewer
describes Lord Orford to have been?  Could an intercourse of
uninterrupted friendship and undiminished confidence have
existed between them during a period of nearly sixty
             years, undisturbed by the business and bustle of
middle life, so apt to cool, and often to terminate, youthful
friendships? Could such an intercourse ever have existed, with
the supposed selfish indifference, and artificial coldness and
conceit of Lord Orford's character?

The last correspondence included in the present publication
will, it is presumed, furnish no less convincing proof, that
the warmth of his feelings, and his capacity for sincere
affection, continued unenfeebled by age.  It is with this
view, and this alone, that the correspondence alluded to is
now, for the first time, given to the public.  It can add
nothing to the already established epistolary fame of Lord
Orford, and the public can be as little interested in his
sentiments for the two individuals addressed.  But, in forming
a just estimate of his character, the reader will hardly fail
to observe that those sentiments were entertained at a time of
life when, for the most part, the heart is too little capable
of expansion to open to new attachments.  The whole tone of
these letters must prove the unimpaired warmth of his
feelings, and form a striking contrast to the cold harshness
of which he has                         been accused, in his
intercourse with Madame du Deffand, at an earlier period of
his life.  This harshness, as was noticed by the editor of
Madame du Deffand's letters, in the preface to that
publication, proceeded solely from a dread of ridicule, which
formed a principal feature of Mr. Walpole's character, and
which, carried, as in his case, to excess, must be called a
principal weakness.  "This accounts for the ungracious
language in which he so often replies to the importunities of
her anxious affection; a language so foreign to his heart, and
so contrary to his own habits in friendship." (7)

Is this, then, the man who is supposed to be "the most
eccentric, the most artificial, the most fastidious, the most
capricious of mortals?  -his mind a bundle of inconsistent
whims and affectations-his features covered with mask within
mask, which, when the outer disguise of obvious affectation
was removed, you were still as far as ever from seeing the
real man."-"Affectation is the essence of the man.  It pervades
all his thoughts and all his expressions.  If it were taken
away, nothing would be left." (8)

He affected nothing; he played no part; he was what he
appeared to be.  Aware that he was ill qualified for politics,
for public life, for parliamentary business, or indeed for
business of any sort, the whole tenor of his life was
consistent with this opinion of himself.  Had he attempted to
effect what belongs only to characters of another stamp -had
he endeavoured to take a lead in the House of Commons-had he
sought for place, dignity, or office-had he aimed at intrigue,
or attempted to be a tool for others-then, indeed, he might
have deserved the appellation of artificial, eccentric, and
capricious.

>From the retreat of his father, which happened the year after
he entered parliament, the only real interest he took in
politics was when their events happened immediately to concern
the objects of his private friendships.  He occupied himself
with what really amused him.  If he had affected any thing, it
would certainly not have been a taste for the trifling
occupations with which he is reproached.  Of no person can it
be less truly said, that "affectation was the essence of the
man."  What man, or even what woman, ever affected to be the
frivolous being he is described?  When his critic says, that
he had "the soul of a gentleman-usher," he was little aware
that he only repeated what Lord Orford often said of
himself-that from his knowledge of old ceremonials and
etiquettes, he was sure that in a former state of existence,
he must have been a gentleman-usher,-about the time of
Elizabeth.

In politics, he was what he professed to be, a Whig, in the
sense which that denomination bore in his younger days,-never
a Republican.

In his old and enfeebled age, the horrors of the first French
revolution made him a Tory; while he always lamented, as one
of the worst effects of its excesses, that they must
necessarily retard to a distant period the progress and
establishment of civil liberty.  But why are we to believe his
contempt for crowned heads should have prevented his writing a
memoir of "Royal and Noble Authors?"  Their literary labours,
when all brought together by himself, would not, it is
believed, tend much to raise, or much to alter his opinion of
them.

In his letters from Paris, written in the years 1765, 1766,
1767 and 1771, it will be seen, that so far from being
infinitely more occupied with "the fashions and gossip of
Versailles and Marli than with a great moral revolution which
was taking place in his sight," he was truly aware of the
state of the public mind, and foresaw all that was coming on.

Of Rousseau he has proved that he knew more, and that he
judged him more accurately, than Mr. Hume, and many others who
were then duped by his mad pride and disturbed understanding.

Voltaire had convicted himself of the basest of vain lies in
the intercourse he sought with Mr. Walpole.  The details of
this transaction, and the letters which passed at the time,
are already printed in the quarto edition of his works.     In
the short notes of his life left by himself, and from which
all the dates in this notice are taken, it is thus mentioned:

"Although Voltaire, with whom I had never had the least
acquaintance, had voluntarily written to me first, and asked
for my book, he wrote a letter to the Duchesse de Choiseul, in
which, without saying                              a syllable
of his having written to me first, he told her I had
officiously   sent him my works, and declared war with him in
defence  'de ce bouffon de Shakspeare,' whom in his reply to
me he pretended so much to admire.  The Duchesse sent me
Voltaire's letter; which gave me such a contempt for his
disingenuity, that I dropped all correspondence with him."

When he spoke with contempt of d'Alembert, it was not of his
abilities; of which he never pretended to judge.  Professor
Saunderson had long before, when he was a lad at Cambridge,
assured him, that it would be robbing him to pretend teaching
him mathematics, of which his mind was perfectly incapable, so
that any comparison of the intellectual powers of the two men"
would indeed be as "exquisitely ridiculous" as the critic
declares it.  But lord Orford, speaking of d'Alembert,
complains of the overweening importance which he, and all the
men of letters of those days in France, attributed to their
squabbles and disputes.  The idleness to which an absolute
government necessarily condemns  nine-tenths of its subjects,
sufficiently accounts for the exaggerated importance given to
and assumed by the French writers, even before they had
become, in the language of the Reviewer, "the interpreters
between England and mankind:" he asserts, "that all the great
discoveries in physics, in metaphysics, in political science,
are ours but no foreign nation, except France, has received
them from us by direct communication: isolated in our
situation, isolated by our manners, we found truth, but did
not impart it." (9)  It may surely be asked, whether France
will subscribe to this assertion of superiority, in the whole
range of science!  If she does, her character has undergone an
even greater change, than any she has yet experienced in the
course of all her revolutions.

lord Orford is believed by his critic to have "sneered" at
every body. sneering was not his way of showing dislike.  He
had very strong prejudices, sometimes adopted on very
insufficient grounds, and he therefore often made great
mistakes in the appreciation of character; but when influenced
by such impressions, he always expressed his opinions
directly, and often too violently.

The affections of his heart were bestowed on few; for in early
life they had never been cultivated, but they were singularly
warm, pure, and constant; characterized not by the ardour of
passion, but by the constant preoccupation of real affection.
He had lost his mother, to whom he was fondly attached, early
in life; and with his father, a man of coarse feelings and
boisterous manners, he had few sentiments in common.  Always
feeble in constitution, he was unequal to the sports of the
field, and to the drinking which then accompanied them, so
that during his father's retreat at Houghton, however much he
respected his abilities and was devoted to his fame, he had
little sympathy in his tastes, or pleasure in his society.  To
the friends of his own selection his devotion was not confined
to professions or words: on all occasions of difficulty, of
whatever nature, his active affection came forward in defence
of their character, or assistance in their affairs.

When his friend Conway, as second in command under Sir John
Mordaunt, in the expedition to St. Maloes, partook in some
degree of the public censure called forth by the failure of
these repeated ill-judged attempts on the coasts of France,
Walpole's pen was immediately employed in rebutting the
accusations of the popular pamphlet of the day on this
subject, And establishing his friend's exemption from any
responsibility in the failure.  When, on a more important
occasion, Mr. Conway was not only dismissed from being Equerry
to the King, George III., but from the command of his
regiment, for his constitutional conduct and votes in the
House of Commons, in the memorable affair of the legality of
General Warrants for the seizure of persons and papers,
Walpole immediately stepped forward, not with cold
commendations of his friend's upright and spirited conduct,
but with all the confidence Of long-tried affection, and all
the security of noble minds incapable of misunderstanding each
other, he insisted on being allowed to share in future his
fortune with his friend, and thus more than repair the
pecuniary loss he had incurred.  Mr. Conway, in a letter to
his brother, Lord Hertford, of this period, says "Horace
Walpole has on this occasion shown that warmth of friendship
that you know him capable of so, strongly, that I want words
to express my sense of it;" (10) thus proving the justice he
did to Walpole's sentiments and intentions.

In the case of General Conway's near relationship and intimacy
from childhood, the cause in which his fortunes were suffering
might have warmed a colder heart, and opened a closer hand,
than Mr. Walpole's: but Madame du Deffand was a recent
acquaintance, who had no claim on him, but the pleasure he
received from her society, and his desire that her blind and
helpless old age might not be deprived of any of the comforts
and alleviations of which it was capable.  When by the
financial arrangements of the French government, under the
unscrupulous administration of the Abb`e Terray, the creditors
of the state were considerably reduced in income, Mr. Walpole,
in the most earnest manner, begged to prevent the
unpleasantness of his old friend's exposing her necessities,
and imploring aid from the minister of the day, by allowing
him to make up the deficit in her revenue, as a loan, Or in
any manner that would be most satisfactory to her.  The loss,
after all, did not fall on that stock from which she derived
her income, and the assistance was not accepted; but Madame du
Deffand's confidence in, and opinion of, the offer, we see in
her letters.

During his after life, although no ostentatious contributor to
public charities and schemes of improvement, the friends in
whose opinion he knew he could confide, had always more
difficulty to repress than to excite his liberality.

That he should have wished his friend Conway to be employed as
commander on military expeditions, which, as a soldier fond of
his profession, he naturally coveted, although Mr. Walpole
might disapprove of the policy of the minister in sending out
such expeditions, surely implies neither disguise, nor
contradiction in his opinions.

The dread which the reviewer supposes him to have had, lest he
should lose caste as a gentleman, by ranking as a wit and an
author, he was much too     fine a gentleman to have believed
in the possibility of feeling.  He knew he had never studied
since he left college; he knew that he was not at all a
learned man: but the reputation he had acquired by his wit and
by his writings, not only among fine gentlemen, but with
society in general, made him nothing loath to cultivate every
opportunity of increasing it.  The account he gave of the
idleness of his life to Sir Horace Mann, when he disclaims the
title of "the learned gentleman," was literally true; and it
is not easy to imagine any reason why a man at the age of
forty-three, who admits that he is idle, and who renounces
being either a learned man or a politician, should be
"ashamed" of playing loo in good company till two or three
o'clock in the morning, if he neither ruins himself nor
others. (11)  He wrote his letters as rapidly as his disabled
fingers would allow him to form the characters of a remarkably
legible hand.  No rough draughts or sketches of familiar
letters were found amongst his papers at Strawberry Hill: but
he was in the habit of putting down on the backs of letters or
on slips of paper, a note of facts, of news, of witticisms, or
of any thing he wished not to forget, for the amusement of his
correspondents.

After reading "The Mysterious Mother," who will accede to the
opinion, that his works are "destitute of every charm that is
derived from elevation, or from tenderness of sentiment?" (12)

But, with opinions as to the genius, the taste, or the talents
of Lord Orford, this little notice has nothing to do.  It aims
solely at rescuing his individual character from
misconceptions.  Of the means necessary for this purpose, its
writer, by the "painful preeminence" of age, remains the sole
depositary, and being so, has submitted to the task of
repelling such misconceptions.  It is done with the reluctance
which must always be experienced in differing from, or calling
in question, the opinions of a person, for whom is felt all
the admiration and respect due to super-eminent abilities, and
all the grateful pride and affectionate regard inspired by
personal friendship.

                           Second Advertisement


THE last volume will be found to contain upwards of one hundred
letters, introduced into no former edition of the Correspondence
of Horace Walpole.  The greater part of them were written between
the years 1789 and 1797, and were addressed to the Miss Berrys,
during their residence in Italy.  They embrace most of the
leading events of the first five years of the French Revolution;
and wherever the facts detailed in the letters have appeared to
require elucidation or confirmation, the Editor has generally had
recourse to M. Thiers's useful "History" of that great event;
which has recently appeared in an English dress, accompanied with
notes and illustrations, drawn from the most authentic sources.

While the last volume was at press, the Editor was favoured with
a letter from the Right Honourable Sir Charles Grey, relative to
the share which he considers Mr. Walpole to have had in the
composition and publication of the Letters of Junius.

             TO THE EDITOR OF THE LETTERS OF HORACE WALPOLE,
                             EARL OF ORFORD.



Sir,

1. Before your last volume is published, I am desirous of stating
to you some of the considerations which, more than seventeen
years ago, led me to the belief I still entertain, that Walpole
had a principal share in the composition and publication of the
Letters of Junius: though I think it likely that Mason, or some
other friend corrected the style, and gave precision and force to
the most striking passages.

2. It was in 1823, whilst I was residing in India, that Lord
Holland's edition of Walpole's Memoires of the Last Ten Years of
the Reign of George the Second suggested to me this notion; and
it was shortly afterwards communicated to several of my friends.
The edition of Junius which I had with me, was that of Mr.
Woodfall the younger, in three volumes; and I am not at present
by any means satisfied that all the letters which the editor
assigns to Junius were written by him: but in this hasty notice I
must proceed upon the supposition that they were.

3. It will be remembered that the Memoires were composed by
Walpole in secrecy, and that he left them in a sealed box, which,
by his will, was forbidden to be opened till many years after his
death.  The letters from which the corresponding passages are
given below are all published as Letters of Junius by Mr.
Woodfall, and are of dates later than the time when Walpole wrote
his Memoires; but half a century earlier than the time when they
were printed.

Note by the transcriber: there follows a table, in which letters
of Junius are presented for comparisons side by side with
writings
of Walpole.  I have changed the format to present them in
sequence.  Return to text.

Junius:
I own, my lord, that yours is not an uncommon character.  Women,
and men like women, are timid, vindictive, and irresolute.
Woodfall's Junius, vol. ii, p. 168.

Walpole:
As it is observed that timorous natures like those of women are
generally cruel, Lord mansfield might easily slide into rigour,
etc.-Walpole's Memoires, vol. ii. p. 175.

Junius:
Without openly supporting the person, you (Lord Mansfield) have
done essential service to the cause; and consoled yourself for
the loss of a favourite family by reviving and establishing the
maxims of their government.-vol. ii, p. 182.

Walpole:
The occasions of the times had called him (Lord Mansfield) off
from principles that favoured an arbitrary king-he still leaned
towards an arbitrary government.-vol. ii. p. 266.

Junius:
You (Lord Mansfield) would fain be thought to take no share in
government, while in reality you are the mainspring of the
machine.-vol. ii. p. 179.

Walpole:
Pitt liked the dignity of despotism; Lord Mansfield the
reality.-Vol. ii. p. 274.

Junius:
You secretly engross the power, while you decline the title of
minister.-vol. ii. p.179.

Walpole:
He was timid himself, and always waving what he was always
courting.-Vol. ii. p. 336.

Junius:
In council he generally affects to take a moderate part.-vol. ii.
p. 354.
At present there is something oracular in the delivery of my
opinion.  I speak from a recess which no human curiosity can
penetrate.-vol. i. p. 314.

Walpole:
The conduct was artful, new and grand: secluded from all eyes,
his (Lord Chatham's) orders were received as oracles.-vol. ii. p.
347.

Junius:
Our enemies treat us as the cunning trader does the unskilful
Indian.  they magnify their generosity when they give us baubles
of no proportionate value for ivory and gold.-vol. ii. p. 359.

Walpole:
They made a legal purchase to all eternity of empires and
posterity, from a parcel of naked savages, for a handful of glass
beads and baubles.-Vol. i. p. 343.

Junius:
If you deny him the cup, there will be no keeping him within the
pale of the ministry.-vol. ii. p. 249.

Walpole:
Where I believe the clergy do not deny the laity the cup.-Letter
to Montague.
He took care to regulate his patron's warmth within the pale of
his own advantage.-Memoires, vol. ii. p. 197.
Come over to the pale of loyalty.-vol. i. p. 282.

Junius:
Honour and justice must not be renounced although a thousand
modes of right and wrong were to occupy the degrees of morality
between Zeno and Epicurus.  The fundamental principles of
Christianity may still be preserved.-vol. ii. p. 346.

Walpole:
The modes of Christianity were exhausted.-Vol. ii. p. 282
To mark how much the modes of thinking change, and that
fundamentals themselves can make no impression.-vol. ii. p. 265.

Junius:
He (the duke of Bedfor) would not have betrayed such ignorance or
such contempt of the constitution as openly to avow in a court of
judicature the purchase and sale of a borough.
Note.- In an answer in chancery in a suit against him to recover
a large sum paid him by a person whom he had undertaken to return
to parliament for one of his Grace's boroughs.  He was compelled
to repay the money.-vol. i. p. 576.

Walpole:
Corruption prevailed in the House of Commons.  Instances had been
brought to our courts of judicature how much it prevailed in our
elections.
Note.-The Duke of Bedford had received 1500 pounds for electing
Jefrery French at one of his boroughs in the west; but he dying
immediately, his heir sued the Duke for the money, who paid it,
rather than let the cause be heard.

Junius:
The Princess Dowager made it her first care to inspire her son
with horror against heresy, and with a respect for the church.
His mother took more pains to form his beliefs than either his
morals or his understanding.-vol. iii. p. 408.

Walpole:
>From the death of the Prince the object of the Princess Dowager
had been the government of her son; and her attention had
answered.  She had taught him great devotion, and she had taken
care that he should be taught nothing else.-Vol. i. p. 396.

Junius:
That prince had strong natural parts, and used frequently to
blush for his own ignorance and want of education, which had been
wilfully neglected by his mother and her minion.

Walpole:
Martin spoke for the clause, and said, "The King could not have a
separate interest from his people, the Princess might; witness
Queen Isabella and her minion Mortimer."-Vol. i. p. 118.

Transcriber's note: the following paragraph is surrounded by
asterisks.  it appears to be a comment by the letter writer, sir
charles Grey, rather than either Junius or Walpole.

Our great Edward, too, at an early period, had sense enough to
understand the nature of the connexion between his abandoned
mother and the detested Mortimer.

Junius:
when it was proposed to settle the present King's household as
Prince of Wales, it is well known that the Earl of Bute was
forced into it in direct contradiction to the late King's
inclination. vol. ii. .-

Walpole:
Fox had an audience.  The monarch was sour, but endeavoured to
keep his temper, yet made no concessions; no request to the
retiring minister to stay.  At last he let slip the true cause of
his indignation: "You," said he, "have made me make that puppy
Bute groom of the
stole."-Vol. ii. p. 92.

Though too long to be cited in these hurried notes, there are
several other passages in which the coincidence of sentiment and
expression and of the order in which the thoughts and arguments
are ranged, is very remarkable: and the difficulty of accounting
otherwise for such coincidences between the Letters of Junius and
the unpublished and secret Memoires of Walpole, first made me
suspect that the two names might belong to one and the same
person-Horace Walpole the younger.

4. Being led by this conjecture to examine the other works of
Walpole, I found, in them also, many echoes, as it were, of the
voice of Junius, which it is singular should not have been more
observed.  No One, I think, can collate the concluding portion of
Walpole's letter to Lord Bute, of February 15, 1762, and the
latter part of the eulogium of Junius on Lord Chatham, without
being struck by the similarity of manner and tone; and by the
identity of that feeling, which, in both cases, prompts the
writer, whilst he is elaborating compliments, to defend himself
jealously against all suspicion of flattery or interested
motives.

Transcriber's note: there follows a comparison of material from
Junius and Walpole, set out in parallel columns.  I have changed
these to a sequential arrangement.

Junius:
I did not intend to make a public declaration of the respect I
bear Lord Chatham.  I well knew what unworthy conclusions would
be drawn from it.  But I am called upon to deliver my opinion,
and surely it is not in the little censure of Mr. Home to deter
me from doing signal justice to a man who, I confess, has grown
upon my esteem.  As for the common, sordid views of avarice, or
any purpose of vulgar ambition, I question whether the applause
of Junius would be of service to Lord Chatham.  My vote will
hardly recommend him to an increase of his pension, or to a seat
in the Cabinet.  But if his ambition be upon a level with his
understanding; if he judges of what is truly honourable for
himself with the same superior genius which animates and directs
him to eloquence in debate, to wisdom in decision, even the pen
of Junius shall contribute to reward him.  Recorded honour shall
gather round his monument, and thicken over him.  It is a solid
fabric, and will support the laurels that adorn it.  I am not
conversant in the language of panegyric.  These praises are
extorted from me; but they will wear well, for they have been
dearly earned.-Vol. ii. p. 310.

WALPOLE.
I did not purpose to tempt again the patience of mankind.  But
the case is very different with regard to my trouble.  My whole
fortune is from the bounty of the Crown and from the public: it
would ill become me to spare any pains for the King's glory, or
for the honour and satisfaction of my country; and give me leave
to add, my lord, it would be an ungrateful return for the
distinction with which your lordship has condescended to honour
me if I withheld such trifling aid as mine, when it might in the
least tend to adorn your lordship's administration.  From me, my
lord, permit me to say these are not words of course, or of
compliment, this is not the language of flattery: your lordship
knows I have no views; perhaps knows that, insignificant as it
is, my praise is never detached from my esteem: and when you have
raised, as I trust you will, real monuments of glory, the most
contemptible characters in the inscription dedicated by your
country, may not be the testimony of, my lord, your lordship's
most obedient humble servant.-Letters, vol. iii.

I have neither time nor space for going much farther into this
part of the subject; but there is one circumstance which, in its
application to the supposition that Francis was Junius, is too
remarkable to be passed over.  Sir Philip Francis supplied Mr.
Almon with reports of two speeches of Lord Chatham, in one of
which there is this passage, "The Americans had Purchased their
liberty at a dear rate, since they had quitted their native
country and gone in search of freedom to a desert."  Junius,
about three weeks before, had said, "They left their native land
in search of freedom, and found it in a desert;" and it has been
inferred from this, that the words in the speech were not Lord
Chatham's, but the reporter's, and that Sir Philip Francis was
Junius.  But it happens that Walpole, in his Royal and Noble
Authors, some years earlier than either the letter of Junius or
the speech of Lord Chatham, had said of Lord Brooke, that he was
on the point "Of seeking liberty in the forests of America."

5. If we turn from a recollection of the words to a consideration
of the peculiarities of the style of Junius, I think it will be
agreed that the most remarkable of all is that species of irony
which consists in equivocal compliment.  Walpole also excelled in
this; and prided himself upon doing so.  Are we not justified in
saying, that of all who, in the eighteenth century, cast their
thoughts on public occurrences into the form of letters, Junius
and Walpole are the most distinguished! that the works of no
other prose writer of their time exhibit a zest for political
satire equal to that which is displayed in the Letters of Junius,
and in the Memoires and Political Letters of Walpole  and that
the sarcasm of equivocal praise was the favourite weapon in the
armoury of each, though it certainly appears to have been
tempered, and sharpened, and polished with additional care for
the hand of Junius?  When did Francis ever deal in compliment or
in equivoque?  In his vituperation there was always more of fury
than of malice: but Junius and Walpole were cruel.  Madame du
Deffand says to the latter, "Votre plume est de fer tremp`e dans
de fiel."  I have sometimes thought that clever old woman either
knew or suspected him to be Junius.  She uses in one place the
unusual expression, "Votre `ecrit de Junius:" and if Walpole was
Junius, some of the most carefully composed letters in 1769 and
1771 were written in Paris ; where, indeed, it would seem that
Junius, whoever he was, collected the materials for the
accusation with which he threatened the Duke of Bedford, and
which he evidently knew to be untrue.

6. It has sometimes been said, that the Letters of Junius must
have been written by a lawyer, and they were at one time
attributed even to Mr. Dunning.  The mistakes which I am about to
notice, trifling as they may be, make it impossible that any
lawyer should have been the author; and it appears to me that not
only is there a considerable resemblance in those mistakes which
I adduce of Walpole's, but that the affectation in both of
employing legal terms with which they were not familiar, and of
which they did not distinctly apprehend the meaning, is very
remarkable.  Junius thought De Lolme's Essay deep," (13) and
talks of property which "savours of the reality:" (14) he
misapplies that trite expression of the courts, bona fide: (15)
misunderstands mortmain, (16) and supposes that an inquisitio
post mortem was an inquiry how the deceased came by his death.
(17)  Walpole talks of "the purparty of a wife's lands;" of
"tenures against which, of all others, quo warrantos are sure to
take place;" (18) of the days of soccage," which he supposes to
be obsolete; and of a fera naturae.

Transcriber's note: Again there are a few passages from Junius
and Walpole compared in parallel columns, which I present below
in sequence.

Junius:
You say the facts on which you reason are universally admitted: a
gratis dictum which I flatly deny.-vol. ii. p. 143.

Walpole:
This circumstance is alleged against them as an incident
contrived to gain belief, as if they had been in danger of their
lives.  The argument is gratis dictum.-Works, vol. ii. p. 568.


Junius:
They are the trustees, not the owners of the estate.  the fee
simple is in us.- vol.-vol. i. p. 345.

Walpole:
Do you think we shall purchase the fee simple of him for so many
years?-Letters, vol. ii.

7. Walpole's time of life, his station in society, means of
information, and habits of writing much, and anonymously, and in
concealment, all tally with the supposition of his being Junius.
So do his places of residence, when that part of the subject is
carefully examined.

8. It is an odd circumstance that Walpole, who makes remarks on
every thing, makes no remark on Junius.  If he ever expressed an
opinion of him in his letters to any of his numerous
correspondents, those letters have been suppressed.  There are
fewer letters of his in the years during which Junius was
writing, than in any others.

9. Walpole's quarrel with the Duke and Duchess of Bedford, and
The party whom he calls "the Bedford court," and Junius "the
Bloomsbury gang," would account for the rancour of the letters of
the latter to the Duke.


10. Walpole's dislike and opinion of the Duke of Grafton, which
is nowhere more remarkably expressed than in a letter published
for the first time in your third volume, coupled with his
friendship for the first Duchess of Grafton, fall in with the
attacks of Junius on the Duke.

11. The Memoires of Walpole show an enmity to Lord Mansfield
almost equal to that of Junius.

12. Turning from these to a person in a different station, we
find, on the part of Walpole, (and, by-the-by, of Mason too,) a
sort of spite against Dr. Johnson; and in the works of Walpole,
selected by himself for publication after his death,' there is a
high-wrought criticism and condemnation of the style of Johnson,
which I cannot help believing to have been conceived in revenge
of the well-known handling of Junius in Johnson's pamphlet on the
Falkland Islands.  "Let not injudicious admiration mistake the
venom of the shift for the vigour of the bow," is said by Johnson
of Junius: and Walpole says of Johnson, that "he destroys more
enemies by the weight of his shield, than with the point of his
spear."

13. There is a host of small facts which might be adduced in
support of what I have advanced.  Any one who has leisure to
examine the voluminous works of Walpole, and who can lend his
mind to the inquiry, will find them crowd upon him.  Let me
mention one well known occurrence.

Junius says, in the postscript of a private note to Mr. Woodfall,
Beware of David Garrick.  He was sent to pump you, and went
directly to Richmond to tell the King I should write no more." He
then directed Woodfall to send the following note to Garrick, but
not in the handwriting of Junius:-"I am very exactly informed of
your impertinent inquiries, and of the information you so busily
sent to Richmond, and with what triumph and exultation it was
received.  I knew every particular of it the next day.  Now, mark
me, vagabond!  Keep to your pantomimes, or be assured you shall
hear of it.  Meddle no more, thou busy informer! It is in my
power to make you curse the hour in which you dared to interfere
with Junius." (19)

Mr. Woodfall remarks on this, that Garrick had received a letter
from Woodfall, (the editor of the newspaper in which the letters
of Junius first appeared,) before the above-note of Junius was
sent to the printer, in which Garrick was told, in confidence,
that there were some doubts whether Junius would continue to
write much longer.  Garrick flew with the intelligence to Mr.
Remus, one of the pages to the King, who immediately conveyed it
to his Majesty, at that time residing at Richmond; and from the
peculiar sources of information that were open to this
extraordinary writer, Junius was apprised of the whole
transaction on the ensuing morning, and wrote the above
postscript, and the letter that follows it, in consequence.  Now
all that appears to Mr. Woodfall the younger. to be so wonderful
in these circumstances is very easily explained, if we suppose
Walpole to have been Junius.  Strawberry Hill is very near
Richmond Park, and Walpole had many acquaintances amongst those
who were about the King; whilst his friend, Mrs. Clive, the
actress, who lived in the adjoining house to his own, and her
brother, Mr. Raftor, who frequently visited her, both belonged to
Garrick's company.

But I have extended this letter too far.  My purpose was merely
to invite your attention to a subject of some literary interest,
which you have peculiar opportunities of examining; and to enable
you, if you should think fit, to draw to it the attention of the
public also.  I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, CHAS. EDW. GREY.

           SKETCH OF THE LIFE of HORACE WALPOLE, EARL OF ORFORD:
                            BY LORD DOVER. (20)


Any one who attempts to become a biographer of Horace Walpole
must labour under the disadvantage of following a greater master
in the art; namely, Sir Walter Scott, whose lively and agreeable
account of this Author, contained in his "Lives of the
Novelists," is well known and deservedly admired.  As, however,
the greater part of Walter Scott's pages is devoted to a very
able criticism of the only work of fiction produced by Walpole,
"The Castle of Otranto," it has been thought, that a more general
sketch of his life and writings might not prove unacceptable to
the reader.

Horace Walpole was the third and youngest son (21) of that
eminent minister, Sir Robert Walpole-the glory of the Whigs, the
preserver of the throne of these realms to the present Royal
Family, and under whose fostering rule and guidance the country
flourished in peace for more than twenty years.  The elder
brothers of Horace were, Robert, Lord Walpole, so created in
1723, who succeeded his father in the Earldom of Orford in 1745,
and died in 1751; and Sir Edward Walpole, Knight of the Bath,
whose three natural daughters were, Mrs. Keppel, wife to the
Honourable Frederick Keppel, Bishop of Exeter; the Countess of
Waldegrave, afterwards Duchess of Gloucester; and the Countess of
Dysart.  Sir Edward Walpole died in 1784.  His sisters were,
Catherine, who died of consumption at the age of nineteen; and
Mary, married to George, Viscount Malpas, afterwards third Earl
of Cholmondeley: she died in 1732.  The mother of Horace, and of
his brothers and sisters here mentioned, was Catherine Shorter,
daughter of John Shorter, Esq. of Bybrook, in Kent, and grand-
daughter of Sir John Shorter, Lord Mayor of London in 1688. (22)
She died in 1736; and her youngest son, who always professed the
greatest veneration for her memory, erected a monument to her in
Westminster Abbey, in one of the side aisles of Henry the
Seventh's Chapel.  Horace Walpole had also a half-sister, the
natural daughter of his father, by his mistress, Maria Skerrett,
whom he afterwards married.  She also was named Mary Walpole, and
married Colonel Charles Churchill, the natural son of General
Churchill; who was himself a natural son of an older brother of
the great Duke of Marlborough.

Horace Walpole was born October 5th, 1717 (23) and educated a
Eton School, and at King's College, Cambridge.  Upon leaving the
latter place, he set out on his travels on the Continent, in
company with Gray the poet, with whom he had formed a friendship
at school.  They commenced their journey in March 1739, and
continued abroad above two years.  Almost the whole of this time
was spent in Italy, and nearly a year of it was devoted to
Florence; where Walpole was detained by the society of his
friends, Mr. Mann, Mr. Chute, and Mr. Whithed.  It was in these
classic scenes, that his love of art, and taste for elegant and
antiquarian literature, became more developed; and that it took
such complete possession of him as to occupy the whole of his
later life, diversified only by the occasional amusement of
politics, or the distractions of society. Unfortunately, the
friendship of Walpole and his travelling companion could not
survive two years of constant intercourse: they quarrelled and
parted at Reggio, in July 1741, and afterwards pursued their way
homewards by different routes. (24)

Walpole arrived in England in September 1741, at which time his
correspondence with Sir Horace Mann commences.  He had been
chosen member for Callington, in the parliament which was elected
in June of that year, and arrived in the House of Commons just in
time to witness the angry discussions which preceded and
accompanied the downfall of his father's administration.  He
plunged at once into the excitement of political partisanship
with all the ardour of youth, and all the zeal which his filial
affection for his father inspired.  His feelings at this period
are best explained by a reference to his letters in the following
collection.  Public business and attendance upon the House of
Commons, apart from the interest attached to peculiar questions,
he seems never to have liked.  He consequently took very little
part either in debates or committees.  In March 1742, on a motion
being made for an inquiry into the conduct of Sir Robert Walpole
for the preceding ten years, he delivered his maiden speech; (25)
on which he was complimented by no less a judge of oratory than
Pitt.  This speech he has preserved in his letter to Sir Horace
Mann, of March 24th, 1742.  He moved the Address in 1751; and in
1756 made a speech on the question of employing Swiss regiments
in the colonies.  This speech he has also himself preserved in
the second volume of his "Memoires."  In 1757 he was active in
his endeavours to save the unfortunate Admiral Byng.  Of his
conduct upon this occasion he has left a detailed account of his
"Memoires."  This concludes all that can be collected of his
public life, and at the general election of 1768 (26) he finally
retired from parliament.

Upon this occasion he writes thus to George Montagu,-" As my
senatorial dignity is gone, I shall not put you to the expense of
a cover; and I hope the advertisement will not be taxed, as I
seal it to the paper.  In short, I retain so much iniquity from
the last infamous parliament, that, you see, I would still cheat
the public.  The comfort I feel in sitting peaceably here,
instead of being at Lynn, in the high fever of a contested
election, which, at best, Would end in my being carried about
that large town, like a figure of a pope at a bonfires is very
great.  I do not think, when that function is over, that I shall
repent my resolution.  What could I see but sons and grandsons
playing over the same knaveries that I have seen their fathers
and grandfather's act? Could I hear oratory beyond my Lord
Chatham's?  Will there ever be parts equal to Charles Towns@ends?
Will George Grenville cease to be the most tiresome of beings?"
(27)

>From this time Walpole devoted himself more than ever to his
literary and antiquarian pursuits; though the interest he still,
in society at least, took in politics, is obvious, from the
frequent reference to the subject in his letters.

In the course of his life, his political opinions appear to have
undergone a great change.  In his youth, and indeed till his old
age, he was not only a strenuous Whig, but, at times, almost a
Republican.  How strong his opinions were in this sense may be
gathered, both from the frequent confessions of his political
faith, which occur in his letters, and from his reverence for the
death-warrant of Charles the First, of which he hung up the
engraving in his bed-room, and wrote upon it with his own hand
the words "Major Charta."  The horrors of the French Revolution
drove him, in the latter period of his life, into other views of
politics; and he seems to have become, in theory at least, a
Tory, though he probably would have indignantly repudiated the
appellation, had it been applied to him.

Even during the earlier part of his career, his politics had
varied a good deal (as, indeed, in a long life, whose do not?);
but, in his case, the cause of variation was a most amiable one.
His devoted attachment to Marshal Conway, which led him, when
that distinguished man was turned out of his command of a
regiment, and of his place at court, in 1764, (28) to offer, with
much earnestness, to divide his fortune with him caused him also
to look with a favourable eye upon the government of the day,
whenever Mr. Conway was employed, and to follow him implicitly in
his votes in the House of Commons.  Upon this subject he writes
thus to Conway, who had not told him beforehand of a speech he
made on the Qualification Bill, in consequence of which Walpole
was absent from the House of Commons upon that occasion--"I don't
suspect you of any reserve to me; I only mention it now for an
occasion Of telling YOU, that I don't like to have any body think
that I would not do whatever you do.  I am of no consequence;
but, at least, it would give me some to act invariably with you,
and that I shall most certainly be ever ready to do." (29)  Upon
another occasion he writes again in a similar strain:-"My only
reason for writing is, to repeat to you, that whatever you do, I
shall act with you.  I resent any thing done to you as to myself.
My fortunes shall never be separated from yours, except that,
some day or other, I hope yours will be great, and I am content
with mine." (30)

Upon one political point Horace Walpole appears to have
entertained from the first the most just views, and even at a
time when such were not sanctioned by the general opinion of the
nation.  From its very commencement, he objected to that
disastrous contest the American war, which, commenced in ignorant
and presumptuous folly, was prolonged to gratify the wicked
obstinacy of individuals, and ended, as Walpole had foretold it
would, in the discomfiture of its authors, and the national
disgrace and degradation, after a profuse and useless waste of
blood and treasure.  Nor must his sentiments upon the Slave Trade
be forgotten-sentiments which he held, too, in an age when, far
different from the present one, the Assiento Treaty, and other
horrors of the same kind, were deemed, not only justifiable, but
praiseworthy.  "We have been sitting," he writes, on the 25th of
February 1750, "this fortnight on the African Company.  We, the
British Senate, that temple of Liberty, and bulwark of Protestant
Christianity, have, this fortnight, been considering methods to
make more effectual that horrid traffic of selling negroes.  It
has appeared to us, that six-and-forty thousand of these wretches
are sold every year to our plantations alone! It chills one's
blood-I would not have to say I voted for it, for the continent
of America!  The destruction of the miserable inhabitants by the
Spaniards was but a momentary misfortune that flowed from the
discovery of the New World, compared to this lasting havoc which
it brought upon Africa.  We reproach Spain, and yet do not even
pretend the nonsense of butchering the poor creatures for the
good of their souls." (31)

One of the most favourite pursuits of Walpole was the building
and decoration of his Gothic villa of Strawberry Hill.  It is
situated at the end of the village of Twickenham, towards
Teddington, on a slope, which gives it a fine view of the reach
of the Thames and the opposite wooded hill of Richmond Park.  He
bought it in 1747, of Mrs. Chenevix, the proprietress of a
celebrated toy-shop.  He thus describes it in a letter of that
year to Mr. Conway.  "You perceive by my date that I am got into
a new camp, and have left my tub at Windsor.  It is a little
plaything-house that I got out of Mrs. Chenevix's shop, and is
the prettiest bauble you ever saw.  It is set in enamelled
meadows, with filigree hedges:-

'A small Euphrates through the piece is roll'd,
And little finches wave their wings of gold.'

Two delightful roads, that you would call dusty, supply me
continually with coaches and chaises; barges, as solemn as barons
of the exchequer, move under my window; Richmond Hill and Ham
Walks bound my prospects; but, thank God! the Thames is between
me and the Duchess of Queensberry. (32) Dowagers, as plenty as
flounders, inhabit all around; and Pope's ghost is just now
skimming under my window by a most poetical moonlight." (33)

He commenced almost immediately adding to the house, and
Gothicizing it, assisted by the taste and designs of his friend
Mr. Bentley; till, in the end, the cottage of Mrs. Chenevix had
increased into the castellated residence we now behold.  He also
filled it with collections of various sorts-books, prints,
pictures, portraits, enamels, and miniatures, antiquities, and
curiosities of all kinds.  Among these miscellaneous hoards are
to be found some fine works of art, and many things most valuable
in an historical and antiquarian point of view.  For these
various expenses he drew upon his annual income, which arose from
three patent places conferred on him by his father, of which the
designations were, Usher of the Exchequer, Comptroller of the
Pipe, and Clerk of the Estreats.  As early as the year 1744,
these sinecures produced to him, according to his own account,
nearly two thousand a-year; and somewhat later, the one place of
Usher of Exchequer rose in value to double this sum.  This
income, with prudent management, sufficed for the gratification
of his expensive tastes of building and collecting, to which his
long life was devoted.

With regard to the merits of Strawberry Hill, as a building, it
is perhaps unfair, in the present age, when the principles of
Gothic architecture have been so much studied, and so often put
in practice, to criticise it too severely.  Walpole himself, who,
in the earlier part of his life, seems to have had an unbounded
admiration for the works of his own hands, appears in later times
to have been aware of the faults in style of which he had been
guilty; for, in a letter to Mr. Barrett, in 1788, he says, "If
Mr. Matthews was really entertained" (with seeing Strawberry
Hill), "I am glad.  But Mr. Wyatt has made him too correct a Goth
not to have seen all the imperfections and bad execution of my
attempts; for neither Mr. Bentley nor my workmen had studied the
science, and I was always too desultory and impatient to consider
that I should please myself more by allowing time, than by
hurrying my plans into execution before they were ripe.  My
house, therefore, is but a sketch for beginners; yours (34) is
finished by a great master; and if Mr. Matthews liked mine, it
was en virtuose, who loves the dawnings of an art, or the
glimmerings of its restoration." (35)

In fact, the building of Strawberry Hill was "the glimmering of
the restoration" of gothic architecture, which had previously,
for above a century, been so much neglected that its very
principles seemed lost.  If we compare the Gothic of Strawberry
Hill with that of buildings about the same period, or a little
anterior to it, we shall see how vastly superior it is to them,
both in its taste and its decorations.  If we look at some of the
restorations of our churches of the beginning of the eighteenth
century , we shall find them a most barbarous mixture of Gothic
forms and Grecian and Roman ornaments.  Such are the western
towers of Westminster Abbey, designed by Wren; the attempts at
Gothic, by the same architect, in one or two of his City
churches; Gibbs's quadrangle of All Souls' College, Oxford; and
the buildings in the same style of Kent, Batty, Langley, etc.  To
these Strawberry is greatly superior: and it must be observed,
that Walpole himself, in his progressive building, went on
improving and purifying his taste.  Thus the gallery and
round-tower at Strawberry Hill, which were among his latest
works, are incomparably the best part of the house; and in their
interior decorations there is very little to be objected to, and
much to be admired.

It were to be wished, indeed, that Walpole's haste to finish, to
which he alludes in the letter just quoted, and perhaps also, in
some degree, economy, had not made him build his castle, which,
with all its faults, is a curious relic of a clever and ingenious
man, with so little solidity, that it is almost already in a
state of decay.  Lath and plaster, and wood, appear to have been
his favourite materials for construction; which made his friend
Williams (36) say of him, towards the end of his life, "that he
had outlived three sets of his own battlements."  It is somewhat
curious, as a proof of the inconsistency of the human mind, that,
having built his castle with so little view to durability,
Walpole entailed the perishable possession with a degree of
strictness, which would have been more fitting for a baronial
estate.  And that, too, after having written a fable entitled
"The Entail," in consequence, of some one having asked him
whether he did not intend to entail Strawberry Hill, and in
ridicule of such a proceeding.

Whether Horace Walpole conferred a benefit upon the public by
setting the fashion of applying the Gothic style of architecture
to domestic purposes, may be doubtful; so greatly has the example
he gave been abused in practice since.  But, at all events, he
thus led the professors of architecture to study with accuracy
the principles of the art, which has occasioned the restoration
and preservation in such an admirable manner of so many of our
finest cathedrals. colleges, and ancient Gothic and conventual
buildings.  This, it must be at least allowed, was the fortunate
result of the rage for Gothic, which succeeded the building of
Strawberry Hill.  For a good many years after that event, every
new building was pinnacled and turreted on all sides, however
little its situation, its size, or its uses might seem to fit it
for such ornaments.  Then, as fashion is never constant for any
great length of' time, the taste of the public rushed at once
upon castles; and loopholes, and battlements, and heavy arches,
and buttresses appeared in every direction.  Now the fancy of the
time has turned as madly to that bastard kind of architecture,
possessing, however, many beauties, which compounded of the
Gothic, Castellated, and Grecian or Roman, is called the
Elizabethan, or Old English.  No villa, no country-house, no
lodge in the outskirts of London, no box of a retired tradesman
is now built, except in some modification of this style.  The
most ludicrous situations and the most inappropriate destinations
do not deter any one from pointing his gables, and squaring his
bay-windows, in the most approved Elizabethan manner.  And this
vulgarizing and lowering Of the Old English architecture, by over
use, is sure, sooner or later, to lose its popularity, and to
cause it to be contemned and neglected, like its predecessors.
All these different styles, if properly applied, have their
peculiar merits.  In old English country-houses, which have
formerly been conventual buildings, the gothic style may be, with
great propriety, introduced.  On the height of Belvoir or in
similar situations, nothing could be devised so appropriate as
the castellated; and in additions to, or renovations of old
manor-houses the Elizabethan may be, with equal advantage,
adopted.  It is the injudicious application of all three which
has been, and is sure to be, the occasion of their fall in public
favour.

The next pursuit of Walpole, to -which it now becomes desirable
to advert, are his literary labours, and the various publications
with which, at different periods of his life, he favoured the
world.  His first effort appears to have been a copy of verses,
written at Cambridge.  His poetry is generally not of a very high
order; lively, and with happy turns and expressions, but injured
frequently by a sort of quaintness, and a somewhat inharmonious
rhythm.  Its merits, however, exactly fitted it for the purpose
which it was for the most part intended for; namely, as what are
called vers de soci`et`e."  (37) Among the best of his verses may
be mentioned those "On the neglected Column in the Place of St.
Mark, at Florence," which contains some fine lines; his
"Twickenham Register;" and "The Three Vernons."

In 1752 he published his "Edes Walpolianae," or description of
the family seat' of Houghton Hall, in Norfolk, where his father
had built a palace, and had made a fine collection of pictures,
which were sold by his grandson George, third Earl of Orford, to
the Empress Catherine of Russia.  This work, which is, in fact, a
mere catalogue of pictures, first showed the peculiar talent of
Horace Walpole for enlivening, by anecdote and lightness of
style, a dry subject.  This was afterwards still more exemplified
in his "Anecdotes of Painting in England," of which the different
volumes were published in 1761, 1763, and 1771; and in the
"Catalogue of Engravers," published in 1763.  These works were
compiled from papers of Vertue, the engraver; but Walpole, from
the stores of his own historical knowledge, from his taste in the
fine arts, and his happy manner of sketching characters, rendered
them peculiarly his own.  But his masterpiece in this line was
his "Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors," originally published
in 1758. It is very true, as Walter Scott observes, that "it
would be difficult, by any process or principle of subdivision,
to select a list of so many plebeian authors, containing so very
few whose genius was worthy of commemoration." (38)  But this
very circumstance renders the merit of Walpole the greater, in
having, out of such materials, composed a work which must be read
with amusement and interest, as long as liveliness of diction and
felicity in anecdote are considered ingredients of amusement in
literature.

In 1757 Walpole established a private printing-press at
Strawberry Hill, and the first work he printed at it was the Odes
of Gray, with Bentley's prints and vignettes.  Among the
handsomest and most valuable volumes which subsequently issued
from this press, in addition to Walpole's own Anecdotes of
Painting, and his description of Strawberry Hill, must be
mentioned the quarto lucan, with the notes of Grotius and
Bentley; the Life of Lord Herbert of Cherbury by himself,
flentzner's Travels, and Lord Whitworth's account of Russia.  Of
all these he printed a very limited number.  It does not,
however, appear, as stated in the Biographical Dictionary, (39)
he reserved all the copies as presents; on the contrary, it would
seem that in most instances he sold a certain portion of the
copies to the booksellers, probably with a view of defraying the
expenses of his printing establishment.  As, however, the supply
in the book-market of the Strawberry Hill editions was very
small, they generally sold for high prices, and a great interest
was created respecting them.

In 1764 Walpole published one of the most remarkable of his
works, "The Castle of Otranto;" and in 1768 his still more
remarkable production, "The Mysterious Mother." (40) In speaking
of the latter effort of his genius, (for it undoubtedly deserves
that appellation,) an admirable judge of literary excellence has
made the following remarks; "It is the fashion to underrate
Horace Walpole firstly, because he was a nobleman, and secondly,
because he was a gentleman: but, to say nothing of the
composition of his incomparable letters, and of "The Castle of
Otranto," he is the Ultimus Romanorum, the author of the
'Mysterious Mother,' a tragedy of the highest order, and not a
puling love-play: he is the father of the first romance, and of
the last tragedy in our language, and surely worthy of a higher
place than any living author, be he who he may." (41)

In speaking Of "The Castle of Otranto," it may be remarked as a
singular coincidence in the life of Walpole, that as he had been
the first person to lead the modern public to seek for their
architecture in the Gothic style and age, so he also opened the
great magazine of the tales of Gothic times to their literature.
"The Castle of Otranto" is remarkable," observes an eminent
critic, "not only for the wild interest of its story, but as the
first modern attempt to found a tale of amusing fiction upon the
basis of the ancient romances of chivalry." (42) "This romance,"
he continues, "has been justly considered not only as the
original and model of a peculiar species of composition,
attempted and successfully executed by a man of great genius, but
as one of the standard works of our literature.' (43)

The account which Walpole himself gives of the circumstances
which led to the composition of "The Castle of Otranto," of his
fancy of the portrait of Lord Deputy Falkland, in the gallery at
Strawberry Hill, walking Out of its frame; and of his dream of a
gigantic hand in armour on the banister of a great staircase, are
well known.  Perhaps it may be objected to him, that he makes too
frequent use of supernatural machinery in his romance; but, at
the time it was written, this portion of his work was peculiarly
acceptable to the public.  We have since, from the labours of the
immense tribe of his followers and imitators of different degrees
of merit, "supped so full of horrors," that we are become more
fastidious upon these points; and even, perhaps, unfairly so, as
at the present moment the style of supernatural romances in
general is rather fallen again Into neglect and disfavour. "If,"
concludes Walter Scott, in his criticism on this work, (and the
sentiments expressed by him are so fair and just, that it is
impossible to forbear quoting them,) "Horace Walpole, who led the
way in this new species of literary composition, has been
surpassed by some of his followers in diffuse brilliancy of
composition, and perhaps in the art of detaining the mind of the
reader in a state of feverish and anxious suspense through a
protracted and complicated narrative, more will yet remain with
him than the single merit of originality and invention.  The
applause due to chastity of style--to a happy combination of
supernatural agency with human interest-to a tone of feudal
manners and language, sustained by characters strongly marked and
well discriminated,-and to unity of action, producing scenes
alternately of interest and grandeur,-the applause, in fine,
which cannot be denied to him who can excite the passions of fear
and pity must be awarded to the author of the Castle of Otranto."
(44)

"The Mysterious Mother," is a production of higher talent and
more powerful genius than any other which we owe to the pen of
Horace Walpole; though, from the nature of its subject, and the
sternness of its character, it is never likely to compete in
popularity with many of his other writings.  The story is too
horrible almost for tragedy.  It is, as Walpole himself
observes,"more truly horrid even than that of Oedipus." He took
it from a history which had been told him, and which he thus
relates: "I had heard, when very Young, that a gentlewoman, under
uncommon agonies of mind, had waited on Archbishop Tillotson, and
besought his counsel.  Many years before, a damsel that served
her, had acquainted her that she was importuned by the
gentlewoman's son to grant him a private meeting.  The mother
ordered the maiden to make the assignation, when, she said, she
would discover herself, and reprimand him for his criminal
passion: but, being hurried away by a much more criminal passion
herself, she kept the assignation without discovering herself.
The fruit of this horrid artifice was a daughter, whom the
gentlewoman caused to be educated very privately in the country:
but proving very lovely, and being accidentally met by her
father-brother, who had never had the slightest suspicion of the
truth, he had fallen in love with and actually married her.  The
wretched, guilty mother, learning what had happened, and
distracted with the consequence of her crime, had now resorted to
the archbishop, to know in what manner she should act.  The
prelate charged her never to let her son or daughter know what
had passed, as they were innocent of any criminal intention.  For
herself he bade her almost despair." (45) Afterwards, Walpole
found out that a similar story existed in the Tales of the Queen
of Navarre, and also in Bishop Hall's works.  In this tragedy the
dreadful interest is well sustained throughout, the march of the
blank verse is grand and imposing, and some of the scenes are
worked up with a vigour and a pathos, which render it one of the
most powerful dramatic efforts of which our language can boast.

The next publication of Walpole, was his "Historic Doubts on the
Life and Reign of King Richard the Third," one of the most
ingenious historical and antiquarian dissertations which has ever
issued from the press.  He has collected his facts with so much
industry, and draws his arguments and inferences from them with
so much ability, that if he has not convinced the public of the
entire innocence of Richard, he has, at all events, diminished
the number of his crimes, and has thrown a doubt over his whole
history, as well as over the credibility of his accusers, which
is generally favourable to his reputation.  This work occasioned
a great sensation in the literary world, and produced several
replies, from F. Guydickens, Esq., Dean Milles, and the Rev. Mr.
Masters, and others.  These works, however, are now gathered to
"the dull of ancient days;" while the book they were intended to
expose and annihilate remains an instructive and amusing volume;
and, to say the least of it, a most creditable monument of its
author's ingenuity.

The remainder of the works of Walpole, published or printed in
his lifetime, consist of minor, or, as he calls them, Fugitive
pieces."  Of these the most remarkable are his papers in "The
World," and other periodicals; " A Letter from Xo Ho, a Chinese
Philosopher, in London," on the politics of the day; the "Essay
on Modern Gardening;" the pamphlet called "A Counter Address," on
the dismissal of Marshal Conway from his command of a regiment;
the fanciful, but lively "Hieroglyphic Tales;" and "The
Reminiscences," or Recollections of Court and Political
Anecdotes; which last he wrote for the amusement of the Miss
Berrys.  All of these are marked with those peculiarities, and
those graces of style, which belonged to him; and may still be
read, however various their subjects, with interest and
instruction.  The Reminiscences are peculiarly curious; and may,
perhaps, be stated to be, both in manner and matter, the very
perfection of anecdote writing.  We may, indeed, say, with
respect to Walpole, what can be advanced of but few such
voluminous authors, that it is impossible to open any part of his
works without deriving entertainment from them; so much do the
charms and liveliness of his manner of writing influence all the
subjects he treats of.

Since the death of Walpole, a portion of his political Memoires,
comprising the History of the last ten years of the Reign of
George the Second, has been published, and has made a very
remarkable addition to the historical information of that period.
At the same time it must be allowed, that this work has not
entirely fulfilled the expectation which the public had formed of
it.  Though full of curious and interesting details; it can
hardly be said to form a very interesting whole; while in no
other of the publications of the author do his prejudices and
aversions appear in so strong and unreasonable a light.  His
satire also, and we might even call it by the stronger name of
abuse, is too general, and thereby loses its effect.  Many of the
characters are probably not too severely drawn; but some
evidently are, and this circumstance shakes our faith in the
rest.  We must, however, remember that the age he describes was
one of peculiar corruption; and when the virtue and character of
public men were, perhaps, at a lower ebb than at any other period
since the days of Charles the Second.  The admirably graphic
style of Walpole, in describing particular scenes and moments,
shines forth in many parts of the Memoires: and this, joined to
his having been an actor in many of the circumstances he relates
and a near spectator of all, must ever render his book one of
extreme value to the politician and the historian.

But, the posthumous works of Walpole, upon which his lasting fame
with posterity will probably rest, are his "incomparable
LETTERS." (46) Of these, a considerable portion was published in
the quarto edition of his works in 1798: since which period two
quarto volumes, containing his letters to George Montagu, Esq.
and the Rev. William Cole; and another, containing those to Lord
Hertford and the Rev. Henry Zouch, have been given to the world;
and the present publication of his correspondence with Sir Horace
Mann completes the series, which extends from the year 1735 to
the commencement of 1797, within six weeks of his death-a period
of no less than fifty-seven years.

A friend of Mr. Walpole's has observed, that "his epistolary
talents have shown our language to be capable of all the grace
and all the charms of the French of Madame de S`evign`e;" (47)
and the remark is a true one, for he is undoubtedly the author
who first proved the aptitude of our language for that light and
gay epistolary style, which was before supposed peculiarly to
belong to our Gallic neighbours.  There may be letters of a
higher order in our literature than those of Walpole.  Gray's
letters, and perhaps Cowper's, may be taken as instances of this;
but where shall we find such an union of taste, humour, and
almost dramatic power of description and narrative, as in the
correspondence of Walpole? Where such happy touches upon the
manners and characters of the time?  Where can we find such
graphic scenes, as the funeral of George the Second; as the party
to Vauxhall with Lady Harrington; as the ball at Miss
Chudleigh's, in the letters already published; or as some of the
House of Commons' debates and many of the anecdotes of society in
those now offered to the world?  Walpole's style in
letter-writing is occasionally quaint, and sometimes a little
laboured; but for the most part he has contrived to throw into it
a great appearance of ease, as if he wrote rapidly and without
premeditation.  This, however, was by no means the case, as he
took great pains with his letters, and even collected, and wrote
down beforehand, anecdotes, with a view to their subsequent
insertion.  Some of these stores have been discovered among the
papers at Strawberry Hill.
The account of the letters of Walpole leads naturally to some
mention of his friends, to whom they were addressed.  These were,
Gray the poet, Marshal Conway, his elder brother, Lord Hertford,
George Montagu, Esq., the Rev. William Cole, Lord Strafford,
Richard Bentley, Esq., John Chute, Esq., Sir Horace Mann, Lady
Hervey, and in after-life, Mrs. Hannah More, Mrs. Damer, and the
two Miss Berrys.  His correspondence with the three latter ladies
has never been published; but his regard for them, and intimacy
with them, are known to have been very great.  Towards Mrs.
Damer, the only child of the friend of his heart, Marshal Conway,
he had an hereditary feeling of affection; and to her he
bequeathed Strawberry Hill.  To the Miss Berrys he left, in
conjunction with their father, the greater part of his papers,
and the charge of collecting and publishing his works, a task
which they performed with great care and judgment.  To these
friends must be added the name of Richard West, Esq., a young man
of great promise, (only son of Richard West, Lord Chancellor of
Ireland, by the daughter of Bishop Burnet,) who died in 1742, at
the premature age of twenty-six.

Gray had been a school friend of Walpole, as has been before
mentioned, they travelled together, and quarrelled during the
Journey.  Walter Scott suggests as a reason for their
differences, "that the youthful vivacity, and perhaps
aristocratic assumption, of Walpole, did not agree with the
somewhat formal opinions and habits of the professed man of
letters." (48) This conjecture may very possibly be the correct
one; but we have no clue to guide us with certainty to the causes
of their rupture.  In after-life they were reconciled, though the
intimacy of early friendship never appears to have been restored
between them.  (49) Scott says of Walpole, that , his temper was
precarious;" and we may, perhaps, affirm the same of Gray.  At
all events, they were persons of such different characters, that
their not agreeing could not be surprising.  What could be more
opposite than "the self-sequestered, melancholy Gray," and the
eager, volatile Walpole, of whom Lady Townshend said, when some
one talked of his good spirits, "Oh, Mr. Walpole is spirits of
hartshorn."  When Mason was writing the life of Gray, Walpole
bade him throw the whole blame of the quarrel upon him.  This
might be mere magnanimity, as Gray was then dead; what makes one
most inclined to think it was the truth, is the fact, that Gray
was not the only intimate friend of Walpole with whom he
quarrelled.  He did so with Bentley, for which the eccentric
conduct of that man of talent might perhaps account.  But what
shall we say to his quarrel with the good-humoured, laughing
George Montagu, with whom for the last years of the life of the
latter, he held no intercourse?  It is true, that in a letter to
Mr. Cole, Walpole lays the blame upon Montagu, and says, "he was
become such an humourist;" but it must be remembered that we do
not know Montagu's version of the story; and that undoubtedly
three quarrels with three intimate friends rather support the
charge, brought by Scott against Walpole, of his having "a
precarious temper."

The friendship, however, which does honour both to the head and
heart of Horace Walpole, was that which he bore to Marshal
Conway; a man who, accordant to all the accounts of him that have
come down to us, was so truly worthy of inspiring such a degree
of affection.  Burke's panegyric (50)upon his public character
and conduct is well-known; while the Editor of Lord Orford's
Works thus most justly eulogizes his private life. "It is only
those who have had the opportunity of penetrating into the most
secret motives of his public conduct and the inmost recesses of
his private life, that can do real justice to the unsullied
purity of his character-who saw and knew him in the evening of
his days, retired from the honourable activity of a soldier and a
statesman, to the calm enjoyments of private life, happy in the
resources of his own mind, and in the cultivation of useful
science, in the bosom of domestic peace-unenriched by pensions or
places, undistinguished by titles or ribands, unsophisticated  by
public life, and unwearied by retirement." The offer of Walpole
to share his fortune with Conway, when the latter was dismissed
from his places, an offer so creditable to both parties, has been
already mentioned; and if we wish to have a just idea of the
esteem in which Marshal Conway was held by his contemporaries, it
is only necessary to mention, that upon the same occasion,
similar offers were pressed upon him by his brother Lord
Hertford, and by the Duke of Devonshire, without any concert
between them.


The rest of' Walpole's friends and correspondents it is hardly
necessary to dwell upon; they are many of them already well known
to the public from various causes. it may, however, be permitted
to observe, that, they were, for the most part, persons
distinguished either by their taste in the fine arts, their love
of antiquities, their literary attainments, or their
conversational talents.  To the friends already mentioned, but
with whom Walpole did not habitually correspond, must be added,
Mason the poet, George Selwyn, Richard second Lord Edgecumbe,
George James Williams, Esq.  Lady Suffolk, and Mrs. Clive the
actress.

With the Marquise du Deffand, the old, blind, but clever leader
of French society, he became acquainted at Paris late in her
life.  Her devotion for him appears to have been very great, and
is sometimes expressed in her letters with a warmth and
tenderness, which Walpole, who was most sensitive of ridicule,
thought so absurd in a person of her years and infirmities, that
he frequently reproves her very harshly for it; so much so, as to
give him the appearance of a want of kindly feeling towards her,
which his general conduct to her, and the regrets he expressed on
her death, do not warrant us in accusing him of. (51)

In concluding the literary part of the character of Walpole, it
is natural to allude to the transactions which took place between
him and the unfortunate Chatterton; a text upon which so much
calumny and misrepresentation have been embroidered.  The
periodicals of the day, and the tribe of those "who daily
scribble for their daily bread," and for whom Walpole had,
perhaps unwisely, frequently expressed his contempt, attacked him
bitterly for his inhumanity to genius, and even accused him as
the author of the subsequent misfortunes and untimely death of
that misguided son of genius; nay, even the author of "The
Pursuits of Literature," who wrote many years after the
transaction had taken place, and who ought to have known better,
gave in to the prevailing topic of abuse. (52) It therefore
becomes necessary to state shortly what really took place upon
this occasion, a task which is rendered easier by the clear view
of the transaction taken both by Walter Scott in his "Lives of
the Novelists," and by Chalmers in his "Biographical Dictionary,"
which is also fully borne out by the narrative drawn up by
Walpole himself, and accompanied by the correspondence.

it appears then, that in March
 1769, Walpole-received a letter from Chatterton, enclosing a few
specimens of the pretended poems of Rowley, and announcing his
discovery of a series of ancient painters at Bristol.  To this
communication Walpole, naturally enough, returned a very civil
answer.  Shortly afterwards, doubts arose in his mind as to the
authenticity of the poems; these were confirmed by the opinions
of some friends, to whom he showed them; and he then wrote an
expression of these doubts to Chatterton.  This appears to have
excited the anger of Chatterton, who, after one or two short
notes, wrote Walpole a very impertinent one, in which he
redemanded his manuscripts.  This last letter Walpole had
intended to have answered with some sharpness; but did not do so.
He only returned the specimens on the 4th of August 1769; and
this concluded the intercourse between them, and as Walpole
observes, "I never saw him then, before, or since."  Subsequently
to this transaction, Chatterton acquired other patrons more
credulous than Walpole, and proceeded with his forgeries.  In
April 1770 he came to London, and committed suicide in August of
that year; a fate which befell him, it is to be feared, more in
consequence of his own dissolute and profligate habits, than from
any want of patronage.  However this may be, Walpole clearly had
nothing to say to it.

In addition to the accusation of crushing, instead of fostering
his genius, Walpole has also been charged with cruelty in not
assisting him with money.  Upon this, he very truly says himself,
"Chatterton was neither indigent nor distressed, at the time of
his correspondence with me.  He was maintained by his mother and
lived with a lawyer.  His only pleas to my assistance were,
disgust to his profession, inclination to poetry, and
communication of some suspicious MSS.  His distress was the
consequence of quitting his master, and coming to London, and of
his other extravagances.  He had depended on the impulse of the
talents he felt for making impression, and lifting him to wealth,
honours, and faine.  I have already said, that I should have been
blamable to his mother and society, if I had seduced an
apprentice from his master to marry him to the nine Muses;' and I
should have encouraged a propensity to forgery, which is not the
talent most wanting culture in the present age." (53) Such and so
unimportant was the transaction with Chatterton, which brought so
much obloquy on Walpole, and seems really to have given him at
different times great annoyance.

There remains but little more to relate in the life of Walpole.
His old age glided on peacefully, and, with the exception of his
severe sufferings from the gout, apparently contentedly, in the
pursuit of his favourite studies and employments.  In the year
1791, he succeeded his unhappy nephew, George, third Earl of
Orford, who had at different periods of his life been insane, in
the family estate and the earldom.  The accession of this latter
dignity seems rather to have annoyed him than otherwise.  He
never took his seat in the House of Lords, and his unwillingness
to adopt his title was shown in his endeavours to avoid making
use of it in his signature.  He not unfrequently signed himself,
"The Uncle of the late Earl of Orford." (54)

He retained his faculties to the last, but his limbs became
helpless from his frequent attacks of gout: as he himself
expresses it,

"Fortune, who scatters her gifts out of season,
Though unkind to my limbs, has yet left me my reason." (55)

As a friend of his, who only knew him in the last years of his
life, speaks of "his conversation as singularly brilliant as it
was original," (56) we may conclude his liveliness never deserted
him; that his talent for letter-writing did not, we have a proof
in a letter written only six weeks before his death, in which,
with all his accustomed grace of manner he entreats a lady of his
acquaintance not to show "the idle notes of her ancient
servant."-Lord Orford died in the eightieth year `of his life, at
his house in Berkeley Square, on the 2d of March 1797, and was
buried with his family in the church at Houghton and with him
concluded the male line of the descendants of Sir Robert Walpole.

(20) Originally prefixed to his lordship's edition of Walpole's
Letters to Sir Horace Mann, first published in 1833.

(21) In a MS. note by Walpole, in his own copy of collins's
Peerage, it is stated, that Sir Robert Walpole had, by his first
wife, "another son, William, who died young, and a daughter,
Catherine, who died of a consumption at Bath, aged nineteen."-E.

(22) The occasion of the death of sir John Shorter was a curious
one.  It is thus related in the Ellis Correspondence:-"Sir John
Shorter, the present Lord Mayor. is very ill with a fall off his
horse, under Newgate, as he was going to proclaim Bartholomew
Fair.  The city custom is, it seems, to drink always under
Newgate when the Lord Mayor passes that way; and at this time the
Lord Mayor's horse, being somewhat skittish,-started at the sight
of the large glittering tankard which was reached to his
lordship."  Letter of Aug. 30th, 1688.

"On Tuesday last died the Lord Mayor, Sir John Shorter: the
occasion of his distemper was his fall under Newgate, which
bruised him a little, and put him into a fever."  Letter of
September 6th, 1688.

(23 )birthdate)  In Chalmers's Biographical Dictionary it is
stated, that Horace Walpole was born in 1718; and Sir Walter
Scott says he was born in 1716-17, which, according to the New
Style, would mean that he was born in one of the three first
months of the year 1717.  Both these statements are, however,
erroneous, as he himself fixes the day of his birth, in a letter
to Mr. Conway, dated October 5th, 1764, where he says "What
signifies what happens when one is seven-and-forty, as I am
to-day?  They tell me 'tis my birthday," And again, in a letter
to the same correspondent, dated October 5th, 1777, he says, "I
am three-score to-day."

(24) The exact cause of this quarrel," says Mr. Mitford, in his
Life of Gray, " has been passed over by the delicacy of his
biographer, because Horace Walpole was alive when the Memoirs of
Gray were written.  The former, however, charged himself with the
chief blame, and lamented that he had not paid more attention and
deference to Gray's superior judgment and prudence." See Works of
Gray, vol. i. p. 9, Pickering's edition 1836.  In the
"Walpolianae" is the following passage:-"The quarrel between Gray
and me arose from his being too serious a companion.  I had just
broke loose from the restraints of the University with as much
money as I could spend, and I was willing to indulge myself.
Gray was for antiquities, etc. while I was for perpetual balls
and plays: the fault was mine."-E.

(25) Sir Walter Scott says that Walpole, on one occasion, "
vindicated the memory of his father with great dignity and
eloquence" in the House of Commons; but, as I cannot find any
trace of a speech of this kind made by him after Sir Robert
Walpole's death, I am inclined to think Sir Walter must have made
a mistake as to the time of delivery of the speech mentioned in
the text.  [Secker, at that time Bishop of Oxford, says that
Walpole "spoke well against the motion." See post, letter to Sir
Horace Mann, dated March 24, 1742.

(26) Sir Walter Scott is in error when he says that Walpole
retired from the House of Commons in 1758, "at the active age of
forty-one."  This event occurred, as is here stated, in March,
1768, and when Walpole was consequently in his fifty-first year.

(27) Letter, dated Arlington Street, March 12th, 1768.  It is but
fair to mention, in opposition to the opinion respecting George
Grenville, here delivered by Walpole, that of no less an
authority than Burke, who says, "Mr. Grenville was a first-rate
figure in this country,"

(28) He had also offered to share his fortune with Mr. Conway in
the year 1744 (see letter of July 20th of that year), in order to
enable Mr. Conway to marry a lady he was then in love with.  He
ends his very pressing entreaties by saying, "For these reasons,
don't deny me what I have set my Heart on-the making your fortune
easy to you." Nor were these the only instances of generosity to
a friend, which we find in the life of Walpole.  In the year
1770, when the Abb`e Terrai was administering the finances of
France, (or, to use the more expressive language of Voltaire,
"Quand Terrai nous mangeait,") his economical reductions
occasioned the loss of a portion of her pension, amounting to
three thousand livres, to Madame du Deffand.  Upon this occasion
Walpole wrote thus to his old blind friend, who had presented a
memorial of her case to M. de St. Florentin, a course of
proceeding which Walpole did not approve of:-"Ayez assez
d'amiti`e pour moi pour accepter les trois mille livres de ma
part.  Je voudrais que la somme ne me f`ut pas aussi indiferente
qu'elle l'est, mais je vous jure qu'elle ne retranchera rien, pas
m`eme sur mes amusemens.  La prendriez vous de la main de la
grandeur, et la refuseriez vous de moi?  Vous me connaissez:
faites ce sacrifice `a mon orgueil, qui serait enchants de vous
avoir emp`ech`ee de vous abaisser jusqu'`a la sollicitation.
Votre m`emoire me blesse.  Quoi! vous, vous, r`eduite `a
repr`esenter vos malheurs!  Accordez moi, je vous conjure, la
grace que je vous demande `a genoux, et jouissez de la
satisfaction de vous dire, J'ai un ami qui ne permettra jamais
que je me jette aux pieds des grands.  Ma Petite, j'insiste.
Voyez, si vous aimez mieux me faire le plaisir le plus sensible,
ou de devoir une grace qui, ayant `et`e sollicit`ee, arrive
toujours trop tard pour contanter l'amiti`e.  Laissez moi go`uter
la joie la plus pure, de vous avoir mise `a votre aise, et que
cette joie soit un secret profond entre nous deux."  See Letters
of the Marquise de Deffand to the Honourable Horace Walpole.-It
was impossible to make a pecuniary offer with more earnestness or
greater delicacy; and Madame du Deffand's not having found it
necessary subsequently to accept it, in no degree diminishes the
merit of the proffered gift.

hard-hearted reproofs that repelled the warm effusions of
friendship with which poor Madame du Deffand (now old and blind)
addressed him, and of which he complained with the utmost
indignation, merely because, if her letters were opened by a

                                CHAPTER 1.


Motives to the Undertaking-Precedents-George the First's Reign a
Proem to the History of the Reigning House of Brunswick-The
Reminiscent introduced to that Monarch-His Person and Dress-The
Duchess of Kendal-her Jealousy of Sir Robert Walpole's Credit
with the King-and Intrigues to displace him, and make Bolingbroke
Minister.                                                     '


You were both so entertained with the old stories I told you one
evening lately, of what I recollected to have seen and heard from
my childhood of the courts of King George the First, and of his
son the Prince of Wales, afterwards George the Second, and of the
latter's princess, since Queen Caroline; and you expressed such
wishes that I would commit those passages (for they are scarce
worthy of the  title even of anecdotes) to writing, that, having
no greater pleasure than to please you both, nor any more
important or laudable occupation, I will begin to satisfy the
repetition of your curiosity.  But observe, I promise no more
than to begin; for I not only cannot answer that I shall have
patience to continue, but my memory is still so fresh, or rather
so retentive of trifles which first made impression on it, that
it is very possible my life (turned of seventy-one) may be
exhausted before my stock of remembrances; especially as I am
sensible of the garrulity of old age, and of its eagerness of
relating whatever it recollects, whether of moment or not.  Thus,
while I fancy I am complying with you, I may only be indulging
myself, and consequently may wander into many digressions for
which you will not care a straw, and which may intercept the
completion of my design.  Patience, therefore young ladies; and
if you coin an old gentleman into narratives, you must expect a
good deal of alloy.  I engage for no method, no regularity, no
polish.  My narrative will probably resemble siege-pieces, which
are struck of any promiscuous metals; and, though they bear the
impress of some sovereign's name, only serve to quiet the
garrison for the moment, and afterwards are merely hoarded by
collectors and virtuosos, who think their series not complete,
unless they have even the coins of base metal of every reign.  As
I date from my nonage, I must have laid up no state secrets.
Most of the facts I am going to tell you though new to you and to
most of the present age, were known perhaps at the time to my
nurse and my tutors.  Thus, my stories will have nothing to do
with history.

Luckily, there have appeared within these three months two
publications, that will serve as precedents for whatever I am
going to say: I mean Les Fragments of the Correspondence of the
Duchess of Orleans, (57) and those of the M`emoires of the Duc de
St. Simon. (58) Nothing more d`ecousu than both: they tell you
what they please; or rather, what their editors have pleased to
let them tell.  In one respect I shall be less satisfactory.
They knew and were well acquainted, or thought they were, with
their personages.  I did not at ten years old, penetrate
characters; and as George 1. died at the period where my
reminiscence begins, and was rather a good sort of man than a
shining king; and as the Duchess of Kendal was no genius, I heard
very little of either when he and her power were no more.  In
fact, the reign of George 1. was little more than the proem to
the history of England Under the House of Brunswick.  That family
was established here by surmounting a rebellion; to which
settlement perhaps the phrensy of the South Sea scheme
contributed, by diverting the national attention from the game of
faction to the delirium of stockjobbing; and even faction was
split into fractions by the quarrel between the king and the heir
apparent-another interlude, which authorizes me to call the reign
of George 1. a proem to the history of the reigning House of
Brunswick, so successively agitated by parallel feuds.

Commen`cons.

As my first hero was going off the stage before I ought to have
come upon it, it will be necessary to tell you why the said two
personages happened to meet just two nights before they were to
part for ever; a rencounter that barely enables me to give you a
general idea of the former's person and of his mistress's-or, as
has been supposed, his wife's.

As I was the youngest by eleven years of Sir Robert Walpole's
children by his first wife, and was extremely weak and delicate,
as you see me still, though with no constitutional complaint till
I had the gout after forty, and as my two sisters were
consumptive and died of consumptions, the supposed necessary care
of me (and I have overheard persons saying, "That child cannot
possibly live") so engrossed the attention of my mother, that
compassion and tenderness soon became extreme fondness; and as
the infinite good-nature of my father never thwarted any of his
children, he suffered me to be too much indulged, and permitted
her to gratify the first vehement inclination that I ever
expressed, and which, as I have never since felt any enthusiasm
for royal persons, I must suppose that the female attendants in
the family must have put into my head, to long to see the king.
This childish caprice was so strong, that my mother solicited the
Duchess of Kendal to obtain for me the honour of kissing his
Majesty's hand before he set out for Hanover. A favour so unusual
to be asked for a boy of ten years old, was still too slight to
be refused to the wife of the first minister for her darling
child; yet not being proper to be made a precedent, it was
settled to be in private, and at night.

Accordingly, the night but one before the king began his last
journey, my mother carried me at ten at night to the apartment of
the Countess of Walsingham, (59) on the ground floor, towards the
garden at St. James's, which opened into that of her aunt, the
Duchess of Kendal's: apartments occupied by George II. after his
queen's death, and by his successive mistresses, the Countesses
of Suffolk and Yarmouth.

Notice being given that the king was come down to supper, Lady
Walsingham took me alone into the duchess's ante-room, where we
found alone the king and her.  I knelt down, and kissed his hand.
He said a few words to me, and my conductress led me back to my
mother (60)

The person of the king is as perfect in my memory as if I saw him
but yesterday.  It was that of an elderly man, rather pale, and
exactly like his pictures and coins; Dot tall; of an aspect
rather good than august; with a dark tie-wig, a plain coat,
waistcoat, and breeches of snuff coloured cloth, with stockings
Of the same colour, and a blue riband over all.  So entirely was
he my object that I do not believe I once looked at the duchess;
but as I could not avoid seeing her on entering the room, I
remember that just beyond his Majesty stood a very tall, lean,
ill-favoured old lady but I did not retain the least idea of her
features, nor know what the colour of her dress was.

My childish loyalty, and the condescension in gratifying it,
were, I suppose, causes that contributed, very soon afterwards,
to make me shed a flood of tears for that sovereign's death,
when, with the other scholars at Eton college, I walked in
procession to the proclamation of the successor; and which
(though I think they partly felt because I imagined it became the
son of a prime-minister to be more concerned than other boys)
were no doubt imputed by many of the spectators who were
politicians, to fears of my father's most probable fall, but of
which I had not the smallest conception, nor should have met with
any more concern than I did when it really arrived, in the year
1742; by which time I had lost all taste for courts and princes
and power, as was natural to one who never felt an ambitious
thought for himself.

It must not be inferred from her obtaining this grace for me,
that the Duchess of Kendal was a friend to my father; on the
contrary, at that moment she had been labouring to displace him,
and introduce Lord Bolingbroke (61) into the administration; on
which I shall say more hereafter.

It was an instance of Sir Robert's singular fortune, or evidence
of his talents, that he not only preserved his power under two
successive monarchs, but in spite of the efforts of both their
mistresses (62) to remove him.  It was perhaps still more
remarkable, and an instance unparalleled, that Sir Robert
governed George the First in Latin, the King not speaking
English, (63) and his minister no German, nor even French. (64)
It was much talked of, that Sir Robert, detecting one of the
Hanoverian ministers in some trick or falsehood before the King'S
face, had the firmness to say to the German, "Mentiris,
impudentissime!"  The good-humoured monarch only laughed, as he
often did when Sir Robert complained to him of his Hanoverians
selling places, nor would be persuaded that it was not the
practice of the English court; and which an incident must have
planted in his mind with no favourable impression of English
disinterestedness. "This is a strange country!" said his Majesty;
"the first morning after my arrival at St. James's, I looked out
of the window, and saw a park with walks, a canal, etc. which
they told me were mine.  The next day, Lord Chetwynd, the ranger
of my park, sent me a fine brace of carp out of my canal; and I
was told I must give five guineas to Lord Chetwynd's servant for
bringing me my own carp out of my own canal in my own park!"
I have said, that the Duchess of Kendal was no friend of Sir
Robert, and wished to make Lord Bolingbroke minister in his room.
I was too young to know any thing of that reign, nor was
acquainted with the political cabals of the court, which,
however, I might have learnt from my father in the three years
after his retirement; but being too thoughtless at that time, nor
having your laudable curiosity, I neglected to inform myself of
many passages and circumstances, of which I have often since
regretted my faulty ignorance.

By what I can at present recollect, the Duchess seems to have
been jealous of Sir Robert's credit with the King, which he had
acquired, not by paying court, but by his superior abilities in
the House of Commons, and by his knowledge in finance, of which
Lord Sunderland and Craggs had betrayed their ignorance in
countennancing the South Sea scheme; and who, though more
agreeable to the King, had been forced to give way to Walpole, as
the only man capable of repairing that mischief.  The Duchess,
too, might be alarmed at his attachment to the Princess of Wales;
from whom, in case of the King's death, her grace could expect no
favour.  Of her jealousy I do know the following instance; Queen
Anne had bestowed the rangership of Richmond New Park on her
relations the Hydes for three lives, one of which was expired.
King George, fond of shooting, bought out the term of the last
Earl of Clarendon, and of his son Lord Cornbury, and frequently
shot there; having appointed my eldest brother, Lord Walpole,
ranger nominally, but my father in reality, wished to hunt there
once or twice a week.  The park had run to great decay under the
Hydes, nor was there any mansion (65) better than the common
lodges of the keepers.  The King ordered a stone lodge designed
by Henry, Earl of Pembroke, to be erected for himself, but merely
as a banqueting-house, (66) with a large eating-room, kitchen,
and necessary offices, where he might dine after his sport. Sir
Robert began another of brick for himself, and the under-ranger,
which by degrees, he much enlarged; usually retiring thither from
business, or rather, as he said himself, to do more business than
he could in town, on Saturdays and Sundays.  On that edifice, on
the thatched-house, and other improvements, he laid out fourteen
thousand pounds of his own money.  In the meantime, he hired a
small house for himself on the hill without the park; and in that
small tenement the King did him the honour of dining with him
more than once after shooting.  His Majesty, fond of private
joviality, (67) was pleased with punch after dinner, and indulged
in it freely.  The Duchess, alarmed at the advantage the minister
might make of the openness of the King's heart in those
convivial, unguarded hours, and at a crisis when she was
conscious Sir Robert was apprised of her inimical machinations in
favour of Lord Bolingbroke, enjoined the few Germans who
accompanied the King at those dinners to prevent his Majesty from
drinking too freely.  Her spies obeyed too punctually, and
without any address.  The King was offended, and silenced the
tools by the coarsest epithets in the German language.  He even,
before his departure, ordered Sir Robert to have the stone lodge
finished against his return: no symptom of a falling minister, as
has since been supposed Sir Robert then was, and that Lord
Bolingbroke was to have replaced him, had the King lived to come
back.  But my presumption to the contrary is more strongly
corroborated by what had recently passed: the Duchess had
actually prevailed on the King to see Bolingbroke secretly in his
closet.  That intriguing Proteus, aware that he might not obtain
an audience long enough to efface former prejudices, and make
sufficient impression on the King against Sir Robert, and in his
own favour, went provided with a memorial, which he left in the
closet. and begged his Majesty to peruse coolly at his leisure.
The King kept the paper, but no longer than till he saw Sir
Robert, to whom he delivered the poisoned remonstrance.  If that
communication prognosticated the minister's fall, I am at a loss
to know what a mark of confidence is.

Nor was that discovery the first intimation that Walpole had
received of the measure of Bolingbroke's gratitude.  The
minister, against the earnest representations of his family and
Most intimate friends, had consented to the recall of that
incendiary from banishment, (68) excepting only his readmission
into the House of Lords, that every field of annoyance might not
be open to his mischievous turbulence.  Bolingbroke, it seems,
deemed an embargo laid on his tongue would warrant his hand to
launch every envenomed shaft against his benefactor, who by
restricting had paid him the compliment of avowing that his
eloquence was not totally inoffensive.  Craftsmen, pamphlet,
libels, combinations, were showered on or employed for years
against the prime-minister, without shaking his power or ruffling
his temper; and Bolingbroke had the mortification of finding his
rival had abilities to maintain his influence against the
mistresses of two kings, with whom his antagonist had plotted in
vain to overturn him. (69)

the method and perspicuity of his calculations, and to the
extreme facility with which he arranged and explained the most
abstruse and difficult combinations of finance." Coxe.-E.

the King.  "Have you been so long in England," said the boy, "and
do not know what a chimney-sweeper is?  Why, they are like that
man there;" pointing to Lord Finch, afterwards Earl of Winchilsea

(66) It was afterwards enlarged by Princess Amelia; to whom her
rather, George II. had granted the reversion of the rangership
after Lord Walpole.  Her Royal Highness sold it to George III.
for a pension on Ireland of twelve hundred pounds a-year, and his
Majesty appointed Lord Bute ranger for life.

(67) The King Hated the parade of royalty.  When he went to the
opera, it was in no state; nor did he sit in the stage-box, nor
forwards, but behind the Duchess of Kendal and Lady Walsingham,
in the second box, now allotted to the maids of honour.

(68) Bolingbroke at his return could not avoid waiting on Sir
Robert to thank him, and was Invited to dine with him at Chelsea;
but whether tortured at witnessing Walpole's serene frankness and
felicity, or suffocated with indignation and confusion at being
forced to be obliged to one whom be hated and envied, the first
morsel he put into his mouth was near choking him, and he was
reduced to rise from table and leave the room for some minutes.
I never heard of their meeting more.

(69) George II. parted with Lady Suffolk, on Princess Amelia
informing Queen Caroline from Bath, that the mistress had
interviews there with Lord Bolingbroke.  Lady Suffolk, above
twenty years after, protested to me that she had not once seen
his lordship there; and I should believe she did not, for she was
a woman of truth: but her great intimacy and connexion with Pope
and Swift, the intimate friends of Bolingbroke, even before the
death of George I. and her being the channel through whom that
faction had flattered themselves they should gain the ear of the
new King, can leave no doubt of Lady Suffolk's support of that
party.  Her dearest friend to her death was William, afterwards
Lord Chetwynd, the known and most trusted confidant of Lord
Bolingbroke.  Of those political intrigues I shall say more in
these Reminiscences.



                                CHAPTER II



Marriage of George the First, while Electoral Prince, to the
Princess Sophia Dorothea-Assassination of Count
Konigsmark-Separation from the Princess-Left-handed
Espousal-Piety of the Duchess of Kendal-Confinement and Death of
Sophia Dorothea in the Castle of Alden-French Prophetess-The
King's Superstition-Mademoiselle Schulemberg--Royal
Inconstancy-Countess of Platen-Anne Brett--Sudden Death of George
the First.

George the First, while Electoral Prince, had married his cousin,
the Princess Dorothea (70) only child of the Duke of Zell; a
match of convenience to reunite the dominions of the family.
Though she was very handsome, the Prince, who was extremely
amorous, had several mistresses; which provocation, and his
absence in the army of the confederates, probably disposed the
Princess to indulge some degree of coquetry.  At that moment
arrived at Hanover the famous and beautiful Count Konigsmark,
(71) the charms of whose person ought not to have obliterated the
memory of his vile assassination of Mr. Thynne.(72)His vanity,
the beauty of the Electoral Princess, and the neglect under which
he found her, encouraged his presumption to make his addresses to
her, not covertly; and she, though believed not to have
transgressed her duty, did receive them too indiscreetly.  The
old Elector flamed at the insolence of so stigmatized a
pretender, and ordered him to quit his dominions the next day.
The Princess, surrounded by women too closely connected with her
husband, and consequently enemies of the lady they injured, was
persuaded by them to suffer the count to kiss her hand before his
abrupt departure and he was actually introduced by them into her
bedchamber the next morning before she rose.  From that moment he
disappeared nor was it known what became of him, till on the
death of George I., on his son the new King's first journey to
Hanover, some alterations in the palace being ordered by him, the
body of Konigsmark was discovered under the floor of the
Electoral Princess's dressing-room-the Count having probably been
strangled there the instant he left her, and his body secreted.
The discovery was hushed up; George II. entrusted the secret to
his wife, Queen Caroline, who told it to my father: but the King
was too tender of the honour of his mother to utter it to his
mistress; nor did Lady Suffolk ever hear of it, till I informed
her of it several years afterwards.  The disappearance of the
Count made his murder suspected, and various reports of the
discovery of his body have of late years been spread, but not
with the authentic circumstances.  The second George loved his
mother as much as he hated his father, and purposed, as was said,
had the former survived, to have brought her over and declared
her Queen Dowager. (73)  Lady Suffolk has told me her surprise,
on going to the new Queen the morning after the news arrived of
the death of George I., at seeing hung up in the Queen's
dressing-room a whole length of a lady in royal robes; and in the
bedchamber a half length of the same person, neither of which
Lady Suffolk had ever seen before.  The Prince had kept them
concealed, not daring to produce them during the life of his
father.  The whole length he probably sent to Hanover: (74) the
half length I have frequently and frequently seen in the library
of Princess Amelia, who told me it was the portrait of her
grandmother. she bequeathed it, with other pictures of her
family, to her nephew, the Landgrave of Hesse.

Of the circumstances that ensued on Konigsmark's disappearance I
am ignorant; nor am I acquainted with the laws of Germany
relative to divorce or separation: nor do I know or suppose that
despotism and pride allow the law to insist on much formality
when a sovereign has reason or mind to get rid of his wife.
Perhaps too much difficulty of untying the Gordian not of
matrimony thrown in the way of an absolute prince would be no
kindness to the ladies, but might prompt him to use a sharper
weapon, like that butchering husband, our Henry VIII.
Sovereigns, who narrow or let out the law of God according to
their prejudices and passions, mould their own laws no doubt to
the standard of their convenience.  Genealogic purity of blood is
the predominant folly of Germany; and the code of Malta seems to
have more force in the empire than the ten commandments.  Thence
was introduced that most absurd evasion of the indissolubility of
marriage, espousals with the left hand-as if the Almighty had
restrained his ordinance to one half of a man's person, and
allowed a greater latitude to his left side than to his right, or
pronounced the former more ignoble than the latter.  The
consciences both of princely and noble persons in Germany are
quieted, if the more plebeian side is married to one who would
degrade the more illustrious moiety-but, as if the laws of
matrimony had no reference to the children to be thence
propagated, the children of a left-handed alliance are not
entitled to inherit.  Shocking consequence of a senseless
equivocation, that only satisfies pride, not justice; and
calculated for an acquittal at the herald's Office, not at the
last tribunal.

Separated the Princess Dorothea certainly was, and never admitted
even to the nominal honours of her rank, being thenceforward
always styled Duchess of Halle.  Whether divorced (75) is
problematic, at least to me; nor can I pronounce, as, though it
was generally believed, I am not certain that George espoused the
Duchess of Kendal with his left hand.  As the Princess Dorothea
died only some months before him, that ridiculous ceremony was
scarcely deferred till then; and the extreme outward devotion of
the Duchess, who every Sunday went seven times to Lutheran
chapels, seemed to announce a realized wife.  As the genuine wife
was always detained in her husband's power, he seems not to have
wholly dissolved their union; for, on the approach of the French
army towards Hanover, during Queen Anne's reign, the Duchess of
Halle was sent home to her father and mother, who doted on their
only child, and did retain her for a whole year, and did implore,
though in vain that she might continue to reside with them.  As
her son too, George II., had thoughts of bringing her over and
declaring her Queen Dowager, one can hardly believe that a
ceremonial divorce had passed, the existence of which process
would have glared in the face of her royalty.  But though German
casuistry might allow her husband to take another wife with his
left hand, because his legal wife had suffered her right hand to
be kissed in bed by a gallant, even Westphalian or Aulic
counsellors could not have pronounced that such a momentary adieu
constituted adultery; and therefore of a formal divorce I must
doubt-and there I must leave that case of conscience undecided,
till future search into the Hanoverian chancery shall clear up a
point of little real importance.

I have said that the disgraced Princess died but a short time
before the King. (76) It is known that in Queen Anne's time there
was much noise about French prophets.  A female of that vocation
(for we know from Scripture that the gift of prophecy is not
limited to one gender) warned George I. to take care of his wife,
as he would not survive her a year.  That oracle was probably
dictated to the French Deborah by the Duke and Duchess of Zell,
'who might be apprehensive lest the' Duchess of Kendal should be
tempted to remove entirely the obstacle to her conscientious
union with their son-in-law.  Most Germans are superstitious,
even such as have few other impressions of religion.  George gave
such credit to the denunciation, that on the eve of his last
departure he took leave of his son and the Princess of Wales with
tears, telling them he should never see them more.  It was
certainly his own approaching fate that melted him, not the
thought of quitting for ever two persons he hated.  He did
sometimes so much justice to his son as to say, "Il est fougueux,
mais il a de l'honneur."-For Queen Caroline, to his confidants he
termed her "cette diablesse Madame la Princesse."

I do not know whether it was about the same period, that in a
tender mood he promised the Duchess of Kendal, that if she
survived him, and it were possible for the departed to return to
this world, he would make her a visit.  The Duchess, on his
death, so much expected the accomplishment of that engagement,
that a large raven, or some black fowl, flying into one of the
windows of her villa at Isteworth, she was persuaded it was the
soul of her departed monarch so accoutred, and received and
treated it with all the respect and tenderness of duty, till the
royal bird or she took their last flight.

George II., no more addicted than his father to too much
religious credulity, had yet implicit faith in the German notion
of vampires, and has more than once been angry with my father for
speaking irreverently of those imaginary bloodsuckers.

the Duchess of Kendal, of whom I have said so much, was when
Mademoiselle Schulemberg, maid of honour to the Electress Sophia,
mother of King George I. and destined by King William and the Act
of Settlement to succeed Queen Anne.  George fell in love with
Mademoiselle Schulemberg, though by no means an inviting
object-so little, that one evening when she was in waiting behind
the Electress's chair at a ball, the Princess Sophia, who had
made herself mistress of the language of her future subjects,
said in English to Mrs. Howard, afterwards Countess of Suffolk,
then at her court, "Look at that mawkin, and think of her being
my son's passion!"  Mrs. Howard, who told me the story, protested
that she was terrified, forgetting that Mademoiselle Schulemberg
did not understand English.

The younger Mademoiselle Schulemberg, who came over with her and
was created Countess Walsingham, passed for her niece; but was so
like to the King that it is not very credible that the Duchess,
who had affected to pass for cruel, had waited for the
left-handed marriage.

The Duchess under whatever denomination, had attained and
preserved to the last her ascendant over the king: but
notwithstanding that influence, he was not more constant to her
than he had been to his avowed wife; for another acknowledged
mistress, whom he also brought over, was Madame Kilmansegge,
Countess of Platen, who was created Countess of Darlington, and
by whom he was indisputably father of Charlotte, married to Lord
Viscount Howe, and mother of the present earl. (77) Lady Howe was
never publicly acknowledged as the Kings daughter; but Princess
Amelia, (78) treated her daughter, Mrs. Howe, (79) upon that
foot, and one evening, when I was present, gave her a ring, with
a small portrait of George I, with a crown of diamonds.

Lady Darlington, whom I saw at my mother's in my infancy, and
whom I remember by being terrified at her enormous figure, was as
corpulent and ample as the Duchess was long and emaciated.  Two
fierce black eyes, large and rolling beneath two lofty arched
eyebrows, two acres of cheeks spread with crimson, an ocean of
neck that overflowed and was not distinguished from the lower
part of her body, and no part restrained by stays 80) no wonder
that a child dreaded such an ogress, and that the mob of London
were highly diverted at the importation of so uncommon a
seraglio!  They were food from all the venom of the Jacobites;
and, indeed nothing could be grosser than the ribaldry that was
vomited out in lampoons, libels, and every channel of abuse,
against the sovereign and the new court, and chaunted even in
their hearing about the public streets. (81)

On the other hand, it was not till the last year or two of his
reign that their foreign sovereign paid the nation the compliment
of taking openly an English mistress.  That personage was Anne
Brett, eldest daughter by her second husband, (82) of the
repudiated wife of the Earl Of Macclesfield, the unnatural mother
of Savage the poet.  Miss Brett was very handsome, but dark
enough by her eyes, complexion, and hair, for a Spanish beauty.
Abishag was lodged in the palace under the eyes of Bathsheba, who
seemed to maintain her power, as other favourite sultanas have
done, by suffering partners in the sovereign's affections.  When
his Majesty should return to England, a countess's coronet was to
have rewarded the young lady's compliance, and marked her
secondary rank.  She might, however, have proved a troublesome
rival, as she seemed SO confident of the power of her charms,
that whatever predominant ascendant the Duchess might retain, her
own authority in the palace she thought was to yield to no one
else.  George I., when his son the Prince of Wales and the
Princess had quitted St. James's on their quarrel with him, had
kept back their three eldest daughters, who lived with him to his
death, even after there had outwardly been a reconciliation
between the King and Prince.  Miss Brett, when the King set out,
ordered a door to be broken out of her apartment into the royal
garden.  Anne, the eldest of the Princesses, offended at that
freedom, and not choosing such a companion in her walks, ordered
the door to be walled up again.  Miss Brett as imperiously
reversed that command. The King died suddenly, and the empire of
the new mistress and her promised coronet vanished.  She
afterwards married Sir William Leman, and was forgotten before
her reign had transpired beyond the confines of Westminster!
(70)  Her names were Sophia Dorothea ; but I call her by the
latter, to distinguish her from the Princess Sophia, her
mother-in-law, on whom the crown of Great Britain was settled.
(71) Konigsmark behaved with great intrepidity, and was wounded
at a bull-feast in Spain.  See Letters from Spain of the Contesse
D'Anois, vol. ii.  He was brother of the beautiful Comtesse de
Konigsmark, mistress of Augustus the Second, King of Poland.
(72) It was not this Count Konigsmark, but an elder brother, who
was accused of having suborned Colonel Vratz, Lieutenant Stern,
and one George Boroskey, to murder Mr. Thynne in Pall-Mall, on
the 12th of February, 1682, and for which they were executed in
that street on the 10th of March.  For the particulars, see
Howell's State Trials, vol. ix. p. 1, and Sir John Reresby's
Memoirs, p. 135. "This day," says Evelyn, in his Diary of the
10th of March, "was executed Colonel Vrats, for the execrable
murder of Mr. Thynne, set on by the principal, Konigsmark: he
went to execution like an undaunted hero, as one that had done a
friendly office for that base coward, Count Konigsmark, who had
hopes to marry his widow, the rich Lady Ogle, and was acquitted
by a corrupt jury, and so got away: Vrats told a friend of mine,
who accompanied him to the gallows, and gave him some advice,
that he did not value dying of a rush, and hoped and believed God
would deal with him like a gentleman." Mr. Thynne was buried in
Westminster Abbey; the manner of his death being represented on
his monument.  He was the Issachar of Absalom and Achitophel; in
which poem Dryden, describing the respect and favour with which
Monmouth was received upon his progress in the year 1691, Says:
"Hospitable hearts did most commend
Wise Issachar, his wealthy, western friend."

Reresby states, that Lady Ogle, immediately after the marriage,
"repenting herself of the match, fled from him into Holland,
before they were bedded." This circumstance added to the fact,
that Mr. Thynne had formerly seduced Miss Trevor, one of the
maids of honour to Catherine of Portugal, wife of Charles II.,
gave birth to the following lines:

"Here lies Tom Thynne, of Longleat Hall,
Who never would have miscarried,
Had he married the woman he lay withal,
Or lain with the woman he married."

On the 30th of May, in the same year, Lady Ogle was married to
Charles Seymour, Duke of Somerset.-E.

(73) Lady Suffolk thought he rather would have her regent of
Hanover; and she also told me, that George I. had offered to live
again with his wife, but she refused, unless her pardon were
asked publicly.  She said, what most affected her was the
disgrace that would be brought on her children; and if she were
only pardoned, that would not remove it. Lady Suffolk thought she
was then divorced, though the divorce was never published; and
that the old Elector consented to his son's marrying the Duchess
of Kendal with the left hand-but it seems strange, that George I.
should offer to live again with his wife, and yet be divorced
front her.  Perhaps George II. to vindicate his mother, supposed
that offer and her spirited refusal.

(74) George II. was scrupulously exact in separating and keeping
in each country whatever belonged to England or Hanover.  Lady
Suffolk told me, that on his accession he could not find a knife,
fork, and spoon of gold which had belonged to Queen Ann(@, and
which he remembered to have seen here at his first -arrival.  He
found them at Hanover on his first journey thither after he came
to the crown, and brought them back to England.  He could not
recollect much of greater value; for, on Queen Anne's death, and
in the interval before the arrival of the new family, such a
clearance had been made of her Majesty's jewels, or the new King
so instantly distributed what he found amongst his German
favourites, that, as Lady S. told me, Queen Caroline never
obtained of the late Queen's.jewels but one pearl necklace.

(75) George I., says Coxe, who never loved his wife, gave
implicit credit to the account of her infidelity, as related by
his father; consented to her imprisonment, and obtained from the
ecclesiastical consistory a divorce, which was passed on the 28th
of December 1694." Memoirs of Walpole.-E.

(76) "the unfortunate Sophia was confined in the castle of Alden,
situated on the small river Aller, in the duchy of Zell.  She
terminated her miserable existence, after a long captivity of
thirty-two years, on the 13th of November 1726, only seven months
before the death of George the First; and she was announced in
the Gazette, under the title of the Electress Dowager of Hanover.
During her whole confinement she behaved with no less mildness
than dignity; and, on receiving the sacrament once every week,
never omitted making the most solemn asseverations, that she was
not guilty of the crime laid to her charge." Coxe, vol. i. p.
268.-E.

(77) Admiral Lord Howe, and also of sir William, afterwards
Viscount Howe.-E.

(78) Second daughter of George the Second; born in 1711, died
October the 31st, 1786.

(79) Caroline, the eldest of Lady Howe's children, had married a
gentleman of her own name, John Howe, Esq, of Honslop, in the
county of Bucks.

(80) According to Coxe, she was, when young, a woman of great
beauty, but became extremely corpulent as she advanced in years.
"Her power over the King," he adds, "was not equal to that of the
Duchess of Kendal, but her character for rapacity was not
inferior." On the death of her husband, in 1721, she was created
Countess of Leinster in the kingdom of Ireland, Baroness of
Brentford, and Countess of Darlington.-E.

(81)  One of the German ladies, being abused by the mob, was said
to have put her head out of the coach, and cried in bad English,
"Good people, why you abuse us?  We come for all your goods."
"Yes, damn ye," answered a fellow in the crowd, "and for all our
chattels too." I mention this because on the death of Princess
Amelia the newspapers revived the story and told it of her,
though I had heard it threescore years before of one of her
grandfather's mistresses.

(82) Colonel Brett, the companion of Wycherley, Steele, Davenant,
etc. and of whom the following particulars are recorded by
Spence, on the authority of Dr. Young:-"The Colonel was a
remarkably handsome man.  The Countess looking out of her window
on a great disturbance in the street, saw him assaulted by some
bailiffs, who were going to arrest him.  She paid his debt,
released him from their pursuit, and soon after married him.
When she died, she left him more than he expected; with which he
bought an estate in the country, built a very handsome house upon
it, and furnished it in the highest taste; went down to see the
finishing of it, returned to London in hot weather and in too
much hurry; got a fever by it, and died.  Nobody had a better
taste of what would please the town, and his opinion was much
regarded by the actors and dramatic poets." Anecdotes, p. 355.-E.



                               CHAPTER III.



Quarrel between George the First and his Son-Earl of
Sunderland-Lord Stanhope-South Sea Scheme-Death of Craggs-Royal
Reconcilement-Peerage Bill defeated-Project for seizing the
Prince of Wales and conveying him to America-Duke of
Newcastle-Royal Christening-Open Rupture-Prince and Princess of
Wales ordered to leave the Palace.

One of the most remarkable occurrences in the reign of George I.
was the open quarrel between him and his son the Prince of Wales.
Whence the dissension originated; whether the prince's attachment
to his mother embittered his mind against his father, or whether
hatred of' his father occasioned his devotion to her, I do not
pretend to know.  I do suspect front circumstances, that the
hereditary enmity in the House of Brunswick between the parents
and their eldest sons dated earlier than the divisions between
the first two Georges.  The Princess Sophia was a woman of parts
and great vivacity: in the earlier part of her life she had
professed much zeal for the deposed House of Stuart, as appeared
by a letter of hers in print, addressed to the Chevalier de St.
George.  It is natural enough for all princes,-who have no
prospect of being benefited by the deposition of a crowned head,
to choose to think royalty an indelible character.  The Queen of
Prussia, daughter of George I. lived and died an avowed Jacobite.
The Princess Sophia, youngest child of the Queen of Bohemia, was
consequently the most remote from any pretensions to the British
crown; (83) but no sooner had King William procured a settlement
of it after Queen Anne on her Electoral Highness, than nobody
became a stancher Whig than the Princess Sophia, nor could be
more impatient to mount the throne of the expelled Stuarts.  It
is certain, that during the reign of Anne, the Elector George was
inclined to the Tories, though-after his mother's death and his
own accession he gave himself to the opposite party.  But if be
and his mother espoused different factions, Sophia found a ready
partisan in her grandson, the Electoral prince; (84) and it is
true, that the demand made by the Prince of his writ of summons
to the House of Lords as Duke of Cambridge, which no wonder was
so offensive to Queen Anne, was made in concert with his
grandmother, without the privity of the Elector his father.  Were
it certain, as was believed, that Bolingbroke and the Jacobites
prevailed on the Queen *85) to consent to her brother coming
secretly to England, and to seeing him in her closet; she might
have been induced to that step, when provoked by an attempt to
force a distant and foreign heir upon her while still alive. The
Queen and her heiress being dead, the new King and his son came
over in apparent harmony; and on his Majesty's first visit to his
electoral dominions, the Prince of Wales was even left Regent;
but never being trusted afterwards with that dignity on like
occasions, it is probable that the son discovered too much
fondness for acting the king, or that the father conceived a
jealousy of his son having done so.  Sure it is, that on the
King's return great divisions arose in the court; and the Whigs
were divided-some devoting themselves to the wearer of the crown,
and others to the expectant.  I shall not enter into the detail
of those squabbles, of which I am but superficially informed.
The predominant ministers were the Earls of Sunderland and
Stanhope.  The brothers-in-law, the Viscount Townshend and Mr.
Robert Walpole, adhered to the Prince.  Lord Sunderland is said
to have too much resembled as a politician the earl his father,
who was so principal an actor in the reign of James II. and in
bringing about the Revolution.  Between the earl in question and
the Prince of Wales grew mortal antipathy; of which -,in anecdote
told me by my father himself will leave no doubt.  When a
reconciliation had been patched up between the two courts, and my
father became first lord of the treasury a second time, Lord
Sunderland in a t`ete-`a-t`ete with him said, "Well, Mr. Walpole,
we have settled matters for the present; but we must think whom
we shall have next" (meaning in case of the King's demise).
Walpole said, "Your lordship may think as you please, but my part
is taken;" meaning to support the established settlement.

Earl Stanhope was a man of strong and violent passions, and had
dedicated himself to the army; and was so far from thinking of
any other line, that when Walpole, who first suggested the idea
of appointing him secretary of state, proposed it to him, he flew
into a furious rage, and was on the point of a downright quarrel,
looking on himself' as totally unqualified for the post, and
suspecting it for a plan of mocking him.  He died in one of those
tempestuous sallies, being pushed in the House of Lords on the
explosion of the South Sea scheme.  That iniquitous affair, which
Walpole had early exposed, and to remedy the mischiefs of which
he alone was deemed adequate, had replaced him at the head of
affairs, and obliged Sunderland to submit to be only a coadjutor
of the administration.  The younger Craggs, (86) a showy
vapouring man, had been brought forward by the ministers to
oppose Walpole; but was soon reduced to beg his assistance on one
(87) of their ways and means.  Craggs caught his death by calling
at the gate of Lady March, (88) who was ill of the small-pox; and
being told so by the porter, went home directly, fell ill of the
same distemper, and died.  His father, the elder Craggs, whose
very good sense Sir R. Walpole much admired, soon followed his
son, and his sudden death was imputed to grief; but having been
deeply dipped in the iniquities of the South Sea, and wishing to
prevent confiscation and save his ill-acquired wealth for his
daughters, there was no doubt of his having despatched himself.
When his death was divulged, Sir Robert Owned that the unhappy
man had in an oblique manner hinted his resolution to him.
The reconciliation of the royal family was so little cordial,
that I question whether the Prince did not resent Sir Robert
Walpole's return to the King's service.  Yet had Walpole defeated
a plan of Sunderland that @would in future have exceedingly
hampered the successor, as it was calculated to do; nor do I
affect to ascribe Sir Robert's victory directly to zeal for the
Prince: personal and just views prompted his opposition, and the
commoners of England were not less indebted to him than the
Prince.  Sunderland had devised a bill to restrain the crown from
ever adding above six peers to a number limited., (89) The actual
peers were far from disliking the measure; but Walpole, taking
fire, instantly communicated his dissatisfaction to all the great
commoners, who might for ever be excluded from the peerage.  He
spoke, he wrote, (90) he persuaded, and the bill was rejected by
the Commons with disdain, after it had passed the House of Lords.
(91)

But the hatred of some of the junta at court had gone farther,
horribly farther.  On the death of George 1. Queen Caroline found
in his cabinet a proposal of the Earl of Berkeley, (92) then, I
think, first lord of the admiralty, to seize the Prince of Wales,
and convey him to America, whence he should never be heard of
more.  This detestable project copied probably from the Earl of
Falmouth's offer to Charles II. with regard to his Queen, was in
the handwriting of Charles Stanhope, elder brother of the Earl of
Harrington: (93) and so deep was the impression deservedly made
on the mind of George II. by that abominable paper, that all the
favour of Lord Harrington, when secretary of state, could never
obtain the smallest boon to his brother, though but the
subordinate transcriber. (94) George I. was too humane to listen
to such an atrocious deed.  It was not very kind to the
conspirators to leave such an instrument behind him; and if
virtue and conscience will not check bold bad men from paying
court by detestable offers, the King's carelessness or
indifference in such an instance ought to warn them of the little
gratitude that such machinations can inspire or expect.

Among those who had preferred the service of the King to that of
the heir apparent, was the Duke of Newcastle;, (95) Who, having
married his sister to Lord Townshend, both his royal highness and
the viscount had expected would have adhered to that
connexion-and neither forgave his desertion.-I am aware of the
desultory manner in which I have told my story, having mentioned
the reconciliation of the King and Prince before I have given any
account of their public rupture.  The chain of my thoughts led me
into the preceding details, and, if I do not flatter myself, will
have let you into the motives of my dramatis personae better than
if I had 'more exactly observed chronology.- and as I am not
writing a regular tragedy, and profess but to relate facts as I
recollect them; or (if you will allow me to imitate French
writers of tragedy) may I not plead that I have unfolded my piece
as they do, by introducing two courtiers to acquaint one another,
and by bricole the audience, with what had passed in the
penetralia before the tragedy commences?

The exordium thus duly prepared, you must suppose, ladies, that
the second act opens with a royal christening The Princess of
Wales had been delivered of a second son.  The Prince had
intended his uncle, the Duke of York, Bishop of Osnaburg, should
with his Majesty be godfathers.  Nothing could equal the
indignation of his Royal Highness when the King named the Duke of
Newcastle for second sponsor, and would hear of no other.  The
christening took place as usual in the Princess's bedchamber.
Lady Suffolk, then in waiting as woman of the bedchamber, and of
most accurate memory painted the scene to me exactly.  On one
side of the bed stood the godfathers and godmother; on the other
the Prince and the Princess's ladies.  No sooner had the Bishop
closed the ceremony, than the Prince, crossing the feet of the
bed in a rage, stepped up to the Duke of Newcastle, and, holding
up his hand and fore-finger in a menacing attitude, said, "You
are a rascal, but I shall find you," meaning, in broken English,
"I shall find a time to be revenged."-"What was my astonishment,"
continued Lady Suffolk, "when going to the Princess's apartment
the next morning, the yeOMen in the guard-chamber pointed their
halberds at my breast, and told me I must not pass! I urged that
it was my duty to attend the Princess.  They said, 'No matter; I
must not pass that way.'"

In one word, the King had been so provoked at the Prince's
outrage in his presence, that it had been determined to inflict a
still greater insult on his Royal Highness.  His threat to the
Duke was pretended to be understood as a challenge; and to
prevent a duel he had actually been put under arrest-as if a
Prince of Wales could stoop to fight with a subject.  The arrest
was soon taken off; but at night the Prince and Princess were
ordered to leave the palace, (96) and retired to the house of her
chamberlain, the Earl of Grantham, in Albemarle Street.

(83) It is remarkable, that either the weak propensity of the
Stuarts to popery, or the visible connexion between regal and
ecclesiastic power, had such operation on many of the branches of
that family, who were at a distance from the crown of England, to
wear which it is necessary to be a Protestant, that two or three
of the daughters of the king and Queen of Bohemia, though their
parents had lost every thing in the struggle between the two
religions, turned Roman Catholics; and so did one or more of the
sons of the Princess Sophia, brothers of the Protestant
candidate, George I.

(84) Afterwards George II.

(85) I believe it was a fact, that the poor weak Queen, being
disposed even to cede the crown to her brother, consulted Bishop
Wilkins, called the Prophet, to know what would be the
consequence of such a step.  He replied, "Madam, you would be in
the Tower in a month, and dead in three." This Sentence, dictated
by common sense, her Majesty took for inspiration, and dropped
all thoughts of resigning the crown.

*86) James Craggs, Jun, buried in Westminster Abbey, with an
epitaph by Pope.  [Craggs died on the 16th of February, 1721.
His monument was executed by Guelphi, whom Lord Burlington
invited into the kingdom.  Walpole considered it graceful and
simple, but that the artist was an indifferent sculptor.  Dr.
Johnson objects to Pope's inscription, that it is partly in Latin
and partly in English.  "If either language," he says, "be
preferable to the other, let that only be used; for no reason can
be given why part of the information should be given in one
tongue, and part in another, on a tomb more than in any other
place or any other occasion: such an epitaph resembles the
conversation of a foreigner, who tells part of his meaning by
words, and conveys part by signs."]

(89) Queen Anne's creation of twelve peers at once, to obtain a
majority in the House of Lords, offered an ostensible plea for
the restrictions.

"The Thoughts of a Member of the Lower House, in relation to a
project for restraining and limiting the powers of the Crown in
the future creation of Peers." On the other side, Addison's pen
was employed in defending the measure, in a paper called "The Old
Whig," against Steele, who attacked it in a pamphlet entitled
"The Plebeian."-E.

(91) The effect of Sir Robert's speech on the House," says Coxe,
"exceeded the sanguine expectations: it fixed those who had
before been wavering and irresolute, brought over many who had
been tempted by the speciousness of the measure to favour
introduction, and procured its rejection, by a triumphant
majority of 269 against 177."  Memoirs, Vol. i.-E.

should induce him to assign to him any place of trust or honour.-

                                CHAPTER IV.


Bill of Pains and Penalties against Bishop Atterbury-Projected
Assassination of Sir Robert Walpole-Revival of the Order of the
Bath-Instance of George the First's good-humoured Presence of
Mind.

As this trifling work is a miscellany of detached recollections,
I will, ere I quit the article of George I., mention two subjects
of very unequal import, which belong peculiarly to his reign.
The first was the deprivation of Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester.
Nothing more offensive to men of priestly principles could easily
have happened: yet, as in a country of which the constitution was
founded on rational and liberal grounds, and where thinking men
had so recently exerted themselves to explode the prejudices
attached to the persons of Kings and churchmen, it was impossible
to defend the Bishop's treason but by denying it; or to condemn
his condemnation, but by supposing illegalities in the process:
both were vehemently urged by his faction, as his innocence was
pleaded by himself.  That punishment and expulsion from his
country may stagger the virtue even of a good man, and exasperate
him against his country, is perhaps natural, and humanity ought
to Pity it.  But whatever were the prepossessions of his friends
in his favour, charity must now believe that Atterbury was always
an ambitious, turbulent priest, attached to the House of Stuart,
and consequently no friend to the civil and religious liberties
of his country; or it must be acknowledged, that the
disappointment of his ambition by the Queen's death, and the
proscription of his ministerial associates, had driven on
attempts to restore the expelled family in hopes of realizing his
aspiring views.  His letters published by Nichols breathe the
impetuous spirit of his youth.  His exclamation on the Queen's
death, when he offered to proclaim the Pretender at Charing Cross
in pontificalibus, and swore, on not being supported, that there
was the best cause in England lost for want of spirit, is now
believed also.  His papers, deposited with King James's in the
Scottish College at Paris, proclaimed in what sentiments he died;
and the facsimiles of his letters published by Sir David
Dalrymple leave no doubt of his having in his exile entered into
the service of the Pretender.  Culpable -is he was, who but must
lament that so classic a mind had only assumed so elegant and
amiable a semblance as he adopted after the disappointment of his
prospects and hopes? His letter in defence of the authenticity of
Lord Clarendon's History, is one of the most beautiful and
touching specimens of eloquence in our language.

It was not to load the character of the bishop, nor to affect
candour by applauding his talents, that I introduced mention of
him, much less to impute to him -,my consciousnesses of the
intended crime that I am going to relate.  The person against
whom the blow was supposed to be meditated never, in the most
distant manner, suspected the bishop of being privy to the
plot-No: animosity of parties, and malevolence to the champions
of the House of Brunswick, no doubt suggested to some blind
zealots the perpetration of a crime which would necessarily have
injured the bishop's cause, and could by no means have prevented
his disgrace.

Mr. Johnstone, an ancient gentleman, who had been secretary of
state for Scotland, his country, in the reign of King William,
was a zealous friend of my father, Sir Robert, and who, in that
period of assassination plots, had imbibed such a tincture of
suspicion that he was continually notifying similar machinations
to my father, and warning him.  to be on his guard against them.
Sir Robert, intrepid and unsuspicious, (97) used to rally his
good monitor; and, when serious, told him that his life was too
constantly exposed to his enemies to make it of any use to be
watchful on any particular occasion; nor, though Johnstone often
hurried to him with intelligence of such designs, did he ever see
reason, but once, to believe in the soundness of the information.
That once arrived thus: a day or two before the bill of pains and
penalties was to pass the House of Commons against the Bishop of
Rochester, Mr. Johnstone advertised Sir Robert to be circumspect,
for three or four persons meditated to assassinate him as he
should leave the house at night.  Sir Robert laughed, and forgot
the notice.  The morning after the debate, Johnstone came to Sir
Robert with a kind of good-natured insult, telling him, that
though he had scoffed his advice, he had for once followed it,
and by so doing preserved his life.  Sir Robert understood not
what he meant, and protested he had not given more credit than
usual. to his warning.  "Yes," said Johnstone, "but you did; for
you did not come from the House last night in your own chariot."
Walpole affirmed that he did; but his friend persisting in his
asseveration, Sir Robert called one of the footmen, who replied,
"I did call up your honour's carriage; but Colonel Churchill
being with you, and his chariot driving up first, your honour
stepped into that, and your own came home empty."
Johnstone, triumphing on his own veracity, and pushing the
examination farther, Sir Robert's coachman recollected that, as
he left Palace-yard, three men, much muffled, had looked into the
empty chariot.  The mystery was never farther cleared up; and my
father frequently said it was the only instance of the kind in
which he had ever seen any appearance of a real design.

The second subject that I promised to mention, and it shall be
very briefly, was the revival of the Order of the Bath.  It was
the measure of Sir Robert Walpole, and was an artful bank of
thirty-six ribands to supply a fund of favours in lieu of places.
He meant, too, to stave off the demand for garters, and intended
that the red should be a step to the blue, and accordingly took
one of the former himself.  He offered the new order to old
Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, for her grandson the duke, and for
the Duke of Bedford, who had married one of her grand-daughters.
(98) She haughtily replied, they should take nothing but the
garter. "Madam," said Sir Robert coolly, "they who take the bath
will the sooner have the garter." The next year he took the
latter himself with the Duke of Richmond, both having been
previously installed knights of the revived institution.

Before I quit King George I. I will relate a story, very
expressive of his good-humoured presence of mind.

On one of his journeys to Hanover his coach broke.  At a distance
in view was the chateau of a considerable German nobleman.  The
king sent to borrow assistance.  The possessor came, conveyed the
king to his house, and begged the honour of his Majesty's
accepting a dinner while his carriage was repairing; and, while
the dinner was preparing, begged leave to amuse his Majesty with
a collection of pictures which he had formed in several tours to
Italy.  But what did the king see in one of the rooms but an
unknown portrait of a person in the robes and with the regalia of
the sovereigns of Great Britain!  George asked whom it
represented.  The nobleman replied, with much diffident but
decent respect, that in various journeys to Rome he had been
acquainted with the Chevalier de St. George. who had done him the
honour of sending him that picture. "Upon my word," said the king
instantly, "it is very like to the family." It was impossible to
remove the embarrassment of the proprietor with more good
breeding.

(97) At the time of the Preston rebellion, a Jacobite, who
sometimes furnished Sir Robert with intelligence, sitting alone
with him one night, suddenly putting his hand into his bosom and
rising, said, "Why do not I kill you now?"  Walpole starting up,
replied, "Because I am a younger man and a stronger."  They sat
down again, and discussed the person's information But Sir Robert
afterwards had reasons for thinking that the spy had no intention
of assassination, but had hoped, by intimidating, to extort money
from him.  Yet if no real attempt was made on his life, it was
not from want of suggestions to it: one of the weekly journals
pointed out Sir Robert's frequent passing a Putney bridge late at
night, attended but by one or two servants, on his way to New
Park, as a proper place; and after Sir Robert's death, the second
Earl of Egmont told me, that he was once at a consultation of the
Opposition, in which it was proposed to have Sir Robert murdered
by a mob, of which the earl had declared his abhorrence.  Such an
attempt was actually made in 1733, at the time of the famous
excise bill.  As the minister descended the stairs of the House
of commons on the night he carried the bill, he was guarded on
one side by his second son Edward, and on the other by General
Charles Churchill; but the crowd behind endeavoured to throw him
down, as he was a bulky man, and trample him to death; and that
not succeeding, they tried to strangle him by pulling his red
cloak tight-but fortunately the strings broke by the violence of
the tug.

(98) Wriothesly, Duke of Bedford, had married Lady Anne Egerton,
only daughter of Scroop, Duke of Bridgewater, by Lady Elizabeth
Churchill, daughter of John, Duke of Marlborough.  See VOL. I. 8.



                                CHAPTER V.


Accession of George the Second-Sir Spencer Compton-Expected
Change in Administration-Continuation of Lord Townshend-and Sir
Robert Walpole by the Intervention of Queen Caroline-Mrs. Howard,
afterwards Countess of Suffolk-Her character by
Swift-and by Lord Chesterfield.


The unexpected death of George I. on his road to Hanover was
instantly notified by Lord Townshend, secretary of state, who
attended his Majesty, to his brother Sir Robert Walpole, who as
expeditiously was the first to carry the news to the
successor and hail him King.  The next step was, to ask who his
Majesty would please should draw his speech to the
Council.  "Sir Spencer Compton," replied the new monarch.  The
answer was decisive, and implied Sir Robert's dismission.  Sir
Spencer Compton was Speaker of the House of Commons, and
treasurer, I think, at that time, to his Royal Highness, who by
that first command, implied his intention of making Sir Spencer
his prime-minister.  He was a worthy man, of
exceedingly grave formality, but of no parts, as his conduct
immediately proved.  The poor gentleman was so little
qualified to accommodate himself to the grandeur of the
moment, and to conceive how a new sovereign should address
himself to his ministers, and he had also been so far from
meditating to supplant the premier,(99) that, in his distress, it
was to Sir Robert himself that he had recourse, and whom he
besought to make the draught of the Kin(,'s speech for him.  The
new Queen, a better judge than her husband of the
capacities of the two candidates, and who had silently watched
for a moment proper for overturning the new designations, did not
lose a moment in observing to the King how prejudicial it would
be to his affairs to prefer to the minister in
possession a man in whose own judgment his predecessor was the
fittest person to execute his office.  From that moment there was
no more question of Sir Spencer Compton as prime-minister.  He
was created an earl, soon received the garter, and became
president of that council, at the head of which he was much
fitter to sit than to direct.  Fourteen years afterwards, he was
again nominated by the same Prince to replace Sir Robert as first
lord of the treasury on the latter's forced
resignation, but not -.is prime-minister; the conduct of
affairs being soon ravished from him by that dashing genius the
Earl of Granville, who reduced him to a cipher for the little
year in which he survived, and in which his incapacity had been
obvious.

The Queen, impatient to destroy all hopes of change, took the
earliest opportunity of declaring her own sentiments.  The
instance I shall cite will be a true picture of courtiers.  Their
Majesties had removed from Richmond to their temporary palace in
Leicester-fields(100)on the very evening of their receiving
notice of their accession to the Crown, and the next day all the
nobility and gentry in town crowded to kiss their hands; my
mother amongst the rest, who, Sir Spencer Compton's designation,
and not its evaporation, being known, could not make her way
between the scornful backs and elbows of her late devotees, nor
could approach nearer to the Queen than the
third or fourth row; but no sooner was she descried by her
Majesty than the Queen said aloud, "There, I am sure, I see a
friend!"  The torrent divided and shrunk to either side; "and as
I came away," said my mother, "I might have walked over their
heads if I had pleased."

The preoccupation of the Queen in favour of Walpole must be
explained.  He had early discovered that, in whatever
gallantries George Prince of Wales indulged or affected, even the
person of his Princess was dearer to him than any charms in his
mistresses; and though Mrs. Howard (afterwards Lady Suffolk) was
openly his declared favourite, as avowedly as the Duchess of
Kendal was his father's, Sir Robert's sagacity
discerned that the power would be lodged with the wife, not with
the mistress; and he not only devoted himself to the
Princess; but totally abstained from even visiting Mrs.
Howard; while the injudicious multitude concluded. that the
common consequences of an inconstant husband's passion 'for his
concubine would follow, and accordingly warmer, if not public
vows were made to the supposed favourite, than to the Prince's
consort.  They, especially, who in the late reign had been out of
favour at court, had, to pave their future path to favour, and to
secure the fall of Sir Robert Walpole,
sedulously, and no doubt zealously, dedicated themselves to the
mistress: Bolingbroke secretly, his friend Swift openly, and as
ambitiously, cultivated Mrs. Howard; and the
neighbourhood of Pope's villa to Richmond facilitated their
intercourse, though his religion forbade his entertaining
views beyond those of serving his friends.  Lord Bathurst,
another of that connexion, and Lord Chesterfield, too early for
his interest, founded their hopes on Mrs. Howard's
influence; but astonished and disappointed at finding Walpole not
shaken from his seat, they determined on an experiment that
should be the touchstone of Mrs. Howard's credit.  They persuaded
her to demand of the new King an Earl's coronet for Lord
Bathurst.  She did-the Queen put in her veto, and Swift, in
despair, returned to Ireland, to lament Queen Anne, and curse
Queen Caroline, under the mask of patriotism, in a
country he abhorred and despised.(101)

To Mrs. Howard, Swift's ingratitude was base.  She,
indubitably, had not only exerted all her interest to second his
and his faction's interests, but loved Queen Caroline and the
minister as little as they did; yet, when Swift died, he left
behind him a Character of Mrs. Howard by no means
flattering, which was published in his posthumous works.

On its appearance, Mrs. Howard (become Lady Suffolk) said to me,
in her calm, dispassionate manner, "All I can say is, that it is
very different from one that he drew of me, and sent to me, many
years ago, and which I have, written by his own
hand."(102

Lord Chesterfield, rather more ingenuous-as his character of her,
but under a feigned name, was printed in his life, though in a
paper of which he was not known to be the author-was not more
consistent.  Eudosia, described in the weekly journal called
Common Sense, for September 10, 1737, was meant for Lady Suffolk:
yet was it no fault of hers that he was
proscribed at court; nor did she perhaps ever know, as he
never did till the year before his death, when I acquainted him
with it by his friend Sir John Irwin, why he had been put into
the Queen's Index expurgatorius.(102)  The queen had an obscure
window at St. James's that looked into a dark passage, lighted
only by a single lamp at night, which looked upon Mrs. Howard's
apartment.  Lord Chesterfield, one Twelfth-night at court, had
won so large a sum of money, that he thought it imprudent to
carry it home in the dark, and deposited it with the mistress.
Thence the queen inferred great intimacy, and thenceforwards Lord
Chesterfield could obtain no favour from court- and finding
himself desperate, went into opposition.  My father himself long
afterwards told me the story, and had become the principal object
of the peer's satiric wit, though he had not been the mover of
his disgrace.  The weight of that anger fell more disgracefully
on the king, as I shall mention in the next chapter.

I will here interrupt the detail of what I have heard of the
commencement of that reign, and farther anecdotes of the queen
and the mistress, till I have related the second very
memorable transaction of that era; and which would come in
awkwardly, if postponed till I have despatched many subsequent
particulars.

(99) Sir Spencer Compton, afterwards Earl of Wilmington, was so
far from resenting Sir Robert's superior talents, that he
remained steadfastly -,attached to him; and when the famous
motion for removing Sir Robert was made in both Houses, Lord
Wilmington, though confined to his bed, and with his head
blistered, rose and went to the House of Lords, to vote
against a measure that avowed its own injustice, by being
grounded only on popular clamour.

(100) It was the town residence of the Sidneys, Earls of
Leicester, of whom it was hired, as it was afterwards by
Frederick, Prince of Wales, on a similar quarrel with his
father.  He added to it Savile House, belonging to Sir George
Savile, for his children.

(101) Mr. Croker, in his biographical notice of Lady Suffolk,
prefixed to the edition of her Letters, thus satisfactorily
confutes this anecdote: "On this it is to be observed, that
George the Second was proclaimed on the 14th of June 1727, that
Swift returned to Ireland in the September of the same year, and
that the first creation of peers in that reign did not take place
till the 28th of May 1728.  Is it credible, that Mrs. Howard
should have made such a request of the new King, and suffered so
decided a refusal ten or eleven months before any peers were
made?  But, again, upon this first
creation of peers Mrs. Howard's brother is the second name.  Is
it probable that, with so great an object for her own
family in view, she risked a solicitation for Lord Bathurst? But
that which seems most convincing, is Swift's own
correspondence.  In a letter to Mrs.  of the 9th of July 1727, in
which, rallying her on the solicitation to which the new King
would be exposed, he says, - 'for my part, you may be secure,
that I will never venture to recommend even a mouse to Mrs.
Cole's cat, or a shoe-cleaner to your meanest domestic.'" Vol. i.
p. xxv-E.

(102) "This," says her biographer, "is a complete mistake, to
give it no harsher name.  The Character which Swift left
behind, and which was published in his posthumous works, is the
very same which Lady Suffolk had in her possession.  If it be not
flattering, it is to Swift's honour that he 'did not condescend
to flatter her in the days of her highest favour; and the
accusation of having written another less favourable, is wholly
false." Ibid. vol. i. p. xxxviii.-E.

(103) "It certainly would have been extraordinary," observes Mr.
Croker, "that Lord Chesterfield, in 1137, when he was on terms of
the most familiar friendship with Lady Suffolk,
should have published a deprecatory character of her, and in
revenge too, for being disgraced at court-Lady Suffolk being at
the same time in disgrace also.  But, unluckily for
Walpole's conjecture, the character of Eudosia (a female
savant, as the name imports,) has not the slightest
resemblance to Lady Suffolk, and contains no allusion to
courts or courtiers." Ibid. vol. ii. p. xxxiii-E.



                                CHAPTER VI.


Destruction of George the First's will.

At the first council held by the new sovereign, Dr. Wake,
Archbishop of Canterbury, produced the will of the late King, and
delivered it to the successor, expecting it would be
opened and read in council.  On the contrary, his Majesty put it
into his pocket, and stalked out of the room without
uttering a word on the subject.  The poor prelate was
thunderstruck, and had not the presence of mind or the courage to
demand the testament's being opened, or at least to have it
registered.  No man present chose to be more hardy than the
person to whom the deposit had been trusted-perhaps none of them
immediately conceived the possible violation of so solemn an act
so notoriously existent; still, as the King never
mentioned the will more, whispers only by degrees informed the
public that the will was burnt; at least that its injunctions
were never fulfilled.


What the contents were was never ascertained.  Report said, that
forty thousand pounds had been bequeathed to the Duchess of
Kendal; and more vague rumours spoke of a large legacy to the
Queen of Prussia, daughter of the late King.  Of that
bequest demands were afterwards said to have been frequently and
roughly made by her son the great King of Prussia, between whom
and his uncle subsisted much inveteracy.

The legacy to the ]Duchess was some time after on the brink of
coming to open and legal discussion.  Lord Chesterfield
marrying her niece and heiress, the Countess of Walsingham, and
resenting his own proscription at court, was believed to have
instituted, or at least to have threatened, a suit for recovery
of the legacy to the Duchess, to which he was then become
entitled; and it was as confidently believed that he was quieted
by the payment of twenty thousand pounds.

But if the Archbishop had too timidly betrayed the trust
reposed in him from weakness and want of spirit, there were two
other men who had no such plea of imbecility, and who, being
independent, and above being awed, basely sacrificed their honour
and their integrity for positive sordid gain.  George the First
had deposited duplicates of his will with two sovereign German
princes: I will not specify them, because at this distance of
time I do not, perfectly recollect their
titles; but I was actually, some years ago, shown a copy of a
letter from one of our ambassadors abroad to-a secretary of state
at that period, in which the ambassador said, one of the princes
in question would accept the proffered subsidy, and had
delivered, or would deliver, the duplicate of the King's will.
The other trustee, was no doubt, as little
conscientious and as corrupt.  It is pity the late King of
Prussia did not learn their infamous treachery.

Discoursing once with Lady Suffolk on that suppressed
testament, she made the only plausible shadow of an excuse that
could be made for George the Second.  She told me that George the
First had burnt two wills made in favour of his son.  They were,
probably, the wills of the Duke and Duchess of Zell; or one of
them might be that of his mother, the
Princess Sophia.  The crime of the first George could only
palliate, not justify, the criminality of the second; for the
second did -not punish the maturity, but the innocent.  But bad
precedents are always dangerous, and too likely to be
copied. (104)

(104) On the subject of the royal will, Walpole, in his
Memoires, vol. ii. p. 458, relates the following
anecdote:-"The morning after the death of George the Second, Lord
Waldegrave showed the Duke of Cumberland an extraordinary piece:
it was endorsed, 'very private paper,' and was a letter from the
Duke of Newcastle to the first Earl of Waldegrave; in which his
Grace informed the Earl, then our ambassador in
France, that he had received by the messenger the copy of the
will and codicil of George the First; that he had delivered it to
his Majesty, who put it into the fire without opening it: 'So,'
adds the Duke, 'we do not know whether it confirms the other or
not;' and he proceeds to say, 'Despatch a messenger to the Duke
Of Wolfenbuttle with the treaty, in which he is granted all he
desired; and we expect, by return of the
messenger, the original will from him.'  George the First had
left two wills; one in the hands of Dr. Wake, Archbishop of
Canterbury, the other with the Duke of Wolfenbuttle.  He had been
in the right to take these precautions: he himself had burned his
wife's testament, and her and her father's, the duke of Zell;
both of whom had made George the Second their heir--a paliative
of the latter's obliquity, if justice would allow of any
violation."  From the following passage in
Boswell's Life of Johnson, the Doctor appears to have given
credence to the story of the will:--"tom Davies instanced
Charles the Second; Johnson taking fire at an attack upon that
prince, exclaimed, "charles the Second was licentious in his
practice, but he always had a reverence for what was good;
Charles the Second was not such a man as George the Second; he
did not destroy his father's will' he did not betray those over
whom he ruled' he did not let the French fleet pass
ours.'  He roared with prodigious violence against George the
Second.  When he ceased, Moody interjected, in an Irish tone, and
a comic look, 'Ah! poor George the Second!'" See vol. v. p. 284,
ed. 1835.-E.



                               CHAPTER VII.


History of Mrs. Howard, afterwards Countess of Suffolk-Miss
Bellenden-Her Marriage with Colonel John Campbell, afterwards
fourth Duke of Argyle-Anecdotes of Queen Caroline-her last
Illness and Death-Anecdote of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough-Last
Years of George the Second-Mrs. Clayton, afterwards Lady
Sundon-Lady Diana Spencer-Frederick, Prince of Wales-Sudden
Removal of the Prince and Princess from Hampton Court to St.
James's -Birth of a Princess-Rupture with the King-Anecdotes of
Lady Yarmouth.

I will now resume the story of Lady Suffolk whose history, though
she had none of that influence on the transactions of the cabinet
that was expected, will still probably be more entertaining to
two young ladies than a magisterial detail of political events,
the traces of which at least may be found in journals and brief
chronicles of the times.  The interior of courts, and the lesser
features of history, are precisely those with which we are least
acquainted,-I mean of the age preceding our own.  Such anecdotes
are forgotten in the multiplicity of those that ensue, or reside
only in the memory of idle old persons, or have not yet emerged
into publicity from the portefeuilles of such garrulous
Brant`omes as myself.  Trifling I will not call myself; for,
while I have such charming disciples as you two to inform; and
though acute or plodding politicians, for whom they are not
meant, may condemn these pages; which is preferable, the labour
of an historian who toils for fame and for applause from he knows
not whom; or my careless commission to paper of perhaps
insignificant passages that I remember, but penned for the
amusement of a pair of such sensible and cultivated minds as I
never met at so early an age, and whose fine eyes I do know will
read me With candour, and allow me that mite of fame to which I
aspire, their approbation of my endeavours to divert their
evenings in the country?  O Guicciardin! is posthumous renown so
valuable as the satisfaction of reading these court-tales to the
lovely Berrys?

Henrietta Hobart was daughter of Sir Henry, and sister of Sir
John Hobart, Knight of the Bath on the revival of the order, and
afterwards by her interest made a baron; and since created Earl
of Buckinghamshire.

She was first married to Mr. Howard, the younger brother of more
than one Earl of Suffolk; to which title he at last succeeded
himself, and left a son by her, who was the last earl of that
branch.  She had but the slender fortune of an ancient baronet's
daughter; and Mr. Howard's circumstances were the reverse of
opulent.  It was the close of Queen Anne's reign: the young
couple saw no step more prudent than to resort to Hanover, and
endeavour to ingratiate themselves with the future sovereigns of
England.  Still so narrow was their fortune, that Mr. Howard
finding it expedient to give a dinner to the Hanoverian
ministers, Mrs. Howard is said to have sacrificed her beautiful
head of hair to pay for the expense.  It must be recollected,
that at that period were in fashion those enormous full-bottomed
wigs, which often cost twenty and thirty guineas.  Mrs. Howard
was extremely acceptable to the intelligent Princess Sophia; but
did not at that time make farther impression on the Electoral
Prince, than, on his father's succession to the crown, to be
appointed one of the bedchamber-women to the new Princess of
Wales.

The elder Whig politicians became ministers to the King.  The
most promising of the young lords and gentleman of that party,
and the prettiest and liveliest of the young ladies, formed the
new court of the Prince and Princess of Wales.  The apartment of
the bedchamber-woman in waiting became the fashionable evening
rendez-vous of the most distinguished wits and beauties.  Lord
Chesterfield, then Lord Stanhope, Lord Scarborough, Carr Lord
Hervey, elder brother of the more known John Lord Hervey, and
reckoned to have superior parts, General (at that time only
Colonel) Charles Churchill, and others not necessary to rehearse,
were constant attendants: Miss Lepelle, afterwards Lady Hervey,
my mother, Lady Walpole, Mrs. Selwyn, mother of the famous
George, and herself of much vivacity and pretty, Mrs. Howard, and
above all for universal admiration, Miss Bellenden, one of the
maids of honour.  Her face and person were charming; lively she
was almost to `etourderie; (105) and so agreeable she was, that I
never heard her mentioned afterwards by one of her contemporaries
who did not prefer her as the most perfect creature they ever
knew.  The Prince frequented the waiting-room, and soon felt a
stronger inclination for her than he ever entertained but for his
Princess.  Miss Bellenden by no means felt a reciprocal passion.
The Prince's gallantry was by no means delicate; and his avarice
disgusted her.  One evening sitting by her, he took out his purse
and counted his money.  He repeated the numeration: the giddy
Bellenden lost her patience, and cried out, "Sir, I cannot bear
it! if you count your money any more, I will go out of the room."
The chink of the gold did not tempt her more than the person of
his Royal Highness.  In fact, her heart was engaged; and so the
Prince, finding his love fruitless, suspected.  He was even so
generous as to promise her, that if she would discover the object
of her Choice, and would engage not to marry without his privity,
he would consent to the match, and would be kind to her husband.
She gave him the promise he exacted, but without acknowledging
the person; and then, lest his Highness should throw any obstacle
in the way, married, without his knowledge, Colonel Campbell, one
of the grooms of his bedchamber, and who long afterwards
succeeded to the title of Argyle at the death of Duke Archibald.
(106)  The Prince never forgave the breach of her word; and
whenever she went to the drawing-room, as from her husband's
situation she was sometimes obliged to do, though trembling at
what she knew she was to undergo, the Prince always stepped up to
her, and whispered some very harsh reproach in her ear.  Mrs.
Howard was the intimate friend of Miss Bellenden; had been the
confidante of the Prince's passion; and, on Mrs. Campbell's
eclipse, succeeded to her friend's post of favourite, but not to
her resistance.

>From the steady decorum of Mrs. Howard, I should conclude that
she would have preferred the advantages of her situation to the
ostentatious `eclat of it: but many obstacles stood in the way of
total concealment; nor do I suppose that love had any share in
the sacrifice she made of her virtue.  She had felt poverty, and
was far from disliking power.  Mr. Howard was probably as little
agreeable to her as he proved worthless.  The King, though very
amorous, was certainly more attracted by a silly idea he had
entertained of gallantry being becoming, than by a love of
variety; and he added the more egregious folly of fancying that
inconstancy proved he was not governed; but so awkwardly did he
manage that artifice, that it but demonstrated more clearly the
influence of the Queen.  With such a disposition, secrecy would
by no means have answered his Majesty's views; yet the publicity
of the intrigue was especially owing to Mr. Howard, who, far from
ceding his wife quietly, went one night into the quadrangle of
St. James's, and vociferously demanded her to be restored to him
before the guards and other audience.  Being thrust out, he sent
a letter to her by the Archbishop of Canterbury, reclaiming her,
and the Archbishop by his instructions consigned the summons to
the Queen, who had the malicious pleasure of delivering the
letter to her rival. (107)

Such intemperate proceedings by no means invited the new mistress
to leave the asylum of St. James's.  She was safe while under the
royal roof: even after the rupture between the King and Prince
(for the affair commenced in the reign of the first George), and
though the Prince, on quitting St. James's, resided in a private
house, it was too serious an enterprise to attempt to take his
wife by force out of the palace of the Prince of Wales.  The case
was altered, when, on the arrival of summer, their Royal
Highnesses were to remove to Richmond.  Being only woman of the
bedchamber, etiquette did not allow Mrs. Howard the entr`ee of
the coach with the Princess.  She apprehended that Mr. Howard
might seize her on the road.  To baffle such an attempt, her
friends, John, Duke of Argyle, and his brother, the Earl of
Islay, called for her in the coach of one of them by eight
o'clock in the morning of the day, at noon of which the Prince
and Princess were to remove, and lodged her safely in their house
at Richmond.  During the summer a negotiation was commenced with
the obstreperous husband, and he sold his own noisy honour and
the possession of his wife for a pension of twelve hundred
a-year. (108)

These now little-known anecdotes of Mr. Howard's behaviour I
received between twenty and thirty years afterwards, from the
mouth of Lady Suffolk herself.  She had left the court about the
year 1735, and passed her summers at her villa of Marble Hill, at
Twickenham, living very retired both there and in London.  I
purchased Strawberry Hill in 1747; and being much acquainted with
the houses of Dorset, Vere, and others of Lady Suffolk's
intimates, was become known to her; though she and my father had
been at the head of two such hostile factions at court.  Becoming
neighbours, and both, after her second husband's death, living
single and alone, our acquaintance turned to intimacy.  She was
extremely deaf, (109) and consequently had more satisfaction in
narrating than in listening; her memory both of remote and of the
most recent facts was correct beyond belief. I, like you, was
indulgent to, and fond of old anecdotes.  Each of us knew
different Parts of many court stories, and each was eager to
learn what either could relate more; and thus, by comparing
notes, we sometimes could make out discoveries of a third
circumstance, (110) before unknown to both.  Those evenings, and
I had many of them in autumnal nights, were extremely agreeable;
and if this chain of minutiae proves so to you, you owe perhaps
to those conversations the fidelity of my memory, which those
repetitions recalled and stamped so lastingly.

In this narrative will it be unwelcome to you, if I subjoin a
faithful portrait of the heroine of this part?  lady Suffolk was
of a just height, well made, extremely fair, with the finest
light brown hair; was remarkably genteel, and always well dressed
with taste and simplicity.  Those were her personal charms, for
her face was regular and agreeable rather than beautiful and
those charms she retained with little diminution to her death at
the age of seventy-nine. (111) Her mental qualifications were by
no means shining; her eyes and countenance showed her character,
which was grave and mild.  Her strict love of truth and her
accurate memory were always in unison, and made her too
circumstantial on trifles.  She was discreet without being
reserved; and having no bad qualities, and being constant to her
connexions, she preserved uncommon respect to the end of her
life; and from the propriety and decency of her behaviour was
always treated as if her virtue had never been questioned; her
friends even affecting to suppose, that her connexion with the
King had been confined to pure friendship.  Unfortunately, his
Majesty's passions were too indelicate to have been confined to
Platonic love for a woman who was deaf, (112)-sentiments he had
expressed in a letter to the Queen, who, however jealous of Lady
Suffolk, had latterly dreaded the King's contracting a new
attachment to a younger rival, and had prevented Lady Suffolk
from leaving the court as early as she had wished to do.  "I
don't know," said his Majesty, "why you will not let me part with
an old deaf woman, of whom I am weary."

Her credit had always been extremely limited by the Queen's
superior influence, and by the devotion of the minister to her
Majesty.  Except a barony, a red riband, and a good place for her
brother, Lady Suffolk could succeed but in very subordinate
recommendations.  Her own acquisitions were so moderate, that,
besides Marble Hill, which cost the King ten or twelve thousand
pounds, her complaisance had not been too dearly purchased.  She
left the court with an income so little to be envied, that,
though an economist and not expensive, by the lapse of some
annuities on lives not so prolonged as her own she found herself
straitened; and, besides Marble Hill, did not at most leave
twenty thousand pounds to her family.  On quitting court, she
married Mr. George Berkeley, and outlived him. (113)

No established mistress of a sovereign ever enjoyed less of the
brilliancy of the situation than Lady Suffolk.  Watched and
thwarted by the Queen, disclaimed by the minister, she owed to
the dignity of her own behaviour, and to the contradiction of
their enemies, the chief respect that was paid to her, and which
but ill compensated for the slavery of her attendance, and the
mortifications she endured.  She was elegant; her lover the
reverse, and most unentertaining, and void of confidence in her.
His motions too were measured by etiquette and the clock.  He
visited her every evening at nine; but with such dull
punctuality, that he frequently walked about his chamber for ten
minutes with his watch in his hand, if the stated minute was not
arrived.

But from the Queen she tasted yet more positive vexations.  Till
she became Countess of Suffolk, she constantly dressed the
Queen's bead, who delighted in subjecting her to such servile
offices, though always apologizing to her good Howard.  Often her
Majesty had more complete triumph.  It happened more than once,
that the King, coming into the room while the Queen was dressing,
has snatched off the handkerchief, and, turning rudely to Mrs.
Howard, has cried, "Because you have an ugly neck yourself, you
hide the Queen's."

It is certain that the King always preferred the Queen's person
to that of any other woman; nor ever described his idea of
beauty, but he drew the picture of his wife.

Queen Caroline is said to have been very handsome at her
marriage, soon after which she had the small-pox; but was little
marked by it, and retained a most pleasing countenance.  It was
full of majesty or mildness as she pleased, and her penetrating
eyes expressed whatever she had a mind they should.  Her voice
too was captivating, and her hands beautifully small, plump, and
graceful.  Her understanding was uncommonly strong; and so was
her resolution.  From their earliest connexion she had determined
to govern the King, and deserved to do so; for her submission to
his will was unbounded, her sense much superior, and his honour
and interest always took place of her own: so that her love of
power that was predominant, was dearly bought, and rarely ill
employed.  She was ambitious too of fame; but, shackled by her
devotion to the King, she seldom could pursue that object.  She
wished to be a patroness of learned men but George had no respect
for them or their works; and her Majesty's own taste was not very
exquisite, nor did he allow her time to cultivate any studies.
Her Generosity would have displayed itself, for she valued money
but as the instrument of her good purposes: but he stinted her
alike in almost all her passions; and though she wished for
nothing more than to be liberal, she bore the imputation of his
avarice, as she did of others of his faults.  Often, when she had
made prudent and proper promises of preferment, and could not
persuade the King to comply, she suffered the breach of word to
fall on her, rather than reflect on him.  Though his affection
and confidence in her were implicit, he lived in dread of being
supposed to be governed by her; and that silly parade was
extended even to the most private moments of business with my
father.  Whenever he entered, the Queen rose, courtesied, and
retired or offered to retire.  Sometimes the King condescended to
bid her stay-on both occasions she and Sir Robert. had previously
settled the business to be discussed.  Sometimes the King would
quash the proposal in question, and yield after retalking it over
with her-but then he boasted to Sir Robert that he himself had
better considered it.

One of the Queen's delights was the improvement of the garden at
Richmond; and the King believed she paid for all with her own
money-nor would he ever look at her intended plans, saying he did
not care how she flung away her own revenue.  He little suspected
the aids Sir Robert furnished to her from the treasury.  When she
died, she was indebted twenty thousand pounds to the King.

Her learning I have said was superficial; her knowledge of
languages as little accurate.  The King, with a bluff Westphalian
accent, spoke English correctly.  The Queen's chief study was
divinity, and she had rather weakened her faith than enlightened
it.  She was at least not orthodox; and her confidante, Lady
Sundon, an absurd and pompous simpleton, swayed her countenance
towards the less-believing clergy.  The Queen, however, was so
sincere at her death, that when Archbishop Potter was to
administer the sacrament to her, she declined taking it, very few
persons being in the room.  When the prelate retired, the
courtiers in the ante-room crowded round him, crying, "My lord,
has the queen received?"  His grace artfully eluded the question,
only saying most devoutly , "Her Majesty was in a heavenly
disposition"-and the truth escaped the public.

She suffered more unjustly by declining to see her son, the
Prince of Wales, to whom she sent her blessing and forgiveness;
but conceiving the extreme distress it would lay on the King,
should he thus be forced to forgive so impenitent a son, or to
banish him again if once recalled, she heroically preferred a
meritorious husband to a worthless child.

The Queen's greatest error was too high an opinion of her own
address and art; she imagined that all who did not dare to
contradict her were imposed upon; and she had the additional
weakness of thinking that she could play off @any persons without
being discovered.  That mistaken humour, and at other times her
hazarding very offensive truths, made her many enemies; and her
duplicity in fomenting jealousies between the ministers, that
each might be more dependent on herself, was no sound wisdom.  It
was the Queen who blew into a flame the ill-blood between Sir
Robert Walpole and his brother-in-law, Lord Townshend.  Yet
though she disliked some of the cabinet, she never let her own
prejudices disturb the King's affairs, provided the obnoxious
paid no court to the mistress.  Lord Islay was the only man, who,
by managing Scotland for Sir Robert Walpole, was maintained by
him in spite of his attachment to Lady Suffolk.

The Queen's great secret was her own rupture, which, till her
last illness, nobody knew but the King, her German nurse, Mrs.
Mailborne, and one other person.  To prevent all suspicion, her
Majesty would frequently stand some minutes in her shift talking
to her ladies (114) and though labouring with so dangerous a
complaint, she made it so invariable a rule never to refuse a
desire of the King, that every morning at Richmond she walked
several miles with him; and more than once, when she had the gout
in her foot, she dipped her whole leg in cold water to be ready
to attend him.  The pain, her bulk, and the exercise, threw her
into such fits of perspiration as vented the gout; but those
exertions hastened the crisis of her distemper.  It was great
shrewdness in Sir Robert Walpole, who, before her distemper broke
out, discovered her secret.  On my mother's death, who was of the
Queen's age, her Majesty asked Sir Robert many physical
questions; but he remarked that she oftenest reverted to a
rupture, which had not been the illness of his wife.  When he
came home, he said to me, "Now, Horace, I know by possession of
what secret Lady Sundon (115)has preserved such an ascendant over
the Queen." He was in the right.  How Lady Sundon had wormed
herself into that mystery was never known.  As Sir Robert
maintained his influence over the clergy by Gibson, Bishop of
London, he often met with troublesome obstructions from Lady
Sundon, who espoused, as I have said, the heterodox clergy; and
Sir Robert could never shake her credit.

Yet the Queen was constant in her protection of Sir Robert, and
the day before she died gave a strong mark of her conviction that
he was the firmest supporter the King had.  As they two alone
were standing by the Queen's bed, she pathetically recommended,
not the minister to the sovereign, but the master to the servant.
Sir Robert was alarmed, and feared the recommendation would leave
a fatal impression; but a short time after, the King reading with
Sir Robert some intercepted letters from Germany, which said that
now the Queen was 'gone, Sir Robert would have no protection: "On
the contrary," said the King, "you know she recommended me to
you."  This marked the notice he had taken of the expression; and
it was the only notice he ever took of it: nay, his Majesty's
grief was so excessive and so sincere, that his kindness to his
minister seemed to increase for the Queen's sake.

The Queen's dread of a rival was a feminine weakness; the
behaviour of her elder son was a real thorn.  He early displayed
his aversion to his mother, who perhaps assumed too much at
first; yet it is certain that her good sense, and the interest of
her family, would have prevented, if possible, the mutual dislike
of the father and son, and their reciprocal contempt.  As the
Opposition gave into all adulation towards the Prince, his
ill-poised head and vanity swallowed all their incense.  He even
early after his arrival had listened to a high act of
disobedience.  Money he soon wanted: old Sarah, Duchess of
Marlborough, (116) e ever proud and ever malignant, was persuaded
to offer her favourite Granddaughter, Lady Diana Spencer,
afterwards Duchess of Bedford, to the Prince of' Wales, with a
fortune of a hundred thousand pounds.  He accepted the proposal,
and the day was fixed for their being secretly married at the
Duchess's lodge in the Great park at Windsor.  Sir Robert Walpole
got intelligence of the project, prevented it, and the secret was
buried in silence.

Youth, folly, and indiscretion, the beauty of the young lady, and
a large sum of ready money, might have offered something like a
plea for so rash a marriage, had it taken place; but what could
excuse, what indeed could provoke, the senseless and barbarous
insult offered to the King and Queen, by Frederick's taking his
wife out of the palace of Hampton Court in the middle of the
night, when she was in actual labour, and carrying her, at the
imminent risk of the lives of her and the child, to the unaired
palace and bed at St. James's?  Had he no way of affronting his
parents but by venturing to kill his wife and the heir of the
crown? A baby that wounds itself to vex its nurse is no more void
of reflection.  The scene which commenced by unfeeling idiotism
closed with paltry hypocrisy.  The Queen on the first notice of
her son's exploits, set out for St. James's to visit the Princess
by seven in the morning.  The gracious Prince, so far from
attempting an apology, spoke not a word to his mother; but on her
retreat gave her his hand, led her into the street to her
coach-still dumb!-but a crowd being assembled at the gate, he
kneeled down in the dirt, and humbly kissed her Majesty's hand.
Her indignation must have shrunk into contempt.

After the death of the Queen, Lady Yarmouth (117) came over, who
had been the King's mistress at Hanover during his latter
journeys-and with the Queen's privity, for he always made her the
of his amours; which made Mrs. Selwyn once tell him, he should be
the last man with whom she would have an intrigue, for she knew
he would tell the Queen.  In his letters to the latter from
Hanover, he said, "You must love the Walmoden, for she loves me."
She was created a countess, and had much weight with him; but
never employed her credit but to assist his ministers, or to
convert some honours and favours to her own advantage.  She had
two sons, who both bore her husband's name; but the younger,
though never acknowledged, was supposed the King's, and
consequently did not miss additional homage from the courtiers.
That incense being one of the recommendations to the countenance
of Lady Yarmouth, drew Lord Chesterfield into a ridiculous
distress.  On his being made secretary of state, be found a fair
young lad in the antechamber at St. James's, -who seeming much at
home, the earl, concluding it was the mistress's son, was profuse
of attentions to the boy, and more prodigal still of his
prodigious regard for his mamma.  The shrewd boy received all his
lordship's vows with indulgence, and without betraying himself:
at last he said, "I suppose your lordship takes me for Master
Louis; but I am only Sir William Russel, one of the pages."

The King's last years passed as regularly as clockwork.  At nine
at night he had cards in the apartment of his daughters, the
Princesses Amelia and Caroline, with Lady Yarmouth, two or three
of the late Queen's ladies, and as many of the most favoured
officers of his own household.  Every Saturday in summer he
carried that uniform party, but without his daughters, to dine at
Richmond: they went in coaches and six in the middle of the day ,
with the heavy horse-guards kicking up the dust before
them-dined, walked an hour in the garden, returned in the same
dusty parade; and his Majesty fancied himself the most gallant
and lively prince in Europe.

His last year was glorious and triumphant beyond example; and his
death was most felicitous to himself, being without a Pang,
without tasting a reverse, and when his sight and hearing were so
nearly extinguished that any prolongation could but have swelled
to calamities. (118)

(105) She is thus described in a ballad, made upon the quarrel
between George the First and the Prince of Wales, at the
christening recorded at p. 83 when the Prince and all his
household were ordered to quit St. James's:-

"But Bellenden we needs must praise,
Who, as down the stairs she jumps,
Sings over the hills and far away,
Despising doleful dumps."-E.

(106) Colonel John Campbell succeeded to the dukedom in 1761:
Mrs. Campbell died in 1736.  She was the mother of the fifth Duke
of Argyle and three other sons, and of Lady Caroline, who
married, first, the Earl of Aylesbury, and, secondly, Walpole's
bosom friend, Marshal Conway.-E.

(107) "The letter which Walpole alludes to," says Mr. Croker, "is
in existence.  It is not a letter from Mr. Howard to his lady,
but from the Archbishop to the Princess; and although his grace
urges a compliance with Mr. Howard's demand of the restoration of
his wife, he treats it not as a matter between them, but as an
attack on the Princess herself, whom the Archbishop considers as
the direct protectress of Mrs. Howard, and the immediate cause of
her resistance.  So that in this letter at least there is no
ground for imputing to Mrs. Howard any rivalry with the Princess,
or to the Princess any malicious jealousy of Mrs. Howard." Vol.
i. p. xiv.-E.

(108) Mr. Croker asserts, that "neither in Mrs. Howard's
correspondence with the King, nor in the notes of her
conversation with the Queen, nor in any of her most confidential
papers, has he found a single trace of the feeling which Walpole
so confidently imputes."  Upon this assertion, Sir Walter Scott,
in a review of the Suffolk Correspondence, pleasantly
remarks,-"We regret that the editor's researches have not enabled
him to state, whether it is true that the restive husband sold
his own noisy honour and the possession of his lady for a pension
of twelve hundred a-year.  For our own parts, without believing
all Walpole's details, we substantially agree in his opinion,
that the King's friendship was by no means Platonic or refined;
but that the Queen and Mrs. Howard, by mutual forbearance, good
sense, and decency, contrived to diminish the scandal: after all,
the question has no great interest for the present generation,
since scandal is only valued when fresh, and the public have
generally enough of that poignant fare, without ripping up the
frailties of their grandmothers."  Sir Walter sums up his notice
of the inaccuracies occurring in these Reminiscences, with the
following just and considerate reflection: "When it is
recollected that the noble owner of Strawberry Hill was speaking
of very remote events, which he reported on hearsay, and that
hearsay of old standing, such errors are scarcely to be wondered
at, particularly when they are found to correspond with the
partialities and prejudices of the narrator.  These,
strengthening as we grow older, gradually pervert or at least
alter, the accuracy of our recollections, until they assimilate
them to our feelings, while,

"As beams of warm imagination play,
The memory's faint traces melt away.
See Prose Works, vol. xix. p. 201.-E.

(109) Pope alludes to this personal defect in his lines "On a
certain Lady at court:"

"I know a thing that's most uncommon;
(Envy be silent, and attend!)
I know a reasonable woman,
handsome and witty, yet a friend.
Not warp'd by passion, awed by rumour;
Not grave through pride, or gay through folly--
An equal mixture of good humour
And sensible, soft melancholy.
'Has she no faults then,' (Envy says,) 'Sir?'
'Yes, she has one, I must aver;
When all the world conspires to praise her--
The woman's deaf, and does not hear.'"-E.

(110) The same thing has happened to me by books.  A passage
lately read has recalled some other formerly perused; and both
together have opened to me, or cleared up some third fact, which
neither separately would have expounded.

(111) Lady Suffolk died in July, 1767.-E.

(112) Lady Suffolk was early affected with deafness.  Cheselden,
the surgeon, then in favour at court, persuaded her that he had
hopes of being able to cure deafness by some operation on the
drum of the ear, and offered to try the experiment on a condemned
convict then in Newgate, who was deaf.  If the man could be
pardoned, he would try it; and, if he succeeded, would practise
the same cure on her ladyship.  She obtained the man's pardon,
who was cousin to Cheselden, who had feigned that pretended
discovery to save his relation-and no more was heard of the
experiment.  The man saved his ear too-but Cheselden was
disgraced at court.

(113) Lady Suffolk formally retired from court in 1734, and in
the following year married the Honourable George Berkeley,
youngest son of the second Earl of Berkeley.  He was Master of
St. Catherine's, in the Tower, and had served in two parliaments
as member for Dover.  He died in 1746.-E.

(114) While the Queen dressed, prayers used to be read in the
outward room, where hung a naked Venus.  Mrs. Selwyn,
bedchamber-woman in waiting, was one day ordered to bid the
chaplain, Dr. Maddox, afterwards Bishop of Worcester, begin the
service.  He said archly, "And a very proper altar-piece is here,
Madam!"  Queen Anne had the same custom; and once ordering the
door to be shut while she shifted, the chaplain stopped.  The
Queen sent to ask why he did not proceed.  He replied, "he would
not whistle the word of God through the keyhole."

(115) Mrs. Clayton, wife of Robert Clayton, Esq. of the Treasury,
bedchamber-woman to the Queen.  This lady, who had the art to
procure her husband to be created Lord Sundon, possessed over her
royal mistress an influence of which even Sir Robert Walpole was
jealous.-E.

(116) That woman, who had risen to greatness and independent
wealth by the weakness of another Queen, forgot, like Duc
d'Epernon, her own unmerited exultation, and affected to brave
successive courts, though sprung from the dregs of one.  When the
Prince of Orange came over to marry the Princess Royal, Anne, a
boarded gallery with a penthouse roof was erected for the
procession from the windows of the great drawing-room at St.
James's cross the garden to the Lutheran chapel in the friary.
The Prince being indisposed, and going to Bath, the marriage was
deferred for some weeks, and the boarded gallery remained,
darkening the windows of Marlborough House.  The Duchess cried,
"I wonder when my neighbour George will take away his
orange-chest!"--which it did resemble.  She did not want that
sort of wit,* which ill-temper, long knowledge of the world, and
insolence can sharpen-and envying the favour which she no longer
possessed, Sir R. Walpole was often the object of her satire.
Yet her great friend, Lord Godolphin, the treasurer, had enjoined
her to preserve very different sentiments.  The Duchess and my
father and mother were standing by the Earl's bed at St. Albans
as he was dying.  Taking Sir Robert by the hand, Lord Godolphin
turned to the Duchess, and said, "Madam, should 'you ever desert
this young man, and there should be a possibility of returning
from the grave, I shall certainly appear to you." Her grace did
not believe in spirits.

* Baron Gleicken, minister from Denmark to France, being at Paris
soon after the King his master had been there, and a French lady
being so ill-bred as to begin censuring the King to him, saying,
"Ah! Monsieur, c'est une t`ete!"-"Couronn`ee," replied he
instantly, stopping her by so gentle a hint.

(117) Amelia Sophia, wife of the Baron de Walmoden, Created
Countess of Yarmouth in 1739.

(118) For an interesting account of the death of George the
Second, on the 24th of October, 1760, and also of his funeral in
Westminster Abbey, see Walpole's letters to Mr. Montagu on the
25th of that month, and of the 13th of November.-E.



                               CHAPTER VIII.


George the Second's Daughters-Anne, Princess of Orange-Princess
Amelia-Princess Caroline-Lord Hervey-Duke of Cumberland.

I am tempted to drain my memory of all its rubbish, and will set
down a few more of my recollections, but with less method than I
have used in the foregoing pages.

I have said little or nothing of the King's two unmarried
daughters.  Though they lived in the palace with him, he never
admitted them to any share in his politics; and if any of the
ministers paid them the compliment of seeming attachment, it was
more for the air than for the reality.  The Princess Royal, Anne,
married in Holland, was of a most imperious and ambitious nature;
and on her mother's death, hoping to succeed to her credit, came
to Holland on pretence of ill health; but the King, aware of her
plan, Was so offended that he sent her to Bath as soon as she
arrived, and as peremptorily back to Holland-I think, without
suffering her to pass two nights in London.

Princess Amelia, as well disposed to meddle, was confined to
receiving court from the Duke of Newcastle, who affected to be in
love with her; and from the Duke of Grafton, in whose connexion
with her there was more reality.

Princess Caroline, one of the most excellent of women, was
devoted to the Queen, who, as well as the King, had such
confidence in her veracity, that on any disagreement among their
children, they said, "Stay, send for Caroline, and then we shall
know the truth."

The memorable Lord Hervey had dedicated himself to the Queen, and
certainly towards her death had gained great ascendance with her.
She had made him privy-seal; and as he took care to keep as well
with Sir Robert Walpole, no man stood in a more prosperous light.


But Lord Hervey, who handled all the weapons of a court, (119)
had also made a deep impression on the heart of the virtuous
Princess Caroline; and as there was a mortal antipathy between
the Duke of Grafton and Lord Hervey, the court was often on the
point of being disturbed by the enmity of the favourites of the
two Princesses.  The death of the Queen deeply affected her
daughter Caroline; and the change of the ministry four years
after, dislodged Lord Hervey whom for the Queen's sake the King
would have saved, and who very ungratefully satirized the King in
a ballad, as if he had sacrificed him voluntarily.
Disappointment, rage, and a distempered constitution carried Lord
Hervey off, and overwhelmed his Princess - she never appeared in
public after the Queen's death; and, being dreadfully afflicted
with the rheumatism, never stirred out of her apartment, and
rejoiced at her own dissolution some years before her father.

Her sister Amelia leagued herself with the Bedford faction during
the latter part of her father's life.  When he died, she
established herself respectably; but enjoying no favour with her
nephew, and hating the Princess-dowager, she made a plea of her
deafness, and soon totally abstained from St. James's.

The Duke of Cumberland, never, or very rarely, interfered in
politics.  Power he would have liked, but never seemed to court
it.  His passion would have been to command the army, and he
would, I doubt, have been too ready to aggrandize the crown by
it: but successive disgusts weaned his mind from all pursuits,
and the grandeur of his sense, (120) and philosophy made him
indifferent to a world that had disappointed all his views.  The
unpopularity which the Scotch and Jacobites spread against him
for his merit in suppressing the rebellion, his brother's
jealousy, and the contempt he himself felt for the Prince, his
own ill success in his battles abroad, and his father's
treacherous sacrifice of him on the convention of Closterseven,
the dereliction of his two political friends, Lord Holland and
Lord Sandwich, and the rebuffing spite of the Princess-dowager;
all those mortifications centring on a constitution evidently
tending to dissolution, made him totally neglect himself, and
ready to shake off being, as an encumbrance not worth the
attention of a superior understanding.

>From the time the Duke first appeared on the stage of the public,
all his father's ministers had been blind to his Royal Highness's
capacity, or were afraid of it.  Lord Granville, too giddy
himself to sound a young Prince, had treated him arrogantly when
the King and the Earl had projected a match for him with the
Princess of Denmark.  The Duke, accustomed by the Queen and his
governor, Mr. Poyntz, to venerate the wisdom of Sir Robert
Walpole, then on his death-bed, sent Mr. Poyntz, the day but one
before Sir Robert expired, to consult him how to avoid the match.
Sir Robert advised his Royal Highness to stipulate for an ample
settlement.  The Duke took the sage counsel, and heard no more of
his intended bride.

The low ambition of Lord Hardwicke, the childish passion for
power of the Duke of Newcastle, and the peevish jealousy of Mr.
Pelham, combined on the death of the Prince of Wales, to exclude
the Duke of Cumberland from the regency (in case of minority,)
and to make them flatter themselves that they should gain the
favour of the Princess-dowager by cheating her with the semblance
of power.  The Duke resented the slight, but scorned to make any
claim.  The Princess never forgave the insidious homage; and, in
concurrence with Lord Bute, totally estranged the affection of
the young King from his uncle, nor allowed him a shadow of
influence.

(119) He had broken with Frederick, Prince of Wales, on having
shared the favours of his mistress, Miss Vane, one of the Queen's
maids of honour.  When she fell in labour at St. James's, and was
delivered of a son, which she ascribed to the Prince, Lord Hervey
and Lord Harrington each told Sir Robert Walpole that he believed
himself father of the child.

(120) the Duke, in his very childhood, gave a mark of his sense
and firmness.  He had displeased the Queen, an(f she sent him up
to his chamber.  When he appeared again, he was sullen.
"William," said the Queen, "what have you been doing?"--
"Reading."--"Reading what?"--"The Bible."--"And what did you read
there?"--"About Jesus and Mary.=--"And what about them?"--"Why,
that Jesus said to Mary, Woman! what hast thou to do with me?"



                                CHAPTER IX.


Anecdotes of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough-and of Catherine
Duchess of Buckingham.

I have done with royal personages: shall I add a codicil on some
remarkable characters that I remember? As I am writing for young
ladies, I have chiefly dwelt on heroines of your own sex; they,
too, shall compose my last chapter: enter the Duchesses of
Marlborough and Buckingham.

Those two women were considerable personages in their day.  The
first, her own beauty, the superior talents of her husband in
war, and the caprice of a feeble princess, raised to the highest
pitch of power; and the prodigious wealth bequeathed to her by
her lord, and accumulated in concert with her, gave her weight in
a free country.  The other, proud of royal, though illegitimate
birth, was, from the vanity of that birth, so zealously attached
to her expelled brother, the Pretender, that she never ceased
labouring to effect his restoration; and, as the opposition to
the House of Brunswick was composed partly of principled
Jacobites-of Tories, who either knew not what their own
principles were, or dissembled them to themselves, and of Whigs,
who, from hatred of the minister, both acted in concert with the
Jacobites and rejoiced in their assistance-two women of such
wealth, rank, and enmity to the court, were sure of great
attention from all the discontented.

The beauty of the Duchess of Marlborough had always been of the
scornful and imperious kind, and her features and air announced
nothing that her temper did not confirm; both together, her
beauty and temper, enslaved her heroic lord.  One of her
principal charms was a prodigious abundance of fine fair hair.
One day at her toilet, in anger to him, she cut off those
commanding tresses, and flung them in his face.  Nor did her
insolence stop there, nor stop till it had totally estranged and
worn out the patience of the poor Queen, her mistress.  The
Duchess was often seen to give her Majesty her fan and gloves,
and turn away her own head, as if the Queen had offensive smells.

Incapable of due respect to superiors, it was no wonder she
treated her children and inferiors with supercilious contempt.
Her eldest daughter (121) and she were long at variance, and
never reconciled.  When the young Duchess exposed herself by
placing a monument and silly epitaph, of her own composition and
bad spelling, to Congreve, in Westminster Abbey, her mother,
quoting the words, said, "I know not what pleasure she might have
in his company, but I am sure it was no honour."(122)  With her
youngest daughter, the Duchess of Montagu, old Sarah agreed as
ill.  "I wonder," said the Duke of Marlborough to them, "that you
cannot agree, you are so alike!"  Of her granddaughter, the
Duchess of Manchester, daughter of the Duchess of Montagu, she
affected to be fond.  One day she said to her, "Duchess of
Manchester, you are a good creature, and I love you mightily-but
you have a mother!"-"And she has a mother!" answered the Duchess
of Manchester, who was all spirit, justice, and honour, and could
not suppress sudden truth.

One of old Marlborough's capital mortifications sprang from a
granddaughter.  The most beautiful of her four charming
daughters, Lady Sunderland,(123) left two sons,(124) the second
Duke of Marlborough, and John Spencer, who became her heir, and
Anne Lady Bateman, and Lady Diana Spencer, whom I have mentioned,
and who became Duchess of Bedford.  The Duke and his brother, to
humour their grandmother, were in opposition, though the eldest
she never loved.  He had good sense, infinite generosity, and not
more economy than was to be expected from a young man of warm
passions and such vast expectations.  He was modest and diffident
too, but could not digest total dependence on a capricious and
avaricious grandmother.  HIS sister, Lady Bateman, had the
intriguing spirit of her father and grandfather, Earls of
Sunderland.  She was connected with Henry Fox, the first Lord
Holland, and both had great influence over the Duke of
Marlborough.  What an object would it be to Fox to convert to the
court so great a subject as the Duke! Nor was it much less
important to his sister to give him a wife, who, with no reasons
for expectation of such shining fortune, should owe the
obligation to her.  Lady Bateman struck the first stroke, and
persuaded her brother to marry a handsome young lady, who,
unluckily, was daughter of Lord Trevor, who had been a bitter
enemy to his grandfather, the victorious Duke.  The grandam's
rage exceeded all bounds.  Having a portrait of Lady Bateman, she
blackened the face, and wrote on it, "Now her outside is as black
as her inside." The duke she turned out of the little lodge in
Windsor Park; and then pretending that the new Duchess and her
female cousins (eight Trevors) had stripped the house and
gardens, she had a puppet-show made with waxen figures,
representing the Trevors tearing up the shrubs, and the Duchess
carrying off the chicken-coop under her arm.

Her fury did but increase when Mr. Fox prevailed on the Duke to
go over to the court.  With her coarse intemperate humour, she
said, "that was the Fox that had stolen her goose."  Repeated
injuries at last drove the Duke to go to law with her.  Fearing
that even no lawyer would come up to the Billingsgate with which
she was animated herself, she appeared in the court of justice,
and with some wit and infinite abuse, treated the laughing public
with the spectacle of a woman who had held the reigns of empire,
metamorphosed into the widow Black-acre.  Her grandson, in his
suit, demanded a sword set with diamonds, given to his grandsire
by the Emperor. "I retained it," said the beldam, " lest he
should pick out the diamonds and pawn them."

I will repeat but one more instance of her insolent asperity,
which produced an admirable reply of the famous Lady Mary
-Wortley Montague.  Lady Sundon had received a pair of diamond
ear-rings as a bribe for procuring a considerable post in Queen
Caroline's family for a certain peer; and, decked with those
jewels, paid a visit to the old Duchess; who, as soon as she was
gone, said, "What an impudent creature, to come hither with her
bribe in her ear!"  "Madam," replied Lady Mary Wortley, who was
present, "how should people know where wine' is sold, unless a
bush is hung out?"

The Duchess of Buckingham was as much elated by owing her birth
to James II.(125) as the Marlborough was by the favour of his
daughter.  Lady Dorchester,(126) the mother of the former,
endeavoured to curb that pride, and, one should have thought,
took an effectual method, though one few mothers would have
practised.  "You need not be so vain," said the old profligate,
"for you are not the King's daughter, but Colonel Graham's."
Graham was a fashionable man of those days and noted for dry
humour.  His legitimate daughter, the Countess of Berkshire, was
extremely like to the Duchess of Buckingham: "Well! well!" said
Graham, "Kings are all powerful, and one must not complain; but
certainly the same man begot those two women."  To discredit the
wit of both parents, the Duchess never ceased labouring to
restore the House of Stuart, and to mark her filial devotion to
it.  Frequent were her journeys to the Continent for that
purpose.  She always stopped at Paris, visited the church where
lay the unburied body of James, and wept over it.  A poor
Benedictine of the convent, observing her filial piety, took
notice to her grace that the velvet pall that covered the coffin
was become threadbare-and so it remained.

Finding all her efforts fruitless, and perhaps aware that her
plots were not undiscovered by Sir Robert Walpole, who was
remarkable for his intelligence, she made an artful double, and
resolved to try what might be done through him himself.  I forget
how she contracted an acquaintance with him: I do remember that
more than once he received letters from the Pretender himself,
which probably were transmitted through her.  Sir Robert always
carried them to George II. who endorsed and returned them.  That
negotiation not succeeding. the Duchess made a more home push.
Learning his extreme fondness for his daughter, (afterwards Lady
Mary Churchill,) she sent for Sir Robert, and asked him if he
recollected what had not been thought too great a reward to Lord
Clarendon for restoring the royal family? He affected not to
understand her. "Was not he allowed," urged the zealous Duchess,
"to match his daughter to the Duke of York?" Sir Robert smiled,
and left her.

Sir Robert being forced from court, the Duchess thought the
moment (127) favourable, and took a new journey to Rome; but
conscious of the danger she might run of discovery, she made over
her estate to the famous Mr. Pulteney (afterwards Earl of Bath),
and left the deed in his custody.  What was her astonishment,
when on her return she redemanded the instrument!-It was
mislaid-he could not find it-he never could find it! The Duchess
grew clamorous.  At last his friend Lord Mansfield told him
plainly,- he could never show his face unless he satisfied the
Duchess.  Lord Bath did then sign a release to her of her estate.
The transaction was recorded in print by Sir Charles Hanbury
Williams, in a pamphlet that had great vogue, called a
Congratulatory Letter, with many other anecdotes of the same
personage, and was not less acute than Sir Charles's Odes on the
same here.  The Duchess dying not long after Sir Robert's
entrance into the House of Lords, Lord Oxford, one of her
executors, told him there, that the Duchess had struck Lord Bath
out of her will, and made him, Sir Robert, one of her trustees in
his room. "Then," said Sir Robert, laughing, @ I see, my lord,
that I have got Lord Bath's place before he has got mine." Sir
Robert had artfully prevented the last.  Before he quitted the
King, he persuaded his Majesty to insist, as a preliminary to the
change, that Mr. Pulteney should go into the House of Peers, his
great credit lying in the other house; and I remember my father's
action when he returned from court and told me what he had
done-,, I have turned the key of the closet on him,"-making that
motion with his hand.  Pulteney had jumped at the proffered
earldom, but saw his error when too late; and was so enraged at
his own oversight, that, when he went to take the oaths in the
House of Lords, he dashed his patent on the floor, and vowed he
would never take it up-but he had kissed the King's hand for it,
and it was too late to recede.

But though Madam of Buckingham could not effect a coronation to
her will, she indulged her pompous mind with such puppet-shows as
were appropriate to her rank.  She had made a funeral for her
husband as splendid as that of the great Marlborough: she renewed
that pageant for her only son, a weak lad, who died under age;
and for herself; and prepared and decorated -waxen dolls of him
and of herself to be exhibited in glass-cases in Westminster
Abbey.  It was for the
procession at her son's burial that she wrote to old Sarah of
Marlborough to borrow the triumphal car that had transported the
corpse of the Duke. "It carried my Lord Marlborough," replied the
other, and shall never be used for any body else."  "I have
consulted the undertaker," replied the Buckingham, and he tells
me I may have a finer for twenty pounds."

One of the last acts of Buckingham's life was marrying a grandson
she had to a daughter of Lord Hervey.  That intriguing man, sore,
as I have said, at his disgrace, cast his eyes every where to
revenge or exalt himself.  Professions or recantations of any
principles cost him nothing: at least the consecrated day which
was appointed for his first interview with the Duchess made it
presumed, that to obtain her wealth, with her grandson for his
daughter, he must have
sworn fealty to the House of Stuart.  It was on the martyrdom of
her grandfather: she received him in the great drawing-room of
Buckingham House, seated in a chair of state, in deep mourning,
attended by her women in like weeds, in memory of the royal
martyr.

It will be a proper close to the history of those curious ladies
to mention the anecdote of Pope relative to them.  Having drawn
his famous character of Atossa, he communicated it to each
Duchess, pretending it was levelled at the other.  The Buckingham
believed him: the Marlborough had more sense, and knew herself,
and gave him a thousand pounds to suppress it;-and yet he left
the copy behind him!(128)

Bishop Burnet, from absence of mind, had drawn as strong a
picture of herself to the Duchess of Marlborough, as Pope did
under covert of another lady.  Dining with the Duchess after the
Duke's disgrace, Burnet was comparing him to Belisarius: "But
how," said she, "could so great a general be so abandoned?" "Oh!
Madam," said the Bishop, "do not you know what a brimstone of a
wife he had'!"

Perhaps you know this anecdote, and perhaps several others that I
have been relating.  No matter; they will go under the article of
my dotage-and very properly-I began with tales of my nursery, and
prove that I have been writing in my second childhood.

H. W. January 13th, 1789.

(121) The Lady Henrietta, married to Lord Godolphin, who, by act
of Parliament, succeeded as Duchess of Marlborough.  She died in
1738, childless; and the issue of her next sister, Lady
Sunderland, succeeded to the duchy of Marlborough.-E.

(122) "For reasons," says Dr.  Johnson, "either not known, or not
mentioned, Congreve bequeathed a legacy of about ten thousand
pounds to the Duchess; the accumulation of attentive parsimony,
which, though to her superfluous and useless, might have given
great assistance to the ancient family from which he descended,
at that time, by the imprudence of his relation, reduced to
difficulties and distress."-E.

(123) Lady Sunderland was a great politician; and having, like
her mother, a most beautiful head of hair, used, while combing it
at her toilet, to receive men whose votes or interests she wished
to influence.

(124) She had an elder son, who died young, while only Earl of
Sunderland.  He had parts, and all the ambition of his parents
and of his family (which his younger brother had not); but George
II. had conceived such an aversion to his father, that he would
not employ him.  The young Earl at last asked Sir Robert Walpole
for an ensigncy in the Guards.  The minister, astonished at so
humble a request from a man of such consequence, expressed his
surprise.  "I ask it," said the young lord, "to ascertain whether
it is determined that I shall never have any thing." He died soon
after at Paris.

(125) By Catherine Sedley, created by her royal lover Countess of
Dorchester for life.-E.

(126) Lady Dorchester is well known for her wit, and for saying
that she wondered for what James chose his mistresses: "We are
none of us handsome," said she; "and if we have wit, he has not
enough to find it out." But I do not know whether it is as
public, that her style was gross and shameless.  Meeting the
Duchess of Portsmouth and Lady Orkney, the favourite of King
William, at the drawing-room of George the First, "God!" said
she, "who would have thought that we three whores should have met
here?"  Having, after the King's abdication, married Sir David
Collyer, by whom she had two sons, she said to them, " If any
body should call you sons of a whore, you must bear it; for you
are so: but if they call you bastards, fight till you die; for
you are an honest man's sons." Susan, Lady Bellasis, another of
King James's mistresses, had wit too, and no beauty.  Mrs.
Godfrey had neither.  Grammont has recorded why she was chosen.

(127) I am not quite certain that, writing by memory at the
distance of fifty years, I place that journey exactly at the
right period, nor whether it did not take place before Sir
Robert's fall.  Nothing material depends on the precise period.

(128) The story is thus told by Dr. Warton:-" These lines were
shown to her grace, as if they were intended for the portrait of
the Duchess of Buckingham; but she soon stopped the person who
was reading them to her, as the Duchess of Portland informed me,
and called out aloud, "I cannot be so imposed upon; I see plainly
enough for whom they are designed;" and abused Pope most
plentifully on the subject: though she was afterwards reconciled
to him, and courted him, and gave him a thousand pounds to
suppress this portrait, which he a accepted, it is said, by the
persuasion of Mrs. M. Blount; and, after the Duchess's death, it
was printed in a folio sheet, 1746, and afterwards inserted in
his Moral Essays.  This is the greatest blemish on our poet's
moral character."-E.



The following extracts from Letters of Sarah, Duchess of
Marlborough, were copied by me from the original letters
addressed to the Earl of Stair, left by him to Sir David
Dalrymple, his near relative, and lent to me by Sir David's
brother, Mr. Alexander Dalrymple, long employed as Geographer in
the service of the East India company.  They formed part of a
large volume of ms. letters, chiefly from the same person.

The Duchess of Marlborough's virulence, her prejudices, her style
of writing, are already well known, and every line of these
extracts will only serve to confirm the same opinion of all
three.  But it will, probably, be thought curious thus to be able
to compare the notes of the opposite political parties, and their
different account of the same trifling facts, magnified by the
prejudices of both into affairs of importance.

London, Feb. 24th, 1738.
. . . . As to Norfolk House, (129) I have heard there is a great
deal of company, and that the Princess of Wales, tho' so very
young, behaves so as to please every body; and I think her
conversation is much more proper and decent for a drawing-room
than the wise queen Caroline's was, who never was half an hour
without saying something shocking to some body or other, even
when she intended to oblige, and generally very improper
discourse for a public room.

I received the favour of yours of the 17th December yesterday.  I
have nothing material to say to you since my last.  His Majesty
saw the Queen's women servants first, which was a very mournful
sight, for they all cried extremely; and his Majesty was so
affected that he began to speak, but went out of the room to
recover himself.  And yesterday he saw the foreign ministers and
his horses, which I remember Dean Swift gives a great character
of; and was very sorry to leave them for the conversation of his
countrymen in England.; and I think he was much in the right.

Marlborough House, Nov. 15, 1737.
It is not many days since I wrote to your lordship by post, but
one can't be sure those letters are sent.  However, I have a mind
to give you an account of what, perhaps, you may not have so
particularly from any other hand.  This day, se'nnight the Queen
was taken extremely ill; the physicians were sent for, and from
the account that was given, they treated her as if she had the
gout in her stomach: but, upon a thorough investigation of the
matter, a surgeon desired that she would put her hand where the
pain was that she complained of, which she did; and the surgeon,
following her hand with his, found it was a very large rupture,
which had been long Concealed.  Upon this, immediately they cut
it, and some little part of the gut, which was discoloured.  Few
of the knowing people have had any hopes for many days; for they
still apprehend a mortification, and she can't escape it unless
the physicians can make something pass thro' her, which they have
not yet been able to do in so many days.  The King and the Royal
Family have taken leave of her more than once; and his Majesty
has given her leave to make her will, which she has done; but I
fancy it will be in such a manner that few, if any, will know
what her money amounts to.  Sir Robert Walpole was in Norfolk,
and came to -London but last night.  I can't but think he must be
extremely uneasy at this misfortune; for I have a notion that
many of his troops will slacken very much, if not quite leave
him, when they see he has lost his sure support.  But there is so
much folly, and mean corruption, etc.


London, December 1st, 1737.
. . . . As to what has passed in the Queen's illness, and since
her death, one can't depend on much one hears; and they are
things that it is no great matter whether they are true or false.
But one thing was odd: whether out of folly, or any thing else, I
can't say, but the Duke of Newcastle did not send Sir Robert
Walpole news of her illness, nor of her danger, as soon as he
might have done; and after he came to town, which was but a few
days before she died, and when she could no more live than she
can now come out of her coffin, the physicians, and all that
attended her, were ordered to say she was better, and that they
had some hopes.  What the use of that was I cannot conceive.  And
the occasion of her death is still pretended to be a secret: yet
it is known that she had a rupture, and had it for many years;
that she had imposthumes that broke, and that some of the guts
were mortified.  This is another mystery which I don't
comprehend; for what does it signify what one dies of, except the
pain it gives more than common dissolutions? etc.



[See p. 100. Reminiscences, Chapter Vii)

I AM Of the opinion, from woful experience, that, from flattery
and want of understanding, most princes are alike; and,
therefore, it is to no purpose to argue against their passions,
but to defend ourselves, at all events, against them.



[See P. 100. Reminiscences, Chapter VII]

Wimbledon, 17th Aug. 1737.
There has been a very extraordinary quarrel at court, which, I
believe, nobody will give you so exact an account of as myself.
The 31st of last month the Princess fell in labour.  The King and
Queen both knew that she was to lie in -,it St. James's, where
every thing was prepared.  It was her first child, and so little
a way to London, that she thought it less hazard to go
immediately away from Hampton Court to London, where she had all
the assistance that could be, and every thing prepared, than to
stay at Hampton Court, where she had nothing, and might be forced
to make use of a country midwife.  There was not a minute's time
to be lost in debating this matter, nor in ceremonials; the
Princess begging earnestly of the Prince to carry her to St.
James's, in such a hurry that gentlemen went behind the coach
like footmen.  They got to St. James's safe, and she was brought
to bed in one hour after.  Her Majesty followed them as soon as
she could, but did not come till it was all over.  However, she
expressed a great deal of anger to the Prince for having carried
her away, tho' she and the child were very well.  I should have
thought it had been most natural for a grandmother to have said
she had been mightily frightened, but was glad it was so well
over.  The Prince said all the respectful and dutiful things
imaginable to her and the King, desiring her Majesty to support
the reasons which made him go away as he did without acquainting
his Majesty with it: and, I believe, all human creatures will
allow that this was natural, for a man not to debate a thing of
this kind, nor to lose a minute's time in ceremony, which was
very useless, considering that it is a great while since the King
has spoke to him, or taken the least notice of him.  The Prince
told her Majesty he intended to go that morning to pay his duty
to the King, but she advised him not.  This was Monday morning,
and she said Wednesday was time enough; and, indeed, in that I
think her Majesty was in the right.  the Prince submitted to her
counsel, and only writ a most submissive and respectful letter to
his Majesty, giving his reasons for what he had done.  And this
conversation ended, that he hoped his Majesty would do him the
honour to be godfather to his daughter, and that he would be
pleased to name who the godmothers should be; and that he left
all the directions of the christening to his Majesty's pleasure.
The queen answered that it would be thought the asking the King
to be godfather was too great a liberty, and advised him not to
do it.  When the Prince led the Queen to her coach, which she
would not have had him done, there was a great concourse of
people; and, notwithstanding all that had passed before, she
expressed so much kindness that she hugged and kissed him with
great passion.  the King, after this, sent a message in writing,
by my Lord Essex, in the following words:-that his Majesty looked
upon what the Prince had done, in carrying the Princess to London
in such a manner, as a deliberate indignity offered to himself
and to the Queen, and resented it in the highest degree, and
forbid him the Court.  I must own I cleared Sir Robert in my own
mind of this counsel, thinking he was not in town: but it has
proved otherwise, for he was in town; and the message is drawn up
in such a manner that nobody doubts of its being done by sir
Robert.  All the sycophants and agents of the court spread
millions of falsities on this occasion; and all the language
there was, that this was so great a crime that even those who
went with the Prince ought to be proscribed.  How this will end
nobody yet knows; at least I am sure I don't; but I know there
was a council today held at Hampton court.  I have not heard yet
of any christening being directed, but for that I am in no manner
of pain: for, if it be never christened, I think 'tis in a better
state than a great many devout people that I know.  Some talk as
if they designed to take the child away from the Princess, to be
under the care of her Majesty, who professes vast kindness to the
Princess; and all the anger is at the Prince.  Among common
subjects I think the law is, that nobody that has any interest in
an estate is to have any thing to do with the person who is heir
to it.  What prejudice this sucking child can do to the crown I
don't see; but, to be sure, her Majesty will be very careful of
it.  What I apprehend most. is, that the crown will be lost long
before this little Princess can possibly enjoy it; and, if what I
have heard to-day be true, I think the scheme of France is going
to open; for I was told there was an ambassador to come from
France whose goods had been landed in England, and that they have
been sent back.  But I won't answer for the truth of that, as I
will upon every thing else in this letter.



[See p. 100. Reminiscences, Chapter VII]

June 20th, 1738.
My Lord,
I write to you this post, to give you an account of what I
believe nobody else will so particularly, that Madame Walmond
(130) was presented in the drawing-room to his Majesty on
Thursday.  As she arrived some days before, there can be no doubt
that it was not the first meeting, tho' the manner of her
reception had the appearance of it; for his Majesty went up to
her and kissed her on both sides, which is an honour, I believe,
never any lady had from a king in public.  And when his Majesty
went away, Lord Harrington presented the great men in the
ministry and the foreign ministers in the drawing-room; the
former of which performed their part with the utmost respect and
submission.  This is, likewise, quite new; for, though all kings
have had mistresses, they were attended at their own lodgings,
and not in so public a manner.  I conclude they performed that
ceremony too; but they could not lose the first opportunity of
paying their respects, though ever so improperly.

These great men were, the Duke of Newcastle, Sir Robert Walpole,
my Lord Wilmington, my Lord Harrington, and Mr. Pelham.  My Lord
Hervey had not the honour to be on the foot of a minister.   . .
.

I have nothing more to say, but that this Madame Walmond is at
present in a mighty mean dirty lodging in St. James's Street.
Her husband came with her, but he is going away; and that house
that was Mr. Seymour's, in Hyde Park, which opens into the King's
garden, is fitting up for her; -and the Duchess of Kendal's
lodgings are making ready for her at St. James's.  There is
nothing more known at present as to the settlement, but that
directions are given for one upon the establishment of Ireland.
perhaps that mayn't exceed the Duchess of Kendal's, which was
three thousand pounds a-year.  But 'tis easy for the first
minister to increase that as she pleases.



[See p. 101.]

London, December 3rd, 1737.
I saw one yesterday that dined with my Lord Fanny, (131) who, as
soon as he had dined, was sent for to come up to his Majesty, and
there is all the appearance that can be of great favour to his
lordship.  I mentioned him in my last, and I will now give you an
account of some things concerning his character, that I believe
you don't know.  What I am going to say I am sure is as true as
if I had been a transactor in it myself.  And I will begin the
relation with Mr. Lepelle, my Lord Fanny's wife's father, having
made her a cornet in his regiment as soon as she was born, which
is no more wrong to the design of an army than if she had been a
son: and she was paid many years after she was a maid of honour.
She was extreme forward and pert; and my Lord Sunderland got her
a pension of the late King, it being too ridiculous to continue
her any longer an officer in the army.  And into the bargain, she
was to be a spy; but what she could tell to deserve a pension, I
cannot comprehend.  However, King George the First used to talk
to her very much; and this encouraged my Lord Fanny and her to
undertake a very extraordinary project: and she went to the
drawing-room every night, and publicly attacked his Majesty in a
most vehement manner, insomuch that it was the diversion of all
the town; which alarmed the Duchess of Kendal, and the ministry
that governed her, to that degree, lest the King should be put in
the opposers' hands, that they determined to buy my Lady H- off;
and they gave her 4000 pounds to desist, which she did, and my
Lord Fanny bought a good house with it, and furnished it very
well.

[See p. 106. Reminiscences, Chapter IX]

London, March 19th, 1738.
My Lord,
I have received the favour of yours of the 11th by the post, but
not that which you mention by another hand.  And since you can
like such sort of accounts as I am able to give you, I will
continue to do it.  I think it is very plain now that Sir Robert
don't think it worth his while to make any proposals where it was
once suspected he would.  And his wedding was celebrated as if he
had been King of France, and the apartments furnished in the
richest manner: crowds of people of the first quality being
presented to the bride, who is the daughter of a clerk that sung
the psalms in a church where Dr. Sacheverell was.  After the
struggle among the court ladies who should have the honour of
presenting her, which the Duchess of Newcastle obtained, it was
thought more proper to have her presented by one of her own
family; otherwise it would look as if she had no alliances: and
therefore that ceremony was performed by Horace Walpole's wife,
who was daughter to my tailor, Lumbar.  I read in a print lately,
that an old gentleman, very rich, had married a maiden lady with
two fatherless children but the printer did not then know the
gentleman's name.



March 27th, 1738.
'I think I did not tell you that the Duke of Dorset waited on my
Lady Walpole to congratulate her marriage, with the same ceremony
as if it had been one of the Royal Family, with his white staff,
which has not been used these many years, but when they attend
the Crown.  But such a wretch as he is I hardly know; and his
wife, whose passion is only money, assists him in his odious
affair with Lady Betty Jermyn, who has a great deal to dispose
of; who, notwithstanding the great pride of the Berkeley family,
married an innkeeper's son.  But indeed there was some reason for
that; for she was ugly, without a portion, and in her youth had
an unlucky accident with one of her father's servants; and by
that match she got money to entertain herself all manner of ways.
I tell you these things, which did not happen in your time of
knowledge, which is a melancholy picture of what the world is
come to; for this strange woman has had a great influence over
many.


Feb. 24th. 1738.
Monday next is fixed for presenting Mrs. Skerrit at court: and
there has been great solicitation from the court ladies who
should do it, in which the Duchess of Newcastle has succeeded,
and all the apartment is made ready for Sir Robert's lady, at his
house at the Cockpit. (132)  I never saw her in my life, but at
auctions; but I remember I liked her as to behaviour very well,
and I believe she has a great deal of sense: and I am not one of
the number that wonder so much at this match; for the King of
France married Madame de Maintenon, and many men have done the
same thing.  But as to the public, I do believe never was any man
so great a villain as Sir Robert.


Wednesday, Feb. 16th, 1741.
.....Some changes are made as to employments; but very few are
brought in but such as will be easily governed, and brought to
act so as to keep their places.  I have inquired often about your
lordship, who I have not yet heard named in this alteration.  And
I have been told that Lords Chesterfield and Gower are to have
nothing in the government, which I think a very ill sign of what
is intended;  because that can be for no reason but because you
are all such men as are incapable of ever being prevailed on by
any arts to act any thing contrary to honour and the true
interests of our country.

                     Correspondence of Horace walpole
                              Earl of Orford




121 Letter 1
To Richard West, Esq. (133)
King's College, Nov 9, 1735,

Dear West,
You expect a long letter from me, and have said in verse all that
I intended to have said in far inferior prose.  I intended
filling three or four sides with exclamations against a
University life; but you have showed me how strongly they may be
expressed in three or four lines.  I can't build without straw;
nor have I the ingenuity of the spider, to spin fine lines out of
dirt: a master of a college would make but a miserable figure as
a hero of a poem, and Cambridge sophs are too low to introduce
into a letter that aims not at punning:

Haud equidem invideo vati, quem pulpita pascunt.

But why mayn't we hold a classical correspondence? I can
never forget the many agreeable hours we have passed in
reading Horace and Virgil; and I think they are topics
will never grow stale.  Let us extend the Roman empire,
and cultivate two barbarous towns o'er -run with rusticity and
Mathematics.  The creatures are so used to a circle,
that they Plod on in the same eternal round, with their
whole view confined to a punctum, cujus nulla est pars:
"Their time a moment, and a point their space."

Orabunt causas melius, coelique meatus
Describent radio, et surgentia sidera dicent
Tu coluisse novem Musas, Romane, memento;
Hae tibi crunt artes. . . .

We have not the least poetry stirring here; for I can't
call verses on the 5th of November and 30th of January
by that name, more than four lines on a chapter in the New
Testament is an epigram.  Tydeus (134) rose and set at Eton: he
is only known here to be a scholar of King's.  Orosmades  and
Almanzor are just the same; that is, I am almost the only person
they are acquainted with, and consequently the only person
acquainted with their excellencies.  Plato improves every day; so
does my friendship with him.  These three
divide my whole time, though I believe you will guess
there is no quadruple alliance; (135) that was a happiness which
I only enjoyed when you was at Eton.  A short account of the Eton
people at Oxford would much oblige, my dear West, your faithful
friend,
H. WALPOLE.


(133) Richard West was the only son of the Right Honourable
Richard West, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, by Elizabeth,
daughter of the celebrated Dr. Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury.  When
this correspondence commences, Mr. West was nineteen years old,
and Mr. Walpole one year younger.  [West died on the 1st of
January, 1742, at the premature age of twenty-six.  He had a
great genius for poetry.  His correspondence
with Gray, and several of his poems, are included
in the collection of letters published by Mr. Mason.
West's father published an able discourse of treasons and bills
of attainder, and a tract on the manner of creating peers.  He
also wrote several essays in "The Freethinker;" and was the
reputed author of a tragedy called "Hecuba;" which was performed
at Drury Lane theatre in 1726.]

(134) Tydeus, Orosmades, Almanzor, and Plato, were names
which had been given by them to some of their Eton
schoolfellows.

(135) Thus as boys they had called the intimacy formed at Eton
between Walpole, Gray, West, and Ashton.

122 Letter 2
To George Montagu, Esq. (136)
King's College, May 2, 1736.

Dear Sir,
Unless I were to be married myself, I should despair ever
being able to describe a wedding so well as you have done: had I
known your talent before, I would have desired an
epithalamium.  I believe the princess (137) will have more
beauties bestowed on her by the occasional poets, than even a
painter would afford her.  They will cook up a new Pandora, and
in the bottom of the box enclose Hope, that all they have said is
true.  A great many, out of excess of good breeding, having heard
it was rude to talk Latin before women, propose complimenting her
in English; which she will be much the
better for.  I doubt most of them instead of fearing their
compositions should not be understood, should fear they
should: they write they don't know what, to be read by they don't
know who.  You have made me a very unreasonable request, which I
will answer with another as extraordinary: you desire I would
burn your letters; I desire you would keep mine.  I know but of
one way of making what I send you useful, which is, by sending
you a blank sheet: sure you would not grudge three-pence for a
half-penny sheet, when you give as much for one not worth a
farthing.  You drew this last paragraph on you by your exordium,
as you call it, and conclusion.  I hope, for the future, our
correspondence will run a little more glibly, with dear George,
and dear Harry; not as formally as if we were playing a game at
chess in Spain and Portugal; and Don Horatio was to have the
honour Of specifying to Don Georgio, by an epistle, whether he
would move.  In one point I would have our correspondence like a
game at chess; it should last all our lives-but I hear you cry
check; adieu! Dear George, yours ever.

(136) George Montagu was the son of Brigadier-General Edward
Montagu, and nephew to the Earl of Halifax.  He was member of
parliament for Northampton, usher of the black rod in Ireland
during the lieutenancy of the Earl of Halifax, ranger of
Salsey Forest, and private secretary to Lord North when
chancellor of the exchequer.  [And of him "it is now only
remembered," says the "Quarterly Review," vol. xix. p. 131, "that
he was a gentleman-like body of the vieille cour, and that he was
usually attended by his brother John, (the Little John of
Walpole's correspondence,) who was a midshipman at the age of
sixty, and found his chief occupation in carrying about his
brother's snuff-box."]

123 Letter 3
To George Montagu, Esq.
King's College, May 6, 1736.

Dear George,
I agree with you entirely in the pleasure you take
in talking over old stories, but can't say but I meet
every day with new circumstances, which will be still
more pleasure to me to recollect.  I think at our age
'tis excess of joy, to think, while we are running over
past happinesses, that it is still in our power to enjoy
as great.  Narrations of the greatest actions of other people are
tedious in comparison of the serious trifles that every man can
call to mind of himself while he was learning
those histories.  Youthful passages of life are the chippings of
Pitt's diamond, set into little heart-rings with mottos; the
stone itself more worth, the filings more gentle
and agreeable.  Alexander, at the head of the world,
never tasted the true pleasure that boys of his own age
have enjoyed at the head of a school.  Little intrigues,
little schemes, and policies engage their thoughts;
and, at the same time that they are laying the foundation for
their middle age of life, the mimic republic they live in
furnishes materials of conversation for their latter age; and old
men cannot be said to be children a second time
with greater truth from any one cause, than their living
over again their childhood in imagination.  To reflect
on the season when first they felt the titillation of love, the
budding passions, and the first dear object of their
wishes! how unexperienced they gave credit to all the tales of
romantic loves! Dear George, were not the playing fields at Eton
food for all manner of flights?  No old maid's gown, though it
had been tormented into all the fashions from King James to King
George, ever underwent so many transformations as those poor
plains have in my idea.  At first I was contented with tending a
visionary flock, and sighing some pastoral name to the echo of
the cascade under the bridge.  How happy should I have been to
have had a kingdom only for the pleasure of being driven from it,
and living disguised in an humble vale! As I got further
into Virgil and Clelia, I found myself transported from Arcadia
to the garden of Italy; and saw Windsor Castle in no other view
than the Capitoli immobile saxum.  I wish a committee of the
House of Commons may ever seem to be the senate; or a bill appear
half so agreeable as a billet-doux.  You see how deep you have
carried me into old stories; I write of them with pleasure, but
shall talk of them with more to you.  I can't say I am sorry I
was never quite a schoolboy: an expedition against bargemen, or a
match at cricket, may be very pretty things to recollect; but,
thank my stars, I can remember things very near as pretty. The
beginning of my Roman history was spent in the asylum, or
conversing in Egeria's hallowed grove; not in thumping and
pommelling king Amulius's herdsmen.  I was sometimes troubled
with a rough creature or two from the plough; one, that one
should have thought, had worked with his head, as well as his
hands, they were both so callous.  One of the most agreeable
circumstances I can recollect is the Triumvirate, composed of
yourself, Charles,(138) and Your sincere friend.

124 Letter 4
To George Montagu, Esq.
King's College, May 20, 1736.

Dear George:
You will excuse my not having written to you, when you hear I
have been a jaunt to Oxford.  As you have seen it, I shall only
say I think it one of the most agreeable places I ever set my
eyes on.  In our way thither we stopped at the Duke of Kent's,
(139) at Wrest. (140)  On the great staircase is a picture of the
duchess; (141) I said it was very like; oh, dear sir! said Mrs.
Housekeeper, it's too handsome for my lady duchess; her grace's
chin is much longer than that.

In the garden are monuments in memory of Lord Harold (142) Lady
Glenorchy, (143) the late duchess,(144) and the present duke.  At
Lord Clarendon's (145) at Cornbury,(146) is a
prodigious quantity of Vandykes; but I had not time to take down
any of their dresses.  By the way, you gave me no account of the
last masquerade. Coming back, we saw Easton Neston,(147) a seat
of Lord Pomfret, where in an old greenhouse is a wonderful fine
statue of Tully, haranguing a numerous assembly of decayed
emperors, vestal virgins with new noses, Colossuses, Venuses,
headless carcases, and carcaseless heads, pieces of tombs, and
hieroglyphics.(148)  I saw Althorp(149) the same day, where are a
vast many pictures-some mighty good; a gallery with the Windsor
beauties, and Lady Bridgewater(150) who is full as handsome as
any of them; a bouncing head of, I believe, Cleopatra, called
there the Duchess of Mazarine.  The park is enchanting.  I forgot
to tell you I was at Blenheim, where I saw nothing but a cross
housekeeper, and an impertinent porter, except a few pictures, a
quarry of stone that looked at a distance like a great house, and
about this quarry, quantities of inscriptions in honour of the
Duke of Marlborough, and I think of her grace too.

Adieu! dear George, Yours ever.

(139) Henry de Grey, Duke, Marquis, and Earl of Kent, son of
Anthony Earl of Kent, and Mary, daughter of Lord Lucas. [The
duke, who had been so created in 1710, having lost all his sons
during his lifetime, obtained a new patent in 1740,
creating him Marquis Grey, with remainder to his
grand-daughter Jemima Campbell, daughter of his eldest
daughter, Lady amabel Grey, by her husband John, third Earl of
Breadalbane.  On the death of the duke, in June 1740, the
marquisate of Grey and barony of Lucas, together with the
Wrest House and all the vast estates of the duke, devolved upon
his grand-daughter, Lady Jemima Campbell, then Lady
Jemima Royston, she having married Philip Viscount Royston,
eldest son of the Earl of Hardwicke, by whom she had two
daughters, Amabel married in July 1772, to Lord Polwarth, only
son of the Earl of Marchmont, created a peer of Great Britain by
the title of Baron Hume of Berwick, and who died in 1781 without
issue: her ladyship was advanced to the dignity of Countess de
Grey by letters patent, in 1816, with remainder of that earldom
to her sister Mary Jemima, wife of Thomas second Lord Grantham,
and that lady's male issue.  Lady Grantham died in 1830; and upon
the death of the countess, in 1833, she was succeeded under the
patent by her nephew Lord Grantham, the present Earl de Grey.]

the death of the Duke of Kent, Wrest House has never
remained a second generation in the same family, but has
descended successively through females to the families of

vested in that of Robinson Lord Grantham, the
great-great-grandson of the duke.)

126 Letter 5
To George Montagu, Esq.
King's College, May 30, 1736.

Dear George,
You show me in the prettiest manner how much you like
Petronius Arbiter; I have heard you commend him, but I am more
pleased with your tacit approbation of writing like him, prose
interspersed with verse: I shall send you soon in return some
poetry interspersed with prose; I mean the Cambridge
congratulation with the notes, as you desired.  I have
transcribed the greatest part of what was tolerable at the
coffee-houses; but by most of what you will find, you will hardly
think I have left any thing worse behind.  There is lately come
out a new piece, called A Dialogue between
Philemon and Hydaspes on false religion, by one Mr.
Coventry,(151) A.M., and fellow, formerly fellow-commoner, of
Magdalen.  He is a young man, but 'tis really a pretty thing.  If
you cannot get it in town, I will send it with the verses.  He
accounts for superstition in a new manner, and I think a Just
One; attributing it to disappointments in love.  He don't
resolve it all into that bottom; ascribes it almost wholly as the
source of female enthusiasm; and I dare say there's ne'er a girl
from the age of fourteen to four-and-twenty, but will subscribe
to his principles, and own, if the dear man were dead that she
loves, she would settle all her affection on heaven, whither he
was gone.

Who would not be an Artemisia, and raise the stately mausoleum to
her lord; then weep and watch incessant over it like the Ephesian
matron!

I have heard of one lady, who had not quite so great a
veneration for her husband's tomb, but preferred lying alone in
one, to lying on his left hand; perhaps she had an aversion to
the German custom of left-handed wives.  I met yesterday with a
pretty little dialogue on the subject of constancy tis between a
traveller and a dove

LE PASSANT.
Que fais tu dans ce bois, plaintive Tourturelle?

LA ToURTURELLE.
Je g`emis, j'ai perdu ma compagne fidelle.

LE PASSANT.
Ne crains tu pas que l'oiseleur
Ne te fasse mourir comme elle?

La Tourturelle.
Si ce n'est lui, ce sera ma douleur.

'Twould have been a little more apposite, if she had grieved for
her lover.  I have ventured to turn it into that view,
lengthened it, and spoiled it, as you shall see.

P.-Plaintive turtle, cease your moan;
Hence away;
In this dreary wood alone
Why d'ye stay?



T.-These tears, alas! you see flow
For my mate!
P.-Dread you not from net or bow
His sad fate?

T.-If, ah! if they neither kill,
Sorrow will.

You will excuse this gentle nothing, I mean mine, when I tell
you, I translated it out of pure good-nature for the use of a
disconsolate wood-pigeon in our grove, that was made a widow by
the barbarity of a gun.  She coos and calls me so movingly,
'twould touch your heart to hear her. I protest to you it
grieves me to pity her.  She is so allicholy as any thing.  I'll
warrant you now she's as sorry as one of us would be.  Well, good
man, he's gone, and he died like a lamb.  She's an unfortunate
woman, but she must have patience; tis what we must all come to,
and so as I was saying, Dear George, good bye t'ye,
Yours sincerely.

P. S. I don't know yet when I shall leave Cambridge.

(151) Mr. Henry Coventry was the son of Henry Coventry, Esq. who
had a good estate in Cambridgeshire.  He was born in 1710, and
died in 1752.  He wrote four additional Dialogues.  The five were
republished shortly after his death, by his cousin, the Rev.
Francis Coventry.  The following is transcribed from the MSS. of
the Rev.  W. Cole:-

"When Henry Coventry first came to the University, he was of a
religious turn of mind, as was Mr. Horace Walpole; even so much
so as to go with Ashton, his then great friend, to pray with the
prisoners in the Castle.  Afterwards, both Mr.
Coventry and Mr. Walpole took to the infidel side of the
question."-E.



127 Letter 6
To Richard West, Esq.
King's College, Aug. 17, 1736.

Dear West,
Gray is at Burnham,(152) and, what is surprising, has not been at
Eton.  Could you live so near it without seeing it?
That dear scene of our quadruple-alliance would furnish me with
the most agreeable recollections.  'Tis the head
of our genealogical table, that is since sprouted out
into the two branches of Oxford and Cambridge.  You seem to be
the eldest son, by having got a whole inheritance to yourself;
while the manor of Granta is to be divided between your three
younger brothers, Thomas of Lancashire, [153] Thomas of
London [154] and Horace.  We don't wish you dead to enjoy your
seat, but your seat dead to enjoy you.  I hope you are a mere
elder brother, and live upon what your father left you, and in
the way you 'were brought up in, poetry: but we are supposed to
betake ourselves to some trade, as logic, philosophy, or
mathematics. If I should prove a mere younger brother, and not
turn to any Profession, would you receive me, and supply me out
of your stock, where you have such plenty? I have been so used to
the delicate food of Parnassus, that I can never condescend to
apply to the grosser studies of Alma Mater.  Sober cloth of
syllogism colour suits me ill; or, what's worse, I hate clothes
that one must prove to be of no colour at all.  If the Muses
coelique vias et sidera monstrent, and qua vi maria alta
lumescant.  why accipiant: but 'tis thrashing, to study
philosophy in the abstruse authors.  I am not against cultivating
these studies, as they are certainly useful; but then they quite
neglect all polite literature, all knowledge of this world.
Indeed, such people have not much occasion for this latter; for
they shut themselves up from it, and study till they know less
than any one.  Great mathematicians have been of great use;
but the generality of them are quite unconversible: they
frequent the stars, sub pedibusque vident nubes, but they can't
see through them.  I tell you what I see; that by living
amongst them, I write of nothing else: my letters are
all parallelograms, two sides equal to two sides; and every
paragraph an axiom, that tells you nothing but what every mortal
almost knows.  By the way, your letters come under this
description; for they contain nothing but what almost every
mortal knows too, that knows you-that is, they are
extremely agreeable, which they know you are capable of
making them:-no one is better acquainted with it than
Your sincere friend.

128 Letter 7
To George Montagu Esq.
King's College, March 20, 1737.

Dear George,
The first paragraph in my letter must be in answer to the last in
yours; though I should be glad to make you the return you ask, by
waiting on you myself.  'Tis not in my power, from more
circumstances than One, which are needless to tell you, to
accompany you and Lord Conway(155) to Italy: you add to the
pleasure it would give me, by asking it so kindly.  You I am
infinitely obliged to, as I was capable, my dear George, of
making you forget for a minute that you don't propose stirring
from the dear place you are now in.  Poppies indeed are the chief
flowers in love nosegays, but they seldom bend towards the lady;
at least not till the other flowers have been
gathered.  Prince Volscius's boots were made of love-leather, and
honour-leather; instead of honour, some people's are made of
friendship; but since you have been so good to me as to draw on
this, I can almost believe you are equipped for
travelling farther than Rheims.  'Tis no little inducement to
make me wish myself in France, that I hear gallantry is not left
off there; that you may be polite and not be thought
awkward for it.  You know the pretty men of the age in England
use the women with no more deference than they do their coach-
horses, and have not half the regard for them that they have for
themselves.  The little freedoms you tell me you use take off
from formality, by avoiding which ridiculous extreme we are
dwindled into the other barbarous one, rusticity.  If you had
been at Paris, I should have inquired about the new
Spanish ambassadress, who, by the accounts we have thence, at her
first audience of the queen, sat down with her at a
distance that suited respect and conversation.  Adieu, dear
George,
Yours most heartily.

Walpole died in the August of the year in which the present
letter was written, and Sir Robert soon afterwards married @Miss
Skerrit.  Walpole's well-known fondness for his mother is alluded
to by Gray, in a letter to West, dated 22d August, 1737:-" But

my poor Horace must feel on that account

129 Letter 8
To George Montagu, Esq.
Christopher Inn, Eton.

The Christopher.  Lord! how great I used to think anybody just
landed at the Christopher! But here are no boys for me to send
for-here I am, like Noah, just returned into
his old world again, with all sorts of queer feels about me.  By
the way, the clock strikes the old cracked sound-I recollect so
much, and remember so little-and want to play about-and am so
afraid of my playfellows-and am ready to shirk Ashton and can't
help making fun of myself-and envy a dame over the way, that has
just locked in her boarders, and is going to sit down in a little
hot parlour to a very bad supper, so comfortably!  and I could be
so jolly a dog if I did not fat, which, by the way, is the first
time the word was ever applicable to me.  In short, I should be
out of all bounds if I was to tell you half I feel, how young
again I am
one minute, and how old the next.  But do come and feel
with me, when you will-to-morrow-adieu! If I don't compose myself
a little more before Sunday morning, when Ashton
is to preach, I shall certainly be in a bill for
laughing at church; but how to belt it, to see him
in the pulpit, when the last time I saw him here, was standing up
funking at a conduit to be catechised.  Good night; yours.

130 Letter 9
                       To Richard West, Esq.
Paris, April 21, N. S. 1739. (157)

Dear West,
You figure us in a set of pleasures, which, believe me, we do not
find; cards and eating are so universal, that they absorb all
variation of pleasures.  The operas, indeed, are much frequented
three times a week; but to me they would be a greater penance
than eating maigre: their music resembles a gooseberry tart as
much as it does harmony.  We have not yet been at the Italian
playhouse; scarce any one goes there.  Their best amusement, and
which in some parts, beats ours, is the comedy three or four of
the actors excel any we have: but then to this nobody goes, if it
is not one of the fashionable nights; and then they go, be the
play good or bad-except on
Moli`ere's nights, whose pieces they are quite weary of.  Gray
and I have been at the Avare to-night; I cannot at all commend
their performance of it.  Last night I was in the Place de Louis
le Grand (a regular octagon, uniform, and the houses handsome,
though not so large as Golden Square), to see what they reckoned
one of the finest burials that ever was in France.  It was the
Duke de Tresmes, governor of Paris and marshal of France.  It
began on foot from his palace to his parish-church, and from
thence in coaches to the opposite end of Paris, to b interred in
the church of the Celestins, where is his family-vault.  About a
week ago we happened to see the grave digging, as we went to see
the church, which is old and small., but fuller of fine ancient
monuments than any, except St. Denis, which we saw
on the road, and excels Westminster; for the windows are all '
painted in mosaic, and the tombs as fresh and well preserved as
if they were of yesterday.  In the Celestins' church
is a votive column to Francis II., which says, that it is one
assurance of his being immortalised, to have had the martyr Mary
Stuart for his wife.  After this long digression, I return to the
burial, which was a most vile thing. A long procession of
flambeaux and friars; no plumes, trophies, banners,
led horses, scutcheons, or open chariots; nothing but friars,
white, black, and grey, with all their trumpery.  This goodly
ceremony began at nine at night, and did not finish till three
this morning; for, each church they passed, they stopped
for a hymn and holy water.  By the bye, some of these choice
monks, who watched the body while it lay in state, fell asleep
one night, and let the tapers catch fire of the rich velvet
mantle lined with ermine and powdered with gold
flower-de-luces, which melted the lead coffin, and burnt off the
feet of the deceased before it awakened them.  The French love
show; but there is a meanness runs through it all.  At the house
where I stood to see this procession, the room was hung with
crimson damask and gold, and the windows were mended in ten or a
dozen places with paper.  At dinner they give you three courses;
but a third of the dishes is patched up with sallads, butter,
puff-paste, or some such miscarriage of a dish.  None, but
Germans, wear fine clothes; but their coaches are tawdry enough
for the wedding of Cupid and Psyche. You would-laugh extremely at
their signs: some live at
the Y grec, some at Venus's toilette, and some at the sucking
cat.  YOU would not easily guess their notions of honour: I'll
tell you one: it is very dishonourable for any gentleman not to
be 'in @he army, or in the king's service as they
call it, and it is no dishonour to keep public gaming-houses:
there are at least an hundred and fifty people of the first
quality in Paris who live by it.  You may go into their houses at
all hours of the night, And find hazard, pharaoh, etc.  The men
who keep the hazard tables at the duke de Gesvres' pay him twelve
guineas each night for the privilege.  Even the princesses of the
blood are dirty enough to have shares in the banks kept at their
houses. We have seen two or three of them; but they are not
young, nor remarkable but for wearing their red of a deeper dye
than other women, though all use it extravagantly.

The weather is still so bad, that we have not made any
excursions to see Versailles and the environs, not even walked in
the Tuileries; but we have seen almost every thing else that is
worth seeing in Paris, though that is very
considerable.  They beat us vastly in buildings, both in number
and magnificence.  The tombs of Richelieu and Mazarin at the
Sorbonne and the College de Quatre Nations are wonderfully fine,
especially the former. We have seen very little of the people
themselves, who are not inclined to be propitious to strangers,
especially if they do not play and speak the language readily.
There are many English here: Lord Holderness, Conway(158) and
Clinton, (159) and Lord George Bentinck; (160) Mr. Brand,(161)
Offley, Frederic, Frampton, Bonfoy, etc.  Sir John
Cotton's son and a Mr. Vernon of Cambridge passed through Paris
last week.  We shall stay here about a fortnight longer,
and then go to Rheims with Mr. Conway for two or three months.
When you have nothing else to do, we shall be glad to hear from
you; and any news.  If we did not remember there was such a place
as England, we should know nothing of it: the French never
mention it, unless it happens to be in one of their proverbs!
Adieu!  Yours ever.

To-morrow we go to the Cid.  They have no farces but  petites
pieces like our "Devil to Pay."

132 Letter 10
To Richard West, Esq.
>From Paris, 1739.

Dear West,
I should think myself to blame not to try to divert you, when you
tell me I can.  From the air of your letter you seem to want
amusement, that is, you want spirits.  I
would recommend to you certain little employments that I know of,
and that belong to you, but that I imagine bodily exercise is
more suitable to your complaint.  If you would promise me to read
them in the Temple garden, I would send you a little packet of
plays and pamphlets that we have made up, and intend to dispatch
to 'Dick's' the first opportunity.-Stand by, clear the way, make
room for the pompous appearance of Versailles le Grand!--But no:
it fell so short of my idea of it, mine, that I have resigned to
Gray the office of writing its panegyric.(162)  He likes it.
They say I am to like it better next Sunday; when the sun is to
shine., the king is to be fine, the water-works are to play, and
the new knights of the Holy Ghost are to be
installed!  Ever since Wednesday, the day we were there, we have
done nothing but dispute about it.  They say, we did not see it
to advantage, that we ran through the apartments, saw the garden
en passant, and slubbered over Trianon.  I say, we saw nothing.
However, we had time to see that the great front is a lumber of
littleness, composed of black brick, stuck full of bad old busts,
and fringed with gold rails.  The rooms
are all small, except the great gallery, which is noble,
but totally wainscoted with looking-glass.  The garden is
littered with statues and fountains, each of which has its
tutelary deity.  In particular, the elementary god of fire
solaces himself in one.  In another, Enceladus, in lieu of a
mountain, is overwhelmed with many waters.  There are avenues of
water-pots, who disport themselves much in squirting up
cascadelins.  In short, 'tis a garden for a great child.  Such
was Louis Quatorze, who is here seen in his proper colours, where he commanded in person, unassisted by his armies
and his generals, left to the pursuit of his own puerile ideas of
glory.

We saw last week a place of another kind, and which has more the
air of what it would be, than anything I have yet met with: it
was the convent of the Chartreux.  All the conveniences, or
rather (if there was such a word) all the adaptments are
assembled here, that melancholy, meditation, selfish devotion,
and despair would require.  But yet 'tis pleasing.  Soften the
terms, and mellow the uncouth horror that reigns here, but a
little, and 'tis a charming solitude.  It stands on a large space
of ground, is old and irregular.  The chapel is gloomy: behind
it, through some dark passages, you pass into a large obscure
hall, which looks like a combination-chamber for some hellish
council.  The large cloister surrounds their buryingground.  The
cloisters are very narrow and very long, and let into the cells,
which are built like little huts detached from each other.  We
were carried into one, where lived a middle-aged man not long
initiated into the order.  He was extremely civil, and called
himself Dom Victor.  We have promised to visit him often.  Their
habit is all white: but besides this he was infinitely clean in
his person; and his apartment and garden, which he keeps and
cultivates without any assistance, was neat to a degree.  He has
four little rooms, furnished in the prettiest manner, and hung
with good prints.  One of them is a library, and another a
gallery.  He has several canary-birds disposed in a pretty manner
in breeding-cages. in his garden was a bed of good tulips in
bloom, flowers and
fruit-trees, and all neatly kept.  They are permitted at certain
hours to talk to strangers, but never to one another, or to go
out of their convent.  But what we chiefly went to see was the
small  cloister, with the history of St. Bruno their founder,
painted by Le Sceur.  It consists of twenty-two pictures, the
figures a good deal less than life.  But sure they are amazing! I
don't know what Raphael may be in Rome, but these pictures excel
all I have seen in Paris and England.  The figure of the dead man
who spoke at his burial, contains all the strongest and horridest
ideas of ghastliness, hypocrisy discovered, and the height of
damnation, pain and cursing.  A Benedictine monk, who was there
at the same time, said to me of this picture C'est une fable,
mais on la croyoit autrefois.  Another, who
showed me relics in one of their churches, expressed as much
ridicule for them.  The pictures I have been speaking of
are ill preserved, and some of the finest heads defaced,
which was done at first by a rival of Le Soeur's.  Adieu! dear
West, take care of your health; and some time or other we will
talk over all these things with more pleasure than I have had in
seeing them.

Yours ever.

134 Letter 11
To Richard West, Esq.
Rheims, (163) June 18, 1739, N. S.

Dear West,
How I am to fill up this letter is not easy to divine.  I have
consented that Gray shall give an account of our situation and
proceedings; (164) and have left myself at the mercy of my own'
invention--a most terrible resource, and which I shall avoid
applying to if I can possibly help it.  I had prepared the
ingredients for a description of a ball, and was just ready to
serve it up to you, but he has plucked it from me.  However, I
was resolved to give you an account of a particular song and
dance in it, and was determined to write the words and Sing the
tune just as I folded up my letter: but as it would, ten to one,
be opened before it gets to you, I am forced to lay aside this
thought, though an admirable one.  Well, but now I have put it
into your head, I suppose you won't rest without it.  For that
individual one, believe me 'tis nothing without the tune and the
dance; but to stay your
stomach, I -will send you one of their vaudevilles or Ballads,
(165) which they sing at the comedy after their
petites pi`eces.

You must not wonder if all my letters resemble dictionaries, with
French on one side and English on t'other; I deal in nothing else
at present, and talk a couple of words of each language
alternately, from morning till night.  This has put my mouth a
little out of tune at present but I am trying to recover the use
of it by reading the newspapers aloud at breakfast, and by
shewing the title-pages of all my English books.  Besides this, I
have paraphrased half of the first act of your new GustavUS (166)
which was sent us to Paris: a most dainty performance, and just
what you say of it.  Good night, I am sure you must be tired: if
you are not, I am.  yours ever.

(163) Mr. Walpole, with his cousin Henry Seymour Conway and Mr.
Gray, resided three months at Rheims, principally to
acquire the French language.

(164) Gray's letter to West has not been preserved; but one
addressed to his mother, on the 21 st of June, containing an
account of Rheims and the society, is printed in his Works, vol.
ii. p. 50.-E.

(165) This ballad does not appear.

(166) The tragedy of "Gustavus Vasa," by Henry Brooke, author of
"The Fool of Quality."  It was rehearsed at Drury Lane; but, as
it was supposed to satirize Sir Robert Walpole, it was prohibited
to be acted.  This, however, did Brooke no injury, as he was
encouraged to publish the play by subscription.-E.



134 Letter 12
To Richard  West, Esq.
Rheims, July 20, 1739.

Gray says, Indeed you ought to write to West.-Lord, child, so I
would, if I knew what to write about.  If I were in London and he
at Rheims, I would send him volumes about peace and war,
Spaniards, camps, and conventions; but d'ye think he
cares sixpence to know who is gone to Compiegne, and when they
come back, or who won and lost four livres at quadrille last
night at Mr. Cockbert's?--No, but you may tell him what you have
heard of Compiegne; that they have balls twice a week after the
play, and that the Count d'Eu gave the king a most flaring
entertainment in the camp, where the Polygone was
represented in flowering shrubs.  Dear West, these are the things
I must tell you; I don't know how to make 'em look
significant, unless you will be a Rhemois for a little
moment.(167)  I wonder you can stay out of the city so long, when
we are going to have all manner of diversions.  The comedians
return hither from Compiegne in eight days, for example; and in a
very little of time one attends the regiment of the king, three
battalions and an hundred of officers; all men of a
certain fashion, very amiable, and who know their world.  Our
women grow more gay, more lively, from day to day, in
expecting them; Mademoiselle la Reine is brewing a wash of a
finer dye, and brushing up her eyes for their arrival.  La Barone
already counts upon fifteen of them: and Madame Lelu, finding her
linen robe conceals too many beauties, has bespoke one of gauze.

I won't plague you any longer with people you don't know, I mean
French ones; for you must absolutely hear of an
Englishman that lately appeared at Rheims.  About two days ago,
about four o'clock in the afternoon, and about an hour after
dinner,-from all which you may conclude we dine at two
o'clock,-as we were picking our teeth round a littered table and
in a crumby room, Gray in an undress, Mr. Conway in a
morning gray coat, and I in a trim white night-gown and
slippers, very much out of order, with a very little cold, a
message discomposed us all of a sudden, with a service to Mr.
Walpole from Mr. More, and that, if he pleased, he would wait on
him.  We scuttled upstairs in great confusion, but with no other
damage than the flinging down two or three glasses and the
dropping a slipper by the way.  Having ordered the room to be
cleaned out, and sent a very civil response to Mr. More, we began
to consider who Mr. More should be.  Is it Mr. More of Paris!
No.  Oh, 'tis Mr. More, my Lady Teynham's husband?  No, it can't
be he.  A Mr. More, then, that lives in the
Halifax family?  No. In short, after thinking of ten thousand
more Mr. Mores, we concluded it could never be a one of 'em.  By
this time Mr.  More arrives; but such a Mr. More!  a young
gentleman out of the wilds of Ireland, who has never been in
England, but has got all the ordinary language of that
kingdom; has been two years at Paris, where he dined at an
ordinary with the refugee Irish, and learnt fortification-,,
which he does not understand at all, and which yet is the only
thing he knows.  In short, he is a young swain of very uncouth
phrase, inarticulate speech, and no ideas. This hopeful child is
riding post into Lorrain, or any where else, he is not
certain; for if there is a war he shall go home again: for we
must give the Spaniards another drubbing, you know; and if the
Dutch do but join us, we shall blow up all the ports in
Europe; for our ships are our bastions, and our ravelines, and
our hornworks; and there's a devilish wide ditch for 'em to pass,
which they can't fill up with things-Here Mr. Conway helped him
to fascines.  By this time I imagine you have
laughed at him as much, and were as tired of him as we were; but
he's gone.  This is the day that Gray and I intended for the
first of a southern circuit; but as Mr. Selwyn and George Montagu
design us a visit here, we have put off our journey for some
weeks.  When we get a little farther, I hope our
memories will brighten: at present they are but dull, dull as
Your humble servant ever.

P. S. I thank you ten thousand times for your last letter: when I
have as much wit and as much poetry in me, I'll send you as good
an one.  Good night, child!

136 Letter 13
To Richard West, Esq.
>From a Hamlet among the Mountains of Savoy,
Sept. 28, 1739, N. S.

Precipices, mountains, torrents, wolves, rumblings, Salvator
Rosa-the pomp of our park and the meekness of our palace!  Here
we are, the lonely lords of glorious, desolate prospects.  I have
kept a sort of resolution which I made, of not writing to you as
long as I staid in France: I am now a quarter of an hour out of
it, and write to you.  Mind, 'tis three months since we heard
from you.  I begin this letter -among the clouds; where I shall
finish, my neighbour Heaven probably knows: 'tis an odd wish in a
mortal letter, to hope not to finish it on this side the
atmosphere.  You will have a billet tumble to you from the stars
hen you least think of it; and that I should write it too!  Lord,
how potent that sounds! But I am to undergo many
transmigrations before I come to "yours ever." Yesterday I was a
shepherd of Dauphin`e; to-day an Alpine savage; to-morrow a
Carthusian monk; and Friday a Swiss Calvinist.  I have one
quality which I find remains with me in all worlds and in all
aethers; I brought it with me from your world, and am admired for
it in this-'tis my esteem for you: this is a common thought among
you, and you will laugh at it, but it is new here: as new to
remember one's friends in the world one has left, as for you to
remember those you have lost.

Aix in Savoy, Sept. 30th.

We are this minute come in here, and here's an awkward abb`e this
minute come in to us.  I asked him if he would sit down.  Oui,
oui, oui.  He has ordered us a radish soup for supper, and has
brought a chess-board to play with Mr. Conway.  I have left 'em
in the act, and am set down to write to you.  Did you ever see
any thing like the prospect we saw yesterday? I never did.  We
rode three leagues to see the Grande Chartreuse; (168)
expected bad roads and the finest convent in the kingdom.  We
were disappointed pro and con.  The building is large and plain,
and has nothing remarkable but its primitive simplicity; they
entertained us in the neatest manner, with eggs, pickled salmon,
dried fish, conserves, cheese, butter, grapes, and figs, and
pressed us mightily to lie there.  We tumbled into the hands of a
lay-brother, who, unluckily having the charge of the meal and
bran, showed us little besides.  They desired us to set down our
names in the list of strangers, where, among others, we found two
mottos of our countrymen, for whose stupidity and brutality we
blushed.  The first was of Sir j * * * D * * *, who had wrote
down the first stanza of justum et tenacem, altering the last
line to Mente quatit Carthusiana.  The second was of one D * *,
Coelum ipsum petimus stultitia; et hic ventri indico bellum.  The
Goth!-But the road, West, the road!  winding round a prodigious
mountain, and surrounded with others, all shagged with hanging
woods, obscured with pines, or lost in clouds!  Below, a torrent
breaking through cliffs, and tumbling through fragments of rocks!
Sheets of @cascades forcing their silver speed down channelled
precipices, and hasting into the roughened river at the bottom!
Now and then an old foot-bridge, with a broken rail, a leaning
cross, a cottage, or the ruin of an hermitage!  This sounds too
bombast and too romantic to one that has not seen it, too cold
for one that has.  If I could send you my letter post between two
lovely tempests that echoed each other's wrath you might have
some idea of this noble roaring scene, as you were reading it.
Almost on the summit, upon a fine verdure, but without any
prospect, stands the Chartreuse.  We staid there two hours, rode
back through this charming picture, wished for a painter, wished
to be poets! Need I tell you we wished for you? Good night!

Geneva, Oct. 2.

By beginning a new date, I should begin a new letter; but I have
seen nothing yet, and the Post is going Out: 'tis a strange
tumbled dab, and dirty too, I am sending you; but what can I do?
There is no possibility of writing such a long history over
again.  I find there are many English in the town; Lord Brook,
(169) Lord Mansel, (170) Lord Hervey's eldest son,(171) and a son
of-of Mars and Venus, or of Antony and Cleopatra, or, in short,
of-.  This is the boy, in the bow of whose hat Mr. Hedges pinned
a pretty epigram.  I don't know if you ever heard it; I'll
suppose you never did, because it will fill up my letter:

"Give but Cupid's dart to me,
Another Cupid I shall be:
No more distinguish'd from the other,
Than Venus would be from my mother."

Scandal says, Hedges thought the two last very like; and it says
too, that she was not his enemy for thinking so.

Adieu! Gray and I return to Lyons in three days.  Harry stays
here.  Perhaps at our return we may find a letter from you: it
ought to be very full of excuses, for you have been a lazy
creature: I hope you have, for I would not owe your silence to
any other reason.
Yours ever.

(168) It was on revisiting it, when returning to England after
his unfortunate quarrel with Walpole, that Gray inscribed his
beautiful "Alcaic Ode" in the album of the fathers of this
monastery.  Gray's account of this grand scene, where "not a
precipice, not a torrent, not a cliff, but is pregnant with
religion and poetry," will be found in his letter to West, dated
Turin, Nov. 16, N. S. 1739. Works, vol. ii. p. 69.-E.

(169) Francis Lord Brooke, advanced to the dignity of Earl Brooke
in 1746.-E.

was succeeded in the title by his uncles Christopher and Bussy;

138 Letter 14
To Richard West, Esq.
Turin, Nov. 11, 1739, N. S.

So, as the song says, we are in fair Italy! I wonder we are; for
on the very highest precipice of Mount Cenis, the devil of
discord, in the similitude of sour wine, had got amongst our
Alpine savages, and set them a-fighting with Gray and me in the
chairs: they rushed him by me on a crag, where there was scarce
room for a cloven foot.  The least slip had tumbled us into such
a fog, and such an eternity, as we should never have found our
way out of again.  We were eight days in coming hither from
Lyons; the four last in crossing the Alps.  Such uncouth rocks,
and such uncomely inhabitants!  My dear West, I hope I shall
never see them again!  At the foot of Mount Cenis we were obliged
to quit our chaise, which was taken all to pieces and loaded on
mules; and we were carried in low arm-chairs on poles, swathed in
beaver bonnets, beaver gloves, beaver stockings, muffs, and
bear-skins.  When we came to the top, behold the snows fallen!
and such quantities, and conducted by such heavy clouds that hung
glouting, that I thought we could never have waded through them.
The descent is two leagues, but steep and rough as O * * * *
father's face, over which,
you know, the devil walked with hobnails in his shoes.  But the
dexterity and nimbleness of the mountaineers are
inconceivable: they run with you down steeps and frozen
precipices, where no man, as men are now, could possibly walk.
We had twelve men and nine mules to carry us, our servants, and
baggage, and were above five hours in this agreeable jaunt The
day before, I had a cruel accident, and so extraordinary an one,
that it seems to touch upon the traveller.  I had brought with me
a little black spaniel of King Charles's breed; but the
prettiest, fattest, dearest creature!  I had let it out of the
chaise for the air, and it was waddling along close to the head
of the horses, on the top of the highest Alps, by the side of a
wood of firs. There darted out a young wolf, seized poor dear
Tory (172) by the throat, and, before we could possibly prevent
it, sprung up the side of the rock and carried him off.  The
postilion jumped off and struck at him with his whip, but in
vain.  I saw it and screamed, but in vain; for the road was so
narrow, that the servants that were behind could not get by the
chaise to shoot him.  What is the extraordinary part is, that it
was but two o'clock, and broad sunshine.  It was shocking to see
anything one loved run away with to so
horrid a death.  .... .

Just coming out of Camber, which is a little nasty old hole, I
copied an inscription set up at the end of a great road, which
was practised through an immense solid rock by bursting it
asunder with gunpowder.  The Latin is pretty enough, and so I
send it
you:

"Carolus Emanuel II.  Sab. dux, Pedem. princeps, Cypri
rex,public`a felicitate part`a, singulorum commodis intentus,
breviorem securioremque viam regiam, natur`a occlusam, Romanis
intentatam, mteris desperatam, dejectis scopulorum repagulus,
aquata montiuminiquitate, quae cervicibus imminebant precipitia
pedibus substernens, aeternis populorum commerciis patefecit.
 A.D. 1670."

We passed the Pas de Suze, where is a strong fortress on a rock,
between two very neighbouring mountains; and then, through a fine
avenue of three leagues, we at last discovered Tturin:--

"E l'un k l'altro mostra, ed in tanto oblia
La noia, e'l mal 'delta passata via."'

'Tis really by far one of the prettiest cities I have seen; not
one of your large straggling ones that can afford to have twenty
dirty suburbs, but, clean and compact, very new and very regular.
The king's palace is not of the proudest without, but of the
richest within; painted, gilt, looking-glassed, very costly, but
very tawdry; in short, a very popular palace.  We were last night
at the Italian comedy-the devil of a house and the devil of
actors! Besides this, there is a sort of an heroic tragedy,
called "La rapprentatione dell' Anima Damnata."(173)  A woman, a
sinner, comes in and makes a solemn prayer to the Trinity: enter
Jesus Christ and the Virgin: he scolds, and exit: she tells the
woman her son is very angry, but she don't know, she will see
what she can do.  After the play we were introduced to the
assembly, which they call the conversazione: there were many
people playing at ombre, pharaoh, and a game called taroc, with
cards so high, (174) to the number of seventy-eight.  There are
three or four English here Lord Lincoln,(175) with Spence,(176)
your professor of poetry; a Mr. B*** and a Mr. C*** a man that
never utters a syllable.  We have tried all stratagems to make
him speak.  Yesterday he did at last open his mouth, and said
Bec.  all laughed so at the novelty of the thing that he shut it
again, and will never speak more.  I think you can't complain now
of my not writing to you.  What a volume of trifles!  I wrote
just the fellow to it from Geneva; had it you?  Farewell! Thine.

(172) This incident is described also by Gray in one of his
letters to his mother. "If the dog," he adds, "had not been
there, and the creature had thought fit to lay hold of one of the
horses, chaise and we, and all, must inevitably have tumbled
above fifty fathoms perpendicularly down the precipice."-E.

(173) This representation is also mentioned by Spence, in a
letter to his mother:-"In spite of the excellence," he says, "of
the actors, the greatest part of the entertainment to me was the
countenances of the people in the pit and boxes.  When the devils
were like to carry off the Damned Soul, every body was in the
utmost consternation and when St. John spoke so obligingly to
her, they were ready to cry out for joy.  When the Virgin
appeared on the stage, every body looked respectful; and, on
several words spoke by the actors, they pulled off, their hats,
and crossed themselves.  What can you think of a people, where
their very farces are religious, and where they are so
religiously received?  It was from such a play as this (called
Adam and Eve) that Milton when he was in Italy, is said to have
taken the first hint for his divine poem of "Paradise Lost."
What small beginnings are there sometimes to the greatest
things!-E.

(174) In the manuscript the writing of this word is extraordinary
tall.

(175) Henry ninth Earl of Lincoln, who having, in 1744, married
Catherine, eldest daughter and heiress of the Right Honourable
Henry Pelham, inherited, in 1768, the dukedom of
Newcastle-under-Line at the demise of the countess's uncle,
Thomas Pelham Holles, who, in 1756, had been created Duke of
Newcastle-under-Line, with special remainder to the Earl of
Lincoln.-E.

(176) The Rev.  Joseph Spence, the author of one of the best
collections of ana the English language possesses-the well-known
"Anecdotes, Observations, and Characters of Books and Men," of
which the best edition is that edited by Singer.-E.




140 Letter 15
To Richard West, Esq.
>From Bologna, 1739.

I don't know why I told Ashton I would send you an account of
what I saw: don't believe it, I don't intend it.  Only think what
a vile employment 'tis, making
catalogues!  And then one should have that odious Curl (177) get
at one's letters, and publish them like Whitfield's
Journal, or for a supplement to the Traveller's Pocket
Companion.  Dear West, I protest against having seen any thing
but what all the world has seen; nay, I have not seen half that,
not-some of the most common things; not so much as a miracle.
Well, but you don't expect it, do you?  Except
pictures.  and statues, we are not very fond of sights; don't go
a-staring after crooked towers and conundrum staircases.  Don't
you hate, too, a jingling epitaph (178) of one Procul and one
Proculus that is here?  Now and then we drop in at a procession,
or a high-mass, hear the music, enjoy a strange attire, and hate
the foul monkhood.  Last week, was the feast of the Immaculate
Conception.  On the eve we went to the
Franciscans' church to hear the academical exercises.  There were
moult and moult clergy, about two dozen dames, that
treated one another with illustrissima and brown kisses, the
vice-legate, the gonfalonier, and some senate.  The
vice-legate, whose conception was not quite so immaculate, is a
young personable person, of about twenty, and had on a
mighty pretty cardinal-kind of habit; 'twould make a
delightful masquerade dress.  We asked his name: Spinola.  What,
a nephew of the cardinal-legate?  Signor, no: ma credo che gli
sia qualche cosa.  He sat on the right hand with the gonfalonier
in two purple fauteuils.  Opposite was a throne of crimson
damask, with the device of the Academy, the Gelati; and trimmings
of gold.  Here sat at a table, in black, the head of' the
academy, between the orator and the first poet At two
semicircular tables on either hand sat three poets and three;
silent among many candles.  The chief made a little introduction,
the orator a long Italian vile harangue.  Then the chief, the
poet, and the poets,-who were a Franciscan, an Olivetan, an old
abb`e, and three lay,-read their
compositions; and to-day they are pasted up in all parts of the
town.  As we came out of the church, we found all the
convent and neighbouring houses lighted all over with
lanthorns of red and yellow paper, and two bonfires.  But you are
sick of this foolish ceremony; I'll carry you to no more -. I
will only mention, that we found the Dominicans' church here in
mourning for the inquisitor: 'twas all hung with black cloth,
furbelowed and festooned with yellow gauze.  We have seen a
furniture here in a much prettier taste; a gallery of Count
Caprara's: in the panels between the windows are pendent trophies
of various arms taken by one of his ancestors from the Turks.
They are whimsical, romantic, and have a pretty effect.  I looked
about, but could not perceive the portrait of the lady at whose
feet they were indisputably offered. In coming out of Genoa we
were more lucky; found the very spot where Horatio and Lothario
were to have fought, "west of the town, a mile among the rocks."

My dear West, in return for your epigrams of Prior, I will
transcribe some old verses too, but which I fancy I can show you
in a sort of a new light.  They are no newer than Virgil, and
what is more odd, are in the second Georgic.  'Tis, that I have
observed that he not only excels when he is like himself, but
even when he is very like inferior poets: you will say that they
rather excel by being like him: but mind, they are all near one
another:

"Si non ingenter oribus domus alta superbis
Mane sa@atame totis vomit Eedibus uridam:"

And the four next lines; are they not just like Martial? In the
following he is as much Claudian"

"Illum non populi fasces, non purpura regum
Flexit, et infidos agitans discordia fratres;
Aut conjurato descendens Dacus ab Istro."

Then who are these like?

"nec ferrea jura, insanumque forum,
aut populi tabularia vidit.
Sollicitant alii remis freta ceca, ruuntque
In ferrum, penetrant aulas et limina regum.
Hic petit excidiis urbem miseresque Penates,
Ut gemma, bibat, et Sarrano indormiat ostro."

Don't they seem to be Juvenal's?-There are some more, which to me
resemble, Horace; but perhaps I think so from his having some on
a parallel subject.  Tell me if I am mistaken; these are they:

"Interea dulces pendent eircum oscula nati:
Casta pudicitiam servat domus-"

inclusively to the end of these:


"Hanc olim veteres vitam colti`ere Sabini
Hanc Remus et frater: sic fortis Etruria crevit,
Scilicet et retum facta est pulcherrima Roma."

If the imagination is whimsical; well at least, 'tis like me to
have imagined it.  Adieu, child! We leave Bologna
to-morrow.  You know 'tis the third city in Italy for
pictures: knowing that, you know all.  We shall be three days
crossing the Apennine to Florence: would it were over!

My dear West, I am yours from St. Peter's to St. Paul's!

(177) Edmund Curll, the well-known bookseller.  The letters
between Pope and many of his friends falling into Curll's hands,
they were by him  printed and sold.  As the volume contained some
letters from noblemen,  Pope incited a prosecution against him in
the House of Lords for breach of privilege; but, when the orders
of the House were examined, none of them appeared to have been
infringed: Curll went away triumphant, and Pope was left to seek
some other remedy.-E.

(178) The Epitaph on the outside of the wall of the church of St.
Proculo-

Si procul `a Proculo Proculi campana fuisset, Jam procul `a
Proculo Proculus ipse foret.  A.D. 1392.



142 Letter 16
To Richard West, Esq.
Florence, Jan. 24, 1740, N. S.

Dear West,
I don't know what volumes I may send you from Rome; from
Florence I have little inclination to send you any.  I see
several things that please me calmly, but `a force d'en avoir vu
I have left off screaming Lord! this! and Lord! that!  To speak
sincerely, Calais surprised me more than any thing I have seen
since.  I recollect the joy I used to propose if I could but once
see the great duke's gallery; I walk into it now with as little
emotion as I should into St. Paul's.  The statues are a
congregation of good sort of people, that I have a great deal of
unruffled regard for.  The farther I travel the less I wonder at
any thing: a few days reconcile one to a new spot, or an unseen
custom; and men are
so much the same every where, that one scarce perceives any
change of situation.  The same weaknesses, the same passions that
in England plunge men into elections, drinking, whoring, exist
here, and show themselves in the shapes of Jesuits,
Cicisbeos, and Corydon ardebat Alexins.  The most remarkable
thing I have observed since I came abroad, is, that there are no
people so obviously mad as the English.  The French, the
Italians, have great follies, great faults; but then they are so
national, they cease to be striking.  In England, tempers vary so
excessively, that almost every one's faults are
peculiar to himself.  I take this diversity to proceed partly
from our climate, partly from our government: the first is
changeable, and makes us queer; the latter permits our
queernesses to operate as they please.  If one
could avoid contracting this queerness, it must certainly be the
most entertaining to live in England, where such a variety of
incidents continually amuse.  The incidents of a week in London
would furnish all Italy with news for a twelvemonth.  The only
two circumstances of moment in the life of an
Italian, that ever give occasion to their being mentioned, are,
being married, and in a year after taking a cicisbeo.  Ask the
name, the husband, the wife, or the cicisbeo, of any person, et
voila qui est fini.
Thus, child, 'tis dull dealing here! Methinks your Spanish war is
little more livel By the gravity of the proceedings, one would
think both nations were Spaniard.  Adieu! Do you
remember my maxim, that you used to laugh at? Every body does
every thing, and nothing comes on't.  I am more convinced of it
now than ever.  I don't know whether S***w,'s was not still
better, Well, gad, there is nothing in nothing.  You see how I
distil all my speculations and improvements, that they may lie in
a small compass.  Do you remember the story of the prince, that,
after travelling three years, brought home nothing but a nut?
They cracked it: in it was wrapped up a piece of silk, painted
with all the kings, queens, kingdoms. and every thing in the
world: after many unfoldings, out stepped a little dog, shook his
ears, and fell to dancing a saraband.  There is a fairy tale for
you.  If I had any thing as good as your old song, I would send
it too; but I can only thank you for it, and bid you good night.
Yours ever.

P. S. Upon reading my letter, I perceive still plainer the
sameness that reigns here; for I find I have said the same thing
ten times over.  I don't care, I have made out a letter, and that
was all my affair.



143 Letter 17
To Richard West, Esq.
Florence, February 27, 1740, N. S.

Well, West, I have found a little unmasqued moment to Write to
you; but for this week past I have been so muffled up in my
domino, that I have not had the command of my elbows.  But what
have you been doing all the mornings?  Could you not
write then?-No, then I was masqued too; I have done nothing but
slip out of my domino into bed, and out of bed into my domino.
The end of the Carnival is frantic, bacchanalian; all the morn
one makes parties in masque to the shops and
coffee-houses, and all the evening to the operas and balls.  Then
I have danced, good gods! how have I danced!  The
Italians are fond to a degree of our country dances: Cold and
raw-they only know by the tune; Blowzybella is almost Italian,
and Buttered peas is Pizelli ag buro.  There are but three days
more; but the two last are to have balls all the morning at the
fine unfinished palace of the Strozzi; and the Tuesday night a
masquerade after supper: they sup first, to eat gras, and not
encroach upon Ash-Wednesday.  What makes masquerading more
agreeable here than in England, is
the great deference that is showed to the disguised.  Here they
do not catch at those little dirty opportunities of
saying any ill-natured thing they know of you, do not abuse you
because they may, or talk gross bawdy to a woman of
quality.  I found the other day, by a play of Etheridge's, that
we have had a sort of Carnival even since the
Reformation; Ytis in "She would if She could," they talk of going
a-mumming in Shrove-tide.(179)-After talking so much of
diversions, I fear you will attribute
to them the fondness I own I contract for Florence; but it has so
many other charms, that I shall not want excuses for
my taste.  The freedom of the Carnival has given me
opportunities to make several acquaintances.; and if I have no
found them refined, learned, polished, like some other cities,
yet they are civil, good-natured, and fond of the English-.
Their little partiality for themselves, opposed to the
violent vanity of the French, makes them very amiable in my eyes.
I can give you a comical instance of their great
prejudice about nobility; it happened yesterday.  While we were
at dinner at Mr. Mann'S. (180) word was brought by his secretary,
that a cavalier demanded audience of him upon an affair of
honour.  Gray and I flew behind the curtain of the door.  An
elderly gentleman, whose attire was not certainly correspondent
to the greatness of his birth, entered, and
informed the British minister, that one Martin. an English
painter, had left a challenge for him at his house, for having
said Martin was no gentleman.  He would by no means have spoke of
the duel before the transaction of it, but that his honour, his
blood, his etc. would never permit him to fight with one who was
no cavalier; which was what he came to inquire of his excellency.
We laughed loud laughs, but unheard: his fright or his nobility
had closed his ears.  But mark the sequel: the instant he was
gone, my very English curiosity hurried me out of the gate St.
Gallo; 'twas
the place and hour appointed.  We had not been driving about
above ten minutes, but out popped a little figure, pale but
cross, with beard unshaved and hair uncombed, a slouched hat, and
a considerable red cloak, in which was wrapped, under his arm,
the fatal sword that was to revenge the highly injured Mr.
Martin, painter and defendant.  I darted my head out of the
coach, just ready to say, " Your servant, Mr. Martin," and talk
about the architecture of the triumphal arch that was building
there; but he would not know me, and walked off.  We left him to
wait for an hour, to grow very cold and very
valiant the more it grew past the hour of appointment.  We were
figuring all the poor creature's huddle of thoughts, and confused
hopes of victory or fame, of his unfinished pictures, or his
situation upon bouncing into the next world.  You will think us
strange creatures; but 'twas a pleasant sight, as we knew the
poor painter was safe.  I have thought of it since, and am
inclined to believe that nothing but two English could have been
capable of such a jaunt.  I remember, 'twas reported in London,
that the plague was at a house in the city, and all the town went
to see it.

I have this instant received your letter.  Lord!  I am glad I
thought of those parallel passages, since it made you
translate them.  'Tis excessively near the original; and yet, I
don't know, 'tis very easy too.-It snows here a little
to-night, but
it never lies but on the mountains.  Adieu!  Yours ever.

P.S. What is the history of the theatres this winter?

(179) Sir Charles Etheridge.  "She would if She could," was
brought out at the Duke of York's theatre in February, 1668:
Pepys, who was present, calls it "a silly, dull thing; the design
and end being mighty insipid."-E.

(180) Sir Horace Mann, created a baronet in 1755. He was
appointed minister plenipotentiary from England to the court of
Florence in 1740, and continued so until his death, on the 6th
November 1786.-E.



145 Letter 18
To The Hon. Henry Seymour Conway, (181)
Florence, March 6, 1740, N. S.


Harry, my dear, one would tell you what a monster you are, if one
were not sure your conscience tells you so every time you think
of me.  At Genoa, in the year of our Lord one
thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine, I received the last
letter from you; by your not writing to me since, I imagine you
propose to make this a leap year.  I should have sent many a
scold after you in this long interval, had I known where to have
scolded; but you told me you should leave Geneva
immediately.  I have despatched sundry inquiries into England
after you, all fruitless.  At last drops in a chance letter to
Lady Sophy Farmor, (182) from a girl at Paris, that tells her for
news, Mr. Henry Conway is here.  Is he, indeed? and why was I to
know it only by this scrambling way? Well, I hate you for this
neglect, but I find I love you well enough to tell you so.  But,
dear now, don't let one fall into a train of excuses and
reproaches; if the god of indolence is a
mightier deity with you than the god of caring for one, tell me,
and I won't dun you; but will drop your correspondence as
silently as if I owed you money.

If my private consistency was of no weight with you, yet, is a
man nothing who is within three days' journey of a conclave?
Nay, for what you knew, I might have been in Rome.  Harry, art
thou so indifferent, as to have a cousin at the election of a
pope (183) without courting him for news? I'll tell you, were I
any where else, and even Dick Hammond were at Rome, I think
verily I should have wrote to him.  Popes, cardinals,
adorations, coronations, St. Peter's!  oh, what costly sounds!
and don't you write to one yet?  I shall set out in about a
fortnight, and pray then think me of consequence.

I have crept on upon time from day to day here; fond of
Florence to a degree: 'tis infinitely the most agreeable of all
the places I have seen since London: that you know one loves,
right or wrong, as one does one's nurse.  Our little Arno is not
bloated and swelling like the Thames, but 'tis vastly pretty,
and, I don't know how, being Italian, has
something visionary and poetical in its stream.  Then one's
unwilling to leave the gallery, and-but-in short, one's
unwilling to get into a postchaise.  I am surfeited with
mountains and inns, as if I had eat them.  I have many to pass
before I see England again, and no Tory to entertain me on the
road?  Well, this thought makes me dull, and that makes me
finish.  Adieu!
Yours ever.

outrageous as to leave me quite off), recornmand4 i Mons.

146 Letter 19
To Richard West, Esq.
Siena, March 22, 1740, N. S.

Dear West, Probably now you will hear something of the
Conclave: we have
left Florence, and are got hither on the way to a pope.  In three
hours' time we have seen all the good contents of this city: 'tis
old, and very snug, with very few inhabitants.  You must not
believe Mr. Addison about the wonderful Gothic nicety of the
dome: the materials are richer, but the workmanship and taste not
near so good as in several I have seen.  We saw a college of the
Jesuits, where there are taught to draw above fifty boys: they
are disposed in long chambers in the manner of Eton, but
cleaner.
N. B. We were not bolstered; (184) so we wished you with us.  Our
Cicerone, who has less classic knowledge, and more
superstition than a colleger, upon showing
147 us the she-wolf, the arms of Siena, told us that Romolus and
Remus were nursed by a wolf, per la volonta di Dio, si pu`o dire;
and that one might see by the arms, that the same founders built
Rome and Siena.  Another dab of Romish superstition, not
unworthy
of Presbyterian divinity, we met with in a book of drawings:
'twas the Virgin standing on a tripod composed of Adam, Eve, and
the Devil, to express her immaculate conception.

You can't imagine how pretty the country is between this and
Florence; millions of little hills planted with trees, and tipped
with villas or convents.  We left unseen the great Duke's
villas
and several palaces in Florence, till our return from Rome: the
weather has been so cold, how could one go to them?  In Italy
they seem to have found out how hot their climate is, but not how
cold; for there are scarce any chimneys, and most of the
apartments painted in fresco so that one has the additional
horror of freezing with imaginary marble.  The men hang little
earthen pans of coals upon their wrists, and the women have
portable stoves under their petticoats to warm their
nakedness,
and carry silver shovels in their pockets, with which their
Cicisbeos stir them-Hush! by them, I mean their stoves.  I have
nothing more to tell you; I'll carry my letter to Rome and finish
it there.

R`e di Coffano, March 23, where lived one of the three kings.
The King of Coffano carried presents of myrrh, gold, and
frankincense, I don't know where the devil he found them; for in
all his dominions we have not seen the value of a shrub.  We have
the honour of lodging under his roof to-night.  lord! such a
place, such an extent of ugliness! A lone inn upon a black
mountain, by the side of an old fortress!  no curtains or
windows, only shutters! no testers to the beds! no earthly thing
to eat but some eggs and a few little fishes! This lovely
spot
is now known by the name of Radi-cofani.  Coming down a steep
hill with two miserable hackneys, one fell under the chaise; and
while we were disengaging him, a chaise came by with a person in
a red cloak, a white handkerchief on its head, and a black hat:
we thought it a fat old woman; but it spoke in a shrill little
pipe, and proved itself to be Senesini. (185) I forgot to tell
you an inscription I copied from the portal of the dome of Siena:

Annus centenus Roma seraper est jubilenus:
Crimina laxantur si penitet ista dortantur; Sic ordinavit
Bonifacius et roboravit.

Rome, March 26

We are this instant arrived, tired and hungry! O! the charming
city-I believe it is-for I have not seen a syllable yet, only the
Pons Milvius and an obelisk.  The Cassian and Flaminian ways were
terrible disappointments; not one Rome tomb left; their very
ruins ruined.  The English are numberless.  My dear West, I know
at Rome you will not have a grain of pity for one; but indeed
'tis dreadful, dealing with schoolboys just broke loose, or old
fools that are come abroad at forty to see the world, like Sir
Wilful Witwould.

I don't know whether you will receive this, or any other I write;
but though I shall write often, you and Ashton must not wonder if
none come to you; for though I am harmless in my nature, my name
has some mystery in it.(186)  Good night! I have no more time or
paper.  Ashton, child, I'll write to you next post.  Write us no
treasons, be sure!

(184) An Eton phrase.

(185) Francesco Bernardi, better known by the name of
Senesino, a celebrated singer, who, having been engaged for the
opera company formed by Handel in 17@20, remained here as
principal singer until 1726, when the state of his health
compelled him to return to Italy.  In 1730 he revisited England,
where he remained until about 1734.  He was the contemporary, if
not the rival of Farinelli; and Mr. Hogarth, in his "Memoirs of
the Musical Drama," (i. 431,) tells us, that when Senesino and
Farinelli were in England together, they had not for some time
the opportunity of hearing each other, in consequence of their
engagements at different theatres.  At last, however, they were
both engaged to sing on the same stage.  Senesino had the part of
a furious tyrant, and Farinelli the part of an unfortunate hero
in chains; but, in the course of the first act, the captive so
softened the heart of the tyrant, that Senesino, forgetting his
stage character, ran to Farinelli, and embraced him in his
own.-E.

(186) He means the name of Walpole at Rome, where the
Pretender and many of his adherents then resided.




148 letter 20
To                     Richard West, Esq.
Rome, April 16th, 1740, N. S.

I'll tell you, West, because one is amongst new things, you think
one can always write new things.  When I first came
abroad, every thing struck me, and I wrote its history: but now I
am grown so used to be surprised, that I don't perceive any
flutter in myself when I meet with any novelties;
curiosity and astonishment wear off, and the next thing is, to
fancy that other people nnow as much of places as One's Self; or,
at least, one does not remember that they do not.  It
appears to me as odd to write to you of St.
Peter's, as it would do to you to write of Westminster Abbey.
Besides, as one looks at churches, etc. with a book of travels in
one's hand, and sees every thing particularized there, it would
appear transcribing, to write upon the same subjects.  I know you
will hate me for this declaration; I remember how ill I used to
take it when any body served me so that was
travelling.  Well, I will tell you something, if you will love
me: You have seen prints of the ruins of the temple of Minerva
Medica; you shall only hear its situation, and then figure what a
villa might be laid out there. 'Tis in the middle of a garden: at
a little distance are two subterraneous grottos, which were the
burial-places of the liberti of Augustus.
There are all the niches and covers of the urns and the
inscriptions remaining; and in one, very considerable remains of
an ancient stucco Ceiling with paintings in grotesque.  Some of
the walks would terminate upon the Castellum Aquae Martioe, St.
John Lateran, and St. Maria Maggiore, besides other churches; the
walls of the garden would be two
aqueducts. and the entrance through one of the old gates of Rome.
This glorious spot is neglected, and only serves for a small
vineyard and kitchen-garden.

I am very glad that I see Rome while it yet exists: before a
great number of years are elapsed, I question whether it will be
worth seeing.  Between the ignorance and poverty of the present
Romans, every thing is neglected and falling to decay; the villas
are entirely out of repair, and the palaces so ill kept, that
half the pictures are spoiled by damp.  At the
villa Ludovisi is a large oracular head of red marble,
colossal, and with vast foramina for the eyes and mouth: the man
that showed the palace said it was un ritratto della
famiglia?  The Cardinal Corsini has
so thoroughly pushed on the misery of Rome by impoverishing it,
that there is no money but paper to be seen.  He is
reckoned to have amassed three millions of crowns.  You may judge
of' the affluence the nobility live in, when I assure you, that
what the chief princes allow for their own eating is a testoon a
day; eighteen pence: there are some extend their expense to five
pauls, or half a crown: Cardinal Albani is called extravagant for
laying out ten pauls for his dinner and supper.  You may imagine
they never have any entertainments: so far from it, they never
have any company.  The princesses and duchesses particularly lead
the dismallest of lives.
Being the posterity of popes, though of worse families than the
ancient nobility, they expect greater
respect than my ladies the countesses and marquises will pay
them; consequently they consort not, but mope in a vast palace
with two mniserable tapers, and two or three monsignori, whom
they are forced to court and humour, that they may not be
entirely deserted.  Sundays they do issue forth in a most
unwieldy coach to the Corso.

In short 'child, after sunset one passes one's time here very
ill; and if I did not wish for you in the mornings, it would be
no compliment to tell you that I do in the evening.  Lord! how
many English I could change for you, and yet buy you
wondrous cheap! And, then French and Germans I could fling into
the bargain by dozens.  Nations swarm here.  You will have a
great fat French cardinal garnished with thirty abb`es roll into
the area of St. Peter's, gape, turn short, and talk of the chapel
of Versailles.  I heard one of them say t'other day, he had been
at the Capitale.  One asked of course how he liked it-.Oh! il y a
assez de belles choses.

Tell Ashton I have received his letter, and will write next post
but I am in a violent hurry and have no more time; so Gray
finishes this delicately.

NOT so delicate; nor indeed would his conscience suffer him to
write to you, till he received de vos nouvelles, if he had not
the tail of another person's letter to use by way of evasion.  I
sha'n't describe, as being in the only place in the world that
deserves it which may seem an odd reason-but they say as how it's
fulsome, and every body does it (and I suppose every body says
the same thing); else I should tell'you a vast deal about the
Coliseum, and the Conclave, and the Capitol, and these matters.
A-propos du Colis`ee, if you don't know what it is, the Prince
Borghese will be very capable of giving you some account of it,
who told an Englishman that asked what it was built for: "They
say 'twas for Christians to fight with tigers in."  We are just
come from adoring a great piece of the true cross, St. Longinus's
spear, and St. Veronica's handkerchief; all of which have been
this evening exposed to view in St. Peter's.  In the same place,
and on the same occasion last night, Walpole saw a poor
creature naked to the waist discipline himself with a scourge
filled with iron prickles, till he made hii-nself a raw
doublet, that he took for red satin torn, and showing the skin
through.  I should tell you, that he fainted away three times at
the sight, and I twice
and a half at the repetition of it.  All this is performed by the
light of a vast fiery cross, composed of hundreds of
little crystal latmps, which appears through the great altar
under the grand tribuna, as if hanging by itself in the air.  All
the confraternities of the city resort thither in solemn
procession, habited in linen frocks, girt with a cord, and their
heads covered with a cowl all over, that has only two holes
before to see through.  Some of these are all black, others
parti-coloured and white: and with these masqueraders that vast
church is filled, who are seen thumping their
breasts, and kissing the pavement with extreme devotion.  But
methinks I am describing:-'tis an ill habit; but this, like every
thing else will wear off We have sent you our compliments by a
friend of yours, and correspondent in a corner, who seems a very
agreeable man; one Mr. Williams; I am sorry he staid so little a
while in Rome.  I forget Porto-Bello (187)  all this while; pray
let us know where it is, and whether you or Ashton had any hand
in the taking of'it.  Duty to the admiral.  Adieu! Ever yours,

T. GRAY.

(187) Porto-Bello, taken from the Spaniards by Admiral Vernon,
with six ships only, On the 21st Nov. 1740.  By the articles of
the capitulation, the town was not to be plundered, nor the
inhabitants molested in the smallest degree; and the governor and
inhabitants expressed themselves in the highest terms, when
speaking of the humanity and generosity with which they had been
treated by the admiral and the officers of the
squadron under his command.-E.



150 Letter 21
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Rome, April, 23, 1740, N. S.

As I have wrote you two such long letters lately, my dear Hal, I
did not hurry myself to answer your last; but choose to write to
poor SelWyn (188) Upon his illness.  I pity you excessively upon
finding him in such a situation- what a shock it must have been
to you!  He deserves so much love from all that know him, and you
owe him so much friendship, that I can scarce conceive a greater
shock.  I am very glad you did not write to me till he was out of
danger; for this great distance would have added to my pain, as I
must have waited so long for another letter.  I charge you, don't
let him relapse into balls: he does not love them, and, if you
please, your example may keep him out of them.  You are extremely
pretty people to be dancing and trading with French poulterers
and pastry cooks, when a hard frost is starving half the nation,
and the Spanish war ought to be employing the other half.  We are
much more public spirited here; we live upon the public news, and
triumph abundantly upon the taking Porto-Bello.  If you are not
entirely debauched with your balls, you must be pleased with an
answer of Lord Harrington's (189) to the governor of
Rome.  He asked him what they had determined about the
vessel that the Spaniards took under the canon of Civita
Vecchia, whether they had restored it to the English?  The
governor said, they had done justice.  My lord replied, "If you
had not, we should have' done it ourselves."  Pray
reverence our spirit, Lieutenant Hal.

Sir, MoscovitEO (190) is not a pretty woman, and she does
sing ill; that's all.

My dear Harry, I must now tell you a little about myself,
and answer your questions.  How I like the inanimate part of Rome
you will soon perceive at my arrival in England; I am far gone in
medals, lamps, idols, prints, etc." and all the small commodities
to the purchase of which I can attain; I would buy the Coliseum
if I could: Judge.  My mornings are spent in the most agreeable
manner; my evenings ill enough.  Roman conversations are dreadful
things! such untoward
mawkins as the princesses! and the princes are worse.  Then the
whole city is littered with French and German abb`es,
who make up a dismal contrast with the inhabitants.  The
conclave is far from enlivening us; its secrets don't
transpire.  I could give you names of this cardinal and
that, that are talked of, but each is contradicted the next hour.
I was there t'other day to visit one of them, and one of the most
agreeable, Alexander Albani.  I had the
opportunity of two cardinals making their entry: upon that
occasion the gate is unlocked, and their eminences come to talk
to their acquaintance over the threshold.  I have
received great civilities from him I named to you, and I
wish he were out, that I might receive greater: a friend of his
does the honours of Rome for him; but you know that it is
unpleasant to visit by proxy.  Cardinal Delei, the object of the
Corsini faction, is dying; the hot weather will probably despatch
half a dozen more. Not that it is hot yet; I am now writing to
you by my fireside.

Harry, you saw Lord Deskfoord (191) at Geneva; don't you
like him?  He is a mighty sensible man.  There are few young
people have so good understandings.  He is mighty grave, and so
are you; but you can both be pleasant when you have a
mind.  Indeed, one can make you pleasant, but his solemn
Scotchery is a little formidable: before you 1 can play the fool
from morning to night, courageously.  Good night.  I
have other letters to write, and must finish this.
Yours ever.

(190) Notwithstanding she laboured under such
disadvantages-and want of beauty and want of talent are
serious ones to a cantatrice,-it will be seen from Walpole's
letter to Mann, 5th Nov. 1741, that the Moscovita, on her

152 Letter 22
To Richard West, Esq.
Rome, May 7, 1740, N. S.

Dear West,
'Twould be quite rude and unpardonable in one not to wish you joy
upon the great conquests that you are all committing all over the
world.  We heard the news last night from Naples, that Admiral
Haddock (192) had met the Spanish convoy going to Majorca, and
taken it all, all; three thousand men, three
colonels, and a Spanish grandee.  We conclude it is true, for the
Neapolitan Majesty mentioned it at dinner.  We are going thither
in about a week, to wish him joy of it too.  'Tis with some
apprehensions we go too, of having a pope chosen in the interim:
that would be cruel, you know.  But, thank our stars, there is no
great probability of it.  ' Feuds and contentions run high among
the eminences.  A notable one happened this week.  Cardinal
Zinzendorff and two more had given their votes for the general of
the Capucins: he is of the Barberini
family, not a cardinal, but a worthy man.  Not effecting any
thing, Zinzendorff voted for Coscia, and declared it publicly.
Cardinal Petra reproved him; but the German replied, he
thought Coscia as fit to be pope as any of them.  It seems, his
pique to the whole body is, their having denied a daily admission
of a pig into the conclave for
his eminence's use who, being much troubled with the gout, was
ordered by his mother to bathe his leg in pig's blood every
morning.

Who should have a vote t other day but the Cardinalino of
Toledo!  Were he older, the Queen of Spain might possibly
procure more than one for him, though scarcely enough.

Well, but we won't talk Politics: shall we talk antiquities?
Gray and I discovered a considerable curiosity lately.  In an
unfrequented quarter of the Colonna garden lie two immense
fragments of marble, formerly part of a frieze to some building;
'tis not known of what.  They are of Parian marble: which may
give one some idea of the magnificence of the rest of the
building for these pieces were at the very top.  Upon inquiry, we
were told they had been measured by an architect, who declared
they were larger than any member of St. Peter's.  The length of
one of the pieces is above sixteen feet.  They were formerly sold
to a stonecutter for five thousand crowns, but Clement XI. would
not permit them to be sawed, annulled the bargain, and laid a
penalty of twelve thousand crowns upon the family if they parted
with them.  I think it was a right judged thing.  Is it not
amazing, that so vast a structure should not be known of, or that
it should be so entirely destroyed?  But indeed at Rome this is a
common surprise; for, by the remains one sees of the Roman
grandeur in their structures, 'tis evident that there must have
been more pains taken to destroy those piles than to raise them.
They are more demolished than any time or chance could have
effected.  I am persuaded that in an hundred years Rome will not
be worth seeing; 'tis less so now than one would believe.  All
the public pictures are decayed or decaying; the few ruins cannot
last long; and the statues and private collections must be sold,
from the great poverty of the families.  There are now selling no
less than three of the principal collections, the Barberini, the
Sacchetti, and Ottoboni: the latter
belonged to the cardinal who died in the conclave.  I must give
you an instance of his generosity, or rather ostentation.  When
Lord Carlisle was here last year, who is a great
virtuoso, he asked leave to see the cardinal's collection of
cameos and intaglios.  Ottoboni gave leave, and ordered the
person who showed them to observe which my lord admired most.  My
lord admired many: they were all sent him the next morning. He
sent the cardinal back a fine gold repeater; who returned him an
acate snuff box, and more cameoes of ten
times the value.  Voila qui est fini!  Had my lord produced more
golden repeaters, it would have been begging more cameos.
Adieu, my dear West! You see I write often and much, as you
desired it.  Do answer one now and then, with any little job that
is done in England.  Good night.  Yours ever.

fact, that on the 18th of April his Majesty's ships Lenox, Kent,

153 Letter 23
To Richard West, Esq.
Naples, June 14, 1740, N. S.


Dear West,
One hates writing descriptions that are to be found in every book
of travels; but we have seen something to-day that I am sure you
never read of, and perhaps never heard of.  Have
you ever heard of a subterraneous town? a whole Roman town, with
all its edifices, remaining under ground? Don't fancy the
inhabitants buried it there to save it from the Goths: they were
buried with it themselves; which is a caution we are not told
that they ever took.  You remember in Titus's time there  were
several cities destroyed by an eruption of Vesuvius,
attended with an earthquake.  Well, this was one of them, not
very considerable, and then called Herculaneum. (195)  Above it
has since been built Portici, about three miles from
Naples, where the King has a villa.  This under-ground city is
perhaps one of the noblest curiosities that ever has been
discovered.  It was found out by chance, about a year and half
ago.  They began digging, they found statues; they dug,
further, they found more.  Since that they have made a
very considerable progress, and find continually.  You may walk
the compass of a mile; but by the misfortune of the
modern town being overhead, they are obliged to proceed with
great caution, lest they destroy both one and t'other.  By this
occasion the path is very narrow, just wide enough and high
enough for one man to walk upright.  They have hollowed, as they
found it easiest to work, and have carried their
streets not exactly where were the ancient ones, but sometimes
before houses, sometimes through them.  You would imagine that
all the fabrics were crushed together; on the contrary.,
except some columns, they have found all the edifices standing
upright in their proper ' situation.  There is one inside of a
temple quite perfect, with the middle arch, two columns, and two
pilasters.  It is built of brick plastered over, and
painted with architecture almost all the insides of the houses
are in the same manner; and, what is very particular the
general ground of all the painting is red.  Besides this
temple, they make out very plainly an amphitheatre: the
stairs, of white marble and the seats are very perfect; the
inside was painted in the same colour with the private houses,
and great part cased with white marble.  They have found among
other things some fine statues, some human bones, some rice,
medals, and a few paintings
extremely fine.  These latter are preferred to all the ancient
paintings that have ever been discovered.  We have not seen them
yet, as they are kept in the King's apartment, whither all these
curiosities are transplanted; and 'tis difficult to see them-but
we shall.  I forgot to tell you, that in several places the beams
of the houses remain, but burnt to charcoal; so little damaged
that they retain visibly the grain of the wood, but upon touching
crumble to ashes.  What is remarkable, there are no other marks
or appearance of fire, but what are visible on these beams.

There might certainly be collected great light from this
reservoir of antiquities, if a man of learning had the
inspection of it; if he directed the working, and would make a
journal of the discoveries.  But I believe there is no
judicious choice made of directors.  There is nothing of the kind
known in the world; I mean a Roman city entire of that age, and
that has not been corrupted with modern repairs.
(196) Besides scrutinising this very carefully, I should be
inclined to search for the remains of the other towns that were
partners with this in the general ruin.  'Tis certainly an
advantage to the learned  world, that this has been laid up so
long.  Most of the discoveries in Rome were made in a
barbarous age, where they only ransacked the ruins in quest of
treasure, and had no regard to the form and being of the
building; or to any circumstances that might give light to its
use and history.  I shall finish this long account with a
passage which Gray has observed in Statius, and which
correctly pictures out this latent city:-

Haec ego Chalcidicis ad te, Marcelle, sonabam
Littoribus, fractas ubi Vestius egerit iras,
Emula Trinacriis volvens incendia flammis.
Mira fides! credetne viram ventura propago,
Cum segetes iterum, cum jam haec deserta virebunt,
Infra urbes populosque premi?
SyLv. lib. iv. epist. 4.

Adieu, my dear West! and believe me yours ever.

(195) Some excavations were made at Herculaneum in 1709
by the Prince d'Elbeuf; but, thirty years elapsed after the
prince had been forbidden to dig further, before any more
notice was taken of them.  In December 1738 the King of the two
Sicilies was at Portici, and gave orders for the
prosecution of these subterranean labours.  There had been an
excavation in the time of the Romans;
and another so lately as 1689.  In a letter from Gray
to his mother, he describes their visits to Herculaneum;
but, not mentioning it by name, Mason supposed it had not then
been discovered to be that city.  It is evident, from this
observation of Walpole, that Mason's opinion was unfounded.-E.

  (196) Pompei a was not then discovered.



155 Letter 24
To The Hon.  H. S. Conway.
R`e di Cofano, vulg.  Radicofani, July 5, 1740, N. S.

You will wonder, my dear Hal, to find me on the road from
Rome: why, intend I did to stay for a new popedom, but the old
eminences are cross and obstinate, and will not choose one the
Holy Ghost does not know when.  There is a horrid thing called
the mallaria, that comes to Rome, every summer, and kills one,
and I did not care for being killed so far from Christian burial.
We have been jolted to death; my servants let us
come without springs to the chaise, and we are wore
threadbare: to add to our disasters, I have sprained my ancle,
and have brought it along, laid upon a little box of baubles that
I have bought for presents in England.  Perhaps I may pick you
out some little trifle there, but don't depend upon it; you are a
disagreeable creature and may be I shall not care for you.
Though I am so tired in this devil of a place, yet I have taken
it into my head, that it is like Hamilton's Bawn, (197) and I
must write to you.  'Tis the top of a black barren mountain, a
vile little town at the foot of an old citadel: yet this, know
you, was the residence of one of the three kings that went to
Christ's birth-day; his name was Alabaster, Abarasser, or some
such thing; the other two were kings, one of the East, the other
of Cologn.  'Tis this of Cofano, who was represented in an
ancient painting found in the Palatine Mount, now in the
possession of Dr. Mead; he was crowned by Augustus.  Well, but
about writing-what do you think I write with? Nay, with a pen;
there was never a one to be found in the whole
circumference but one, and that was in the possession of the
governor, and had been used time out of mind to write
the parole with : I was forced to send to borrow it. It was sent
me under the conduct of a sergeant and two Swiss, with  desire to
return it when I should have done with it.  'Tis a curiosity, and
worthy to be laid up with the relics
which we have just been seeing- in a small hovel of
Capucins, on the side of the hill, and which were all brought by
his Majesty from Jerusalem.  Among other things of great sanctity
there is a set of gnashing of teeth, the grinders very entire; a
bit of the worm that never dies, preserved in spirits; a crow of
St. Peter's cock, very useful against
Easter; the crisping and curling, frizzling and frowncing of Mary
Magdalen, which she cut off on growing devout.  The good man that
showed us all these commodities was got into such a train of
calling them the blessed this, and blessed that, that at last he
showed us a bit of the blessed fig-tree that Christ cursed.

Florence, July 9.

My dear Harry,
We are come hither, and I have received another letter from you
with Hosier's Ghost.  Your last put me in pain for you, when you
talked of going to Ireland; but now I find your
brother and sister go with you, I am not much concerned.
Should I be?  You have but to say, for my feelings are
extremely at your service to dispose as you please.  Let us see:
you are to come back to stand for some
place; that will be about April.  'Tis a sort of thing I
should do, too; and then we should see one another, and that
would be charming; but it is a sort of thing I have no mind to
do; and then we shall not see one another, unless you
would come hither-but that you cannot do: nay, I would not have
you, for then I shall be gone.  So! there are many @
that just signify nothing at all.  Return I must sooner than I
shall like.  I am happy here to a degree.  I'll tell you my
situation.  I am lodged with Mr. Mann, (198) the best of
creatures.  I have a terreno all to myself, with an open
gallery on the Arno, where I am now writing to you.  Over
against me is the famous Gallery; and, on either hand, two fair
bridges.  Is not this charming and cool?  The air is so serene,
and so secure, that one sleeps with all the windows and doors
thrown open to the river, and only covered with a slight gauze to
keep away the gnats.  Lady Pomfret
(199) has a charming conversation once a week.  She has
taken a vast palace and a vast garden, which is vastly
commode, especially to the cicisbeo-part of mankind, who have
free indulgence to wander in pairs about the arbours.  You know
her daughters : Lady Sophia (200) is still, nay she must be, the
beauty she was: Lady Charlotte, (201) is much improved, and is
the cleverest girl in the world; speaks the purest Tuscan, like
any Florentine.  The
Princess Craon (202) has a constant pharaoh and supper every
night, where one is quite at one's ease.  I am going into the
country with her and the prince for a little while, to a villa of
the Great Duke's.  The people are good-humoured here and easy;
and what makes me pleased with them, they are pleased with me.
One loves to find people care for one, when they can have no view
in it.

You see how glad I am to have reasons for not returning; I wish I
had no better.

As to Hosier's Ghost, (203) I think it very easy, and
consequently pretty; but, from the ease, should never have
guessed it Glover's.  I delight in your, "the patriots cry it up,
and the courtiers cry it down, and the hawkers cry it up and
down," and your laconic history of the King and Sir
Robert, on going to Hanover, and turning out the Duke of
Argyle.  The epigram, too, you sent me
on the same occasion is charming.

Unless I sent you back news that you and others send me, I can
send you none.  I have left the conclave, which is the only
stirring thing in this part of the world, except the child that
the Queen of Naples is to be delivered of in August.  There is no
likelihood the conclave will end, unless the messages take effect
which 'tis said the Imperial and
French ministers have sent to their respective courts for
leave to quit the Corsini for the Albani faction: otherwise there
will never be a pope.  Corsini has
lost the only one he could have ventured to make pope, and him he
designed; 'twas Cenci, a relation of the Corsini's
mistress.  The last morning Corsini made him rise, stuffed a dish
of chocolate down his throat, and would carry him to
the scrutiny.  The poor old creature went, came back, and
died.  I am sorry to have lost the sight of the pope's
coronation, but I might have stayed for seeing it till I had been
old enough to be pope myself.

Harry, what luck the chancellor has! first, indeed, to be in
himself so great a man; but then in accidents: he is
made chief justice and peer, when Talbot is made chancellor and
peer: (204) Talbot dies in a twelvemonth, and leaves him the
seals at an age when others are scarce made solicitors:
(205)-then marries his son into one of the first families of
Britain, (206) obtains a patent for a marquisate and eight
thousand pounds a year after the Duke of Kent's death: the duke
dies in a fortnightt, and leaves them all! People talk of
Fortune's wheel, that is always rolling: my Lord Hardwicke has
overtaken her wheel, and rolled with it.  I perceive Miss Jenny
(207) would not venture to Ireland, nor stray so far from London;
I am glad I shall always know where to find her within threescore
miles.  I must say a word to my lord, which, Harry, be sure you
don't read. ["My dear lord, I don't love troubling you with
letters, because I know you don't love the trouble of answering
them; not that I should insist on that ceremony, but I hate to
burthen any one's conscience.  Your brother tells me he is to
stand member of parliament: without telling me so, I am sure he
owes it to you.  I am sure you will not repent setting him up;
nor will he be ungrateful to a brother who deserves so much, and
whose least merit is not the knowing how to employ so great a
fortune."]

There, Harry,-I have done.  Don't suspect me: I have said no ill
of you behind your back.  Make my
best compliments to Miss Conway. (208)

I thoght I had done, and lo, I had forgot to tell you, that who
d'ye think is here?-Even Mr. More! our Rheims Mr.
More!  the fortification, hornwork, ravelin, bastion Mr.
More! which is very pleasant sure.  At the end of the eighth
side, I think I need make no excuse for leaving off; but I am
going to write to Selwyn, and to the lady of the mountain; from
whom I have had a very kind letter.  She has at last
received the Chantilly brass. Good night: write to me from one
end of the world to t'other.  Yours ever.

(197) A large old house, two miles from the seat of Sir
Arthur Acheson, near Market-hill, and the scene of Swift's
humorous poem, "The Grand Question debated, whether
Hamilton's Bawn should be turned into a barrack or a malt-
house."-E.

(198) Afterwards Sir Horace Mann.  He was at this time
resident at Florence from George II.

(199) Henrietta Louisa, wife of Thomas Earl of Pomfret. [She was
the daughter of John Lord Jefferies, Baron of Wem.  Lady Pomfret,
who was the friend and correspondent of Frances
Duchess of Somerset, retired from the court upon the death of
Queen Caroline in 1737.]

(200) Afterwards married to John Lord Carteret, who became Earl
of Granville on the death of his mother in the year 1744.

(201) Lady Charlotte Fermor married, in August 1746, William
Finch, brother of Daniel seventh Earl of Winchelsea, by whom she
had issue a son, George, who, on the death of his uncle, in 1769,
succeeded to the earldom.  Her ladyship was governess to the
children of George III., and highly esteemcd by him and his royal
consort.-E.

(202) The Princess Craon was the favourite mistress of
Leopold the last Duke of Lorrain, who married her to M. de
Beauveau, and prevailed on the Emperor to make him a prince of
the empire.  They at this time resided at Florence, where Prince
Craon was at the head of the council of regency.

(203) This was a party ballad (written by Glover, though by some
at the time ascribed to Lord Bath,) on the taking of
Porto-Bello by Admiral Vernon.  "The case of Hosier," says
Bishop Percy, in his admirable Reliques, vol. ii. p. 382,
where the song is preserved, "The case of Hosier, which is here
so pathetically represented, was briefly this.  In
April 1726, that commander was sent with a strong fleet into the
Spanish West Indies to block up the galleons in the port of that
country, or, should they presume to come out, to
seize and carry them to England: he accordingly arrived at
Bastimentos, near Porto-Bello; but, being employed rather to
overawe than attack the Spaniards, with whom it was probably not
our interest to go to war, he continued long inactive on this
station.  He afterwards removed to Carthagena, and
remained crusing in those seas, till the greater part of his men
perished deplorably by the diseases of that unhealthy
Climate.  This brave man, seeing his best officers and men thus
daily swept away, his ships exposed to inevitable
destruction, and himself made the sport of the enemy, is
said to have died of a broken heart.-E.

(204) Philip Yorke Lord Hardwicke was the son of an attorney at
Dover, and was introduced by the Duke of Newcastle to Sir Robert
Walpole.  He was attorney-general, and when Talbot, the
solicitor-general, was preferred to him in the contest for the
chancellorship, Sir Robert made him chief justice
for life, with an increased salary.  He was an object of
aversion to Horace Walpole, who, in his Memoirs, tells us, "in
the House of Lords, he was laughed at, in the cabinet
despised." Upon which it is very properly observed by the
noble editor of those memoirs, Lord Hollan,-"Yet, in the
course of the work, Walpole laments Lord Hardwicke's
influence in the cabinet, where he would have us believe
that he was despised, and acknowledges that he exercised a
dominion nearly absolute over that house of Parliament
which, he would persuade his readers, laughed at him.  The truth
is, that, wherever this great magistrate is mentioned, Lord
Orford's resentments blind his judgment and disfigure his
narrative."-E.


(205) charles Talbot baron Talbot was, on the 29th Nov.
1733, made lord high chancellor and created a baron; and,
dying in Feb. 1737, was succeeded by Lord Hardwicke.  There is a
story current, that Sir Robert Walpole, finding it
difficult to prevail on Yorke to quit a place for life, for the
higher but more precarious dignity of chancellor, worked upon his
jealousy, and said that if he persisted in refusing the seals, he
must offer them to Fazakerly. "Fazakerly!"
exclaimed Yorke, "impossible! he is certainly a Tory,
perhaps a Jacobite."  "It's all very true," replied Sir
Robert, taking out his watch; " but if by one o'clock you do not
accept my offer, Fazakerly by two becomes lord keeper of the
great seal, and one of the staunchest Whigs in all
England!" Yorke took the seals and the peerage.-E.

(206) That of Grey, Duke of Kent, see avove.-E.

(207) Miss Jane Conway, half-sister to Henry Seymour Conway.  She
died unmarried in 1749.

(208) Afterwirds married to John Harris, Esq. of
Hayne in Devonshire.



159 Letter 25
To Richard West, Esq.
Florence, July 31, 1740, N. S.

Dear West,
I have advised with the most notable antiquarians of this city on
the meaning of Thur gut Luetis.  I can get no satisfactory
interpretation.  In my own opinion 'tis Welsh.  I don't love
offering conjectures on a language in which I have hitherto made
little proficiency, but I will trust you with my
explication.  You know the famous Aglaughlan, mother of
Cadwalladhor, was renowned for her conjugal virtues, and grief on
the death of her royal spouse.  I conclude this medal was struck
in her regency, by her express order, to the memory of her lord,
and that the inscription Thur gut Luetis means no more than her
dear Llewis or Llewellin.

In return for your coins I send you two or three of different
kinds.  The first is a money of one of the kings of Naples; the
device, a horse; the motto, Equitas regni.  This curious pun is
on a coin in the Great Duke's collection, and by great chance I
have met with a second.  Another is, a satirical
medal struck on Lewis XIV.; 'tis a bomb, covered with
flower-de-luces, bursting; the motto, Se ipsissimo.  The last,
and almost the only one I ever saw with a text well applied, is a
German medal with a Rebellious town besieged and blocked up; the
inscription, This kind is not expelled but by fasting.
Now I mention medals, have they yet struck the intended one on
the taking of Porto-Bello?  Admiral Vernon will shine in our
medallic history.  We have just received the news of the
bombarding Carthagena, and the taking Chagre. (209)  We are in
great expectation of some important victory obtained by the
squadron under Sir John Norris.  we are told the Duke is to be of
the expedition; is it true? (210)  All the letters, too, talk of
France suddenly declaring war; I hope they will defer it for a
season, or one shall be obliged to return through Germany.

The conclave still subsists, and the divisions still increase; it
was very near separating last week, but by breaking into two
popes; they were on the dawn of a schism.  Aldovrandi had
thirty-three voices for three days, but could not procure the
requisite two more; the Camerlingo having engaged his faction to
sign a protestation against him and each party were
inclined to elect.  I don't know whether one should wish for a
schism or not; it might probably rekindle the zeal for the church
in the powers of Europe which has been so far decaying.
On Wednesday we expect a third she-meteor.  Those learned
luminaries the Ladies Pomfret and Walpole are to be joined by the
Lady Mary Wortley Montague.  You have not been witness to the
rhapsody of mystic nonsense which these two fair ones
debate incessantly, and consequently cannot figure what must be
the issue of this triple alliance: we have some idea of it.  Only
figure the coalition of prudery, debauchery, sentiment, history,
Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and metaphysics; all, except the
second, understood by halves, by quarters, or not at all.  You
shall have the journals of this notable academy.  Adieu, my dear
West! Yours ever,

Hor. Walpole.

Though far unworthy to enter into so learned and political a
correspondence, I am employed pour barbouiller une page
de 7 pounces et demie en hauteur, et `a en largeur; and to inform
you that we are at Florence, a city of Italy, and the capital of
Tuscany: the latitude I cannot justly tell, but it is governed by
a prince called Great Duke; an excellent place to employ all
one's animal sensations in, but utterly contrary to one's
rational powers.  I have struck a medal upon myself: the device
is thus 0, and the motto Nihilissimo, which I take in the most
concise manner to contain a full account of my person,
sentiments, occupations, and late glorious successes.  If you
choose to be annihilated too, you cannot do better than undertake
this journey.  Here you shall get up at twelve
o'clock, breakfast till three, dine till five, sleep till six,
drink cooling liquors till eight, go to the bridge till ten, sup
till two, and so sleep till twelve again.

Lahore fessi venimus ad larem nostrum,
Desideratoque acquiescimus lecto;
Hoc est, quod unum est, pro laborious tantis.
O quid solutis est beatius curis?

We shall never come home again; a universal war is just upon the
point of breaking out; all outlets will be
shut up.  I shall be secure in my nothingness, while you, that
will be so absurd as to exist, will envy me.  You don't tell me
what proficiency you make in the noble science of defence.  Don't
you start still at the sound of a gun? Have you learned to say
ha! ha! and is your neck clothed with thunder?  Are your whiskers
of a tolerable length? And have you got drunk yet with brandy and
gunpowders?  Adieu, noble captain!
T. GRAY.

(209) On the 24th March, 1740, the Spaniards hung out a white
flag, and the place was surrendered by capitulation to Admiral
Vernon.-E.

(210) The Duke of Cumberland had resolved to accompany Sir John
Norris as a volunteer, and sailed with him from St.
Helens on the 10th June; but on the 17th a gale arising drove
them into Torbay, Where Sir John continued until the 29th, when
he again put to sea; but the wind once more becoming
contrary, and blowing very hard, he was constrained to return to
Spithead, and on the following day his royal highness
returned to London.-E.



161 Letter 26
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Florence, September 25, 1740, N. S.

My dear Hal,
I begin to answer your letter the moment I have read it,
because you bid me; but I grow so unfit for a correspondence with
any body in England, that I have almost left it off.  'Tis so
long since I was there, and I am so utterly a stranger to every
thing that passes there, that I must talk vastly in the dark to
those I write: and having in a manner settled
myself here, where there can be no news, I am void of all
matter for filling up a letter.  As, by the absence of the Great
Duke, Florence is become in a manner a country town, YOU may
imagine that we are not without dem`el`es; but for a
country town I believe there never were a set of people so
peaceable, and such strangers to scandal.  'Tis the family of
love, where every body is paired, and go as constantly
together as paroquets.  Here nobody hangs or drowns
themselves; they are not ready to cut one another's throats about
elections or parties; don't think that wit consists in saying
bold truths, or humour in getting
drunk.  But I shall give you no more of their characters,
because I am so unfortunate as to think that their encomium
consists in being the reverse of the English, who in general are
either mad, or enough to make other people so.  After
telling you so fairly my sentiments, you may believe, my dear
Harry, that I had rather see you here than in England.  'Tis an
evil wish for you, who should not be lost in so obscure a place
as this.  I will not make you compliments, or else here is a
charming opportunity for saying what I think of you.  As I am
convinced you love me, and as I am conscious you have One strong
reason for it, I will own to you, that for my own peace you
should wish me to remain here.  I am so well within and without,
that you would scarce know me: I am younger than ever, think of
nothing but diverting myself, and live in a round of pleasures.
We have operas, concerts, and balls,
mornings and evenings.  I dare not tell you all One's
idleness: you would look so grave and senatorial at hearing that
one rises at eleven in the morning, goes to the opera at nine at
night, to supper at one, and to bed at three! But
literally here the evenings and nights are so charming and so
warm, one can't avoid 'em.

Did I tell you Lady Mary Wortley is here? She laughs at my Lady
Walpole, scolds my Lady Pomfret, and is laughed at by the whole
town. (211)  Her dress, her avarice, and her impudence must amaze
any one that never heard her name.  She wears a foul mob, that
does not cover her greasy black locks, that hang loose, never
combed or curled; an old mazarine blue
wrapper, that gapes open and discovers a canvass petticoat.  Her
face swelled violently on one side with the remains of a-, partly
covered with a plaster, and partlv with white paint, which for
cheapness she has bought so coarse, that you would not use it to
wash a chimney.-In three words I will give you her picture (212)
as we drew it in the Sortes Virgilianae-
Insanam vatem aepicies.

I give you my honour, we did not choose it; but Mr. Gray, Mr.
Cooke, (213) Sir Francis Dashwood, (214) and I, and several
others, drew it fairly amongst a thousand for different
people, most of which did not hit as you may imagine: those that
did I will tell you.

For our most religious and gracious-
-Dii, talem terris avertite pestem.

For one that would be our most religious and gracious.

quality."  See the edition of her works, edited by Lord
Wharncliffe, vol. ii. p. 325.-E.

(212) The following favourable picture" of Lady Mary is by
Spence, who met her at Rome, in the ensuing January:-" She is one
of the most shining characters in the world, but shines like a
comet; she is all irregularity, and always wandering; the most

cruellest woman in the world; 'all things by turns, and nothing
long.'"-E.

163 Letter 27
To Sir Richard West, Esq.
Florence, Oct. 2, 1740, N. S.

Dear West,
T'other night as we (you know who we are) were walking on
the charming bridge, just before going to a wedding assembly, we
said, Lord, I wish, just as we are got into the room, they would
call us out, and say, West is arrived!  We would make him dress
instantly, and carry him back to the entertainment.  How he would
stare and wonder at a thousand things, that no longer strike us
as odd!" Would not you? One agreed that you should come directly
by sea from Dover, and be set down at Leghorn, without setting
foot in any other foreign town, and so land at Us, in all your
first full amaze; for you are to know, that astonishment rubs off
violently; we did not cry out Lord! half so much at Rome as at
Calais, which to this hour I look upon as one of the most
surprising cities in the
universe.  My dear child, what if you were to take this little
sea-jaunt?  One would recommend Sir John Norris's convoy to you,
but one should be laughed at now for supposing that he is ever to
sail beyond Torbay.(215)  The Italians take Torbay for an English
town in the hands of the Spaniards, after the
fashion of Gibraltar, and imagine 'tis a wonderful strong
place, by our fleet's having retired from before it so often, and
so often returned.  We went to this wedding that I told you of;
'twas a charming feast: a large palace finely
illuminated; there were all the beauties, all the jewels, and all
the sugarplums of Florence.  Servants loaded with great chargers
full of comfits heap the tables with them, the women fall on with
both hands, and stuff their pockets and every creek and corner
about them.  You would be as much amazed at us as at any thing
you saw: instead of being deep in the arts, and being in the
Gallery every morning, as I thought
of course to be sure I would be, we are in all the idleness and
amusements of the town.  For me, I am grown so lazy, and so
tired-of seeing sights, that, though I have been at
Florence six months, I have not seen Leghorn, Pisa, Lucca, or
Pistoia; nay, not so much as one of the Great Duke's
villas.  I have contracted so great an aversion to
postchaises, and have so absolutely lost all curiosity, that,
except the towns in the straight road to Great Britain, I
shall scarce see a jot more of a foreign land; and trust me, when
I returt), I will not visit the Welsh mountains, like Mr.
Williams.  After Mount Cenis, the Boccheto, the Giogo,
Radicofani, and the Appian Way, one has mighty little hunger
after travelling.  I shall be mighty apt to set up my staff at
Hyde Park corner: the alehouseman there at Hercules's
Pillars(216) was certainly returned from his travels into
foreign parts.

Now I'll answer your questions.

I have made no discoveries in ancient or modern arts.  Mr.
Addison travelled through the poets, and not through Italy; for
all his ideas are borrowed from the descriptions, and not from
the reality.  He saw places as they were, not as they are.  I am
very well acquainted with Dr. Cocchi; (217) he is a good sort of
man, rather than a great man; he is a plain
honest creature, with quiet knowledge, but I dare say all the
English have told you, he has a very particular understanding: I
really don't believe they meant to impose on you, for they
thought so.  As to Bondelmonti, he is much less; he is a low
mimic; the brightest cast of his parts attains to the
composition of a sonnet: he talks irreligion with- English boys,
sentiment with my sister, (218) and bad French with any one that
will hear him.  I will transcribe you a little song that he made
t'other day; 'tis pretty enough; Gray turned it into Latin, and I
into English; you will honour him highly by putting it into
French, and Asheton into Greek.  Here 'tis.
Spesso Amor sotto la forma
D'amista ride, e s'asconde;
Poi si mischia, e si confonde
Con lo sdegno e col rancor.

In pietade ei si trasforma,
Pas trastullo e par dispetto;
ma nel suo diverso aspetto,
Sempre egli `a l'istesso Amor.

Risit amicitiae interd`um velatus amictu,
Et ben`e composit`a veste fefellit Amor:
Mox irae assumpsit cultus faciemque minantem,
Inque odium versus, versus et in lacrymas:
Ludentem fuge, nec lacrymanti aut furenti;
Idem est dissimili semper in ore Deus.

Love often in the comely mien
Of friendship fancies to be seen;
Soon again he shifts his dress,
And wears disdain and rancour's face.

To gentle pity then he changes-
Thro' wantonness, thro' piques he ranges;

But in whatever shape he moves,
He's still himself, and still is Love.

See how we trifle! but one can't pass one's youth too
amusingly for one must grow old, and that in England; two
most serious circumstances, either of which makes people
gray in the twinkling of a bedstaff; for know you there is not a
country upon earth where there are so many old fools and so few
young ones.

Now I proceed in my answers.

I made but small collections, and have only bought some
bronzes and medals, a few busts, and two or three pictures: one
of my busts is to be mentioned; 'tis the famous
vespasian in touchstone, reckoned the best in Rome, except the
Caracalia of the Farnese- I gave but twenty-two POUDds for it at
Cardinal Ottoboni's sale.  One of my medals is as great a
curiosity; 'tis of Alexander Severus, with the
amphitheatre in brass; this reverse is extant on medals of his,
but mine is a medagliuncino, or small medallion, and
The Only one with this reverse known in the world: 'twas
found by a peasant while I was in Rome, and sold by him for
sixpence to an antiquarian, to whom I paid for it seven
guineas and a half: but to virtuosi 'tis worth any SUM.

As to Tartini's (219) musical compositions, ask Gray; I know but
little in music.

But for the Academy, I am not of it, but frequently in
company with it: 'tis all disjointed.  Madame * * *, who,
though a learned lady, has not lost her modesty and
character, is extremely scandalized with the other two
dames, especially Moll Worthless, who knows no bounds.  She is at
rivalry with Lady W. for a certain Mr. * * *, whom
perhaps you knew at Oxford.  If you did not, I'll tell you: he is
a grave young man by temper, and a rich one by
constitution; a shallow creature by nature, but a wit by the
grace of our women here, whom he deals with as of old with the
Oxford toasts.  He fell into sentiments with my Lady W. and was
happy to catch her at Platonic love; but as she
seldom stops there, the poor man will be frightened out of his
senses when she shall break the matter to him; for he
never dreamt that her purposes were so naught.  Lady Mary is so
far gone, that to get him from the mouth of her
antagonist she literally took him out to dance country
dances last night at a formal ball, where there was no
measure kept in laughing at her old, foul, tawdry, painted,
plastered personage.  She played at pharaoh two or three
times at Princess Craon's, where she cheats horse and foot.  She
is really entertaining: I have been reading her works, which she
lends out in manuscript, but they are too
womanish: I like few of her performances.  I forgot to tell you a
good answer of Lady Pomfret to mr. W. *** who asked
her if she did not approve Platonic love. "Lord, sir," says she,
, "I am sure any one that knows me never heard that I had any
love but one, and there sit two proofs of it,"
pointing to her two daughters.

So I have given you a sketch of our employments, and
answered your questions, and will with pleasure as many more as
you have about you.  Adieu! Was ever such a lon@ letter? But 'tis
nothing to what I shall have to say to you.  I
shaft scold you for never telling us any news, public or
private, no deaths, riiarriages, or mishaps; no account of new
books: Oh, you are abominable! I could find it in my
heart to hate You if I did not love you so well; but we will
quarrel now, that we may be the better friends when we meet:
there is no danger of that, is there? Good night, whether
friend or foe! I am most sincerely Yours.

(215) Though brave, skilful, and enterprising Sir John
failed to acquire renown, in consequence of mere
accidents.  On the breaking out of the Spanish war, he was
ordered to cruise in the Bay of Biscay; but, owing to
tempestuous weather, was compelled to put into port for the
winter.  The following lines were addressed to him upon this
occasion:

"Homeward, oh! bend thy course; the seas are rough;
To the Land's End who sails has sailed enough." E.


(216) Walpole calls the Hercules' Pillars an
alehouse.  Whatever it might have been at the period he
wrote, it is very certain that, after the peace of 1762, it was a
respectable tavern, where the Marquis of Granby, and other
persons of rank, particularly military men, had
frequent dinner parties, which were then fashionable.  It
was also an inn of great repute among the west-country
gentlemen, coming to London for a few weeks, who thought
themselves fortunate if they could secure accommodations for
their families at the Hercules' Pillars.  The spot where it once
stood, is now occupied by the noble mansion of the Duke of
Wellington.-E.

story of the "Devil's Sonata," a piece of diablerie, the
result of which is that to this day, Tartini's
tale hath made all fiddlers say, A hard sonata is the devil to
play!-E.



166 Letter 28
To Richard West, Esq.
>From Florence, Nov. 1740.

Child, I am going to let you see your shocking proceedings with
us. On my conscience, I believe 'tis three months since you wrote
to either Gray or me.  If you had been ill, Ashton would have
said so; and if you had been dead the gazettes
would have said it.  If you had been angry,-but that's
impossible; how can one quarrel with folks three thousand
miles off? We are neither divines nor commentators, and
consequently have not hated you on paper.  'Tis to show that my
charity for you cannot be interrupted at this distance
that I write to you, though I have nothing to say, for 'tis a bad
time for small news; and when emperors and czarinas
are dying all up and down Europe, one can't pretend to tell you
of any thing that happens within our sphere.  Not but
that we have our accidents too. if you have had a great wind in
England, we have had a great water at Florence.  We have been
trying to set out every day, and pop upon you (220) * * * * * It
is fortunate that we stayed, for I don't know what had become of
us!  Yesterday, with violent rains, there came flouncing down
from the mountains such a flood that it
floated the whole city. The jewellers on the Old Bridge
removed their commodities, -and in two hours after the
bridge was cracked.  The torrent broke down the quays and
drowned several coach-horses, which are kept here in stables
under ground.  We were moated into our house all day, which is
near the Arno, and had the miserable spectacles of the
ruins that were washed along with the hurricane.  There was a
cart with two oxen not quite dead, and four men in it
drowned: but what was ridiculous, there came tiding along a fat
haycock, with a hen and her eggs, and a cat.  The
torrent is considerably abated; but we expect terrible news from
the country, especially from Pisa, which stands so much lower,
and nearer the sea.  There is a stone here, which,
when the water overflows, Pisa is entirely flooded.  The
water rose two ells yesterday above that stone.  Judge!

For this last month we have passed our time but dully; all
diversions silenced on the emperor's death, (221) and
everybody out of town.  I have seen nothing but cards and
dull pairs of cicisbeos.  I have literally seen so much love and
pharaoh since being here, that I believe I shall never love
either again SO long as I live.  Then I am got in a
horrid lazy way of a morning.  I don't believe I should know
seven o'clock in the morning again if I was to see it.  But I am
returning to England, and shall grow very solemn and
wise! Are you wise'( Dear West, have pity on one who have
done nothing of gravity for these two years, and do laugh
sometimes.  We do nothing else, and have contracted such
formidable ideas of the good people of England that we are
already nourishing great black eyebrows and great black
beards, and teasing our countenances into wrinkles.  Then
for the common talk of the times, we are quite at a loss,
and for the dress.  You would oblige us exceedingly by
forwarding to us the votes of the houses, the king's speech, and
the magazines; or if you had any such thing as a little book
called the Foreigner's Guide through the city of London and the
liberties of Westminster; or a letter to a
Freeholder; or the Political Companion: then 'twoulg be an
infinite obligation if you would neatly band-box up a baby
dressed after the newest Temple fashion now in use at both
play-houses.  Alack-a-day!  We shall just arrive in the
tempest of elections!

As our departure depends entirely upon the weather, we
cannot tell you to a day when we shall say Dear
West, how glad I am to see you! and all the many questions and
answers that we shall give and take.  Would the day were come! Do
but figure to yourself the journey we are to pass through first!
But you can't conceive Alps, Apennines,
Italian inns, and postchaises.  I tremble at the thoughts.  They
were just sufferable while new and unknown, and as we met them by
the way in coming to Florence, Rome, and Naples; but they are
passed, and the mountains remain! Well, write to one in the
interim; direct to me addressed to Monsieur
Selwyn, chez Monsieur.Ilexandre, Rue St. Apolline, a Paris.  If
Mr. Alexandre is not there, the street is, and I believe that
will be sufficient.  Adieu, my dear child! Yours ever.

death, on the 9th of October, his eldest daughter,

168 Letter 29
To The Rev. Joseph Spence. (222)
Florence, Feb. 21, 1741, N. S.

Sir,
Not having time last post, I begged Mr. Mann to thank you for the
obliging paragraph for me in your letter to him.  But as I desire
a nearer correspondence with you than by third hands, I assure
you in my own proper person that I shall have great pleasure, on
our meeting in England, to renew an acquaintance that 'I began
with so much pleasure in Italy. (223)  I Will not reckon you
among my modern friends, but in the first article of virtu: you
have given me so many new lights into a science that but a warmth
and freedom that will flow from my friendship, and which will not
be contained within the circle of a severe awe. As I shall always
be attentive to give you any satisfaction that lies in my power,
I take the first opportunity of sending you two little poems,
both by a hand that I know you esteem the most; if you have not
seen them, you will thank me for lilies of Mr. Pope: if you have,
why I did not know it.

I don't know whether Lord Lincoln has received any orders to
return home: I had a letter from one of my brothers last
post to tell me from Sir Robert that he would have me leave Italy
as soon as possible, lest I should be shut up unawares by the
arrival of the Spanish troops; and that I might pass some time in
France if I had amind.  I own I don't conceive how it is possible
these troops should arrive without its being known some time
before.  And as to the Great Duke's dominions, one can always be
out of them in ten hours or less.  If Lord Lincoln has not
received the same orders.. I shall believe what I now think, that
I am wanted for some other reason.  I beg my kind love to Lord
Lincoln, and that Mr. Spence will believe me, his sincere humble
servant HOR. WALPOLE.

(222) The well-known friend of Pope and author of the
Polymetis, who was then travelling on the Continent with
Henry, Earl of Lincoln, afterwards Duke of Newcastle.  See ante
p. 140, (Letter 14, and footnote 175).-E.

(223) This acquaintance proved of infinite service to
Walpole, shortly after the date of this letter, when he was laid
up with a quinsy at Reggio.  Spence thus describes the
circumstance: "About three or four in the morning I was
surprised with a message, saying that Mr. Walpole was very much
worse, and desired to see me; I went, and found him
scarce able to speak.  I soon learned from his servants that he
had been all the while without a physician, and had
doctored himself; so I immediately sent for the best aid the
place would afford, and despatched a messenger to the
minister at Florence, desiring him to send my friend Dr. Cocchi.
In about twenty-four hours I had the satisfaction to find Mr.
Walpole better: we left him in a fair way of recovery, and we
hope to see him next week at Venice.  I had obtained leave of
Lord Lincoln to stay behind some days if he had been worse.  You
see what luck one has sometimes in going out of one's way.  If
Lord Lincoln had not wandered to
Reggio, Mr. Walpole (who is one of the best-natured and most
sensible young gentlemen England affords) would have, in all
probability, fallen a sacrifice to his disorder."-E.



169 Letter 30
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Florence, March 25th, 1741, N. S.

Dear Hal,
You must judge by what you feel yourself of what I feel for
Selwyn's recovery, with the addition of what I have suffered from
post to post.  But as I find the whole town have had the same
sentiments about him, (though I am sure few so strong as myself,)
I will not repeat what you have heard so much.  I shall write to
him to-night, though he knows without my
telling him how very much I love him.  To you, my dear Harry, I
am infinitely obliged for the three successive letters you wrote
me about him, which gave me double pleasure, as they showed your
attention for me at a time that you know I must be so unhappy;
and your friendship for him.  Your account of Sir Robert's
victory (224) was so extremely well told, that I made Gray
translate it into French, and have showed it to all that could
taste It, or were inquisitive on the occasion.  I have received a
print by this post that diverts me extremely; 'the Motion.' (225)
Tell me, dear, now, who made the design, and who took the
likenesses; they are admirable: the lines are as good as one sees
on such occasions.  I wrote last post to Sir Robert, to wish him
joy; I hope he received my letter.

I was to have set out last Tuesday, but on Sunday came the news
of the Queen of Hungary being brought to bed of a son; (226) on
which occasion here will be great triumphs, operas and
masquerades, which detain me for a short time.

I won't make you any excuse for sending you the follOWing
lines; you have prejudice enough for me to read with patience any
Of My idlenesses. (227)

My dear Harry, you enrage me with talking of another journey to
Ireland; it will shock me if I don't find you at my return: pray
take care and be in England.

I wait with some patience to see Dr. Middleton's Tully, as I read
the greatest part of it in manuscript; though indeed 'tis rather
a reason for my being impatient to read the rest.  If Tully can
receive any additional honour, Dr. Middleton is most capable of
conferring it. (228)

I receivc with great pleasure any remembrances of my lord and
your sisters; I long to see all of you.  Patapan is so
handsome that he has been named the silver fleece; and there is a
new order of knighthood to be erected to his honour, in
opposition to the golden.  Precedents are searching, and plans
drawing up for that purpose.  I hear that the natives pretend to
be companions, upon the authority of their dogskin
waistcoats; but a council that has been held on purpose has
declared their pretensions impertinent.  Patapan has lately taken
wife unto him, as ugly as he is genteel, but of a very great
family, being the direct heiress of Canis Scaliger, Lord of
Verona: which principality we design to seize `a la
Prussienne; that is, as soon as ever we shall have persuaded the
republic of Venice that we are the best friends they have in the
world.  Adieu, dear child!
Yours ever.

P. S. I left my subscriptions for Middleton's Tully with Mr.
Selwyn; I won't trouble him, but I wish you would take care and
get the books, if Mr. S. has kept the list.

(224) On the event of Mr. Sandys' motion in the House of
commons to remove Sir Robert Walpole from the King's presence and
councils for ever. [The motion was negatived by 290
against 106: an unusual majority, which proceeded from the schism
between the Tories and the Whigs, and the secession of Shippen
and his friends.  The same motion was made by
Lord-Carteret in the House of Lords, and negatived by 108
against 59.-E.)

(225) The print alluded to exhibits an interesting view of
Whitehall, the Treasury, and adjoining buildings, as they
stood at the time.  The Earl of Chesterfield, as postilion of a
coach which is going full speed towards the Treasury, drives over
all in his way.  The Duke of Argyle is coachman,
flourishing a sword instead of a whip; while Doddington is
represented as a spaniel, sitting between his legs.  Lord
Carteret, perceiving the coach about to be overturned, is
calling to the coachman,"Let me get out!"  Lord Cobbam, as the
footman, is holding fast on by the straps; while Lord
Lyttleton is ambling by the side on a rosinante as thin as
himself. Smallbrook, Bishop of Lichfield, is bowing
obsequiously as they pass; while Sandys, letting fall the
place-bill, exclaims, ,I thought what would come of putting him
on the box." In the foreground is Pulteney, leading
several figures by strings from their noses, and wheeling a
barrow filled with the Craftsman's Letters, Champion, State of
the Nation, and Common Sense, exclaiming, "Zounds, they are
over!"  This caricature, and another, entitled " The Political
Libertines, or Motion upon Motion," had been provoked by one put
forth by Sir Robert Walpole's opponents, entitled "The Grounds
for the Motion;" and were followed up by another from the
supporters of Sandys' motion, entitled "The Motive or
Reason for his Triumph," which the caricaturist attributes
entirely to bribery.-E.

(226) Afterwards Joseph the Second, emperor of Germany.-E.

(227) Here follows the Inscription for the neglected column in
the place of St. Mark, at Florence, afterwards printed in the
Fugitive Pieces.

(228) Dr. Middleton's "History of the Life of Cicero" was
published in the early part of this year, by subscription, and
dedicated to Pope's enemy, Lord Hervey.  This laboured
encomium on his lordship obtained for the doctor a niche in the
Dunciad:-

Narcissus, praised with all a Parson's power,
Look'd a white lily sunk beneath a shower."-E.



170 Letter 31
To Richard West, Esq.
Reggio, May 1 1741, N. S.

Dear West,
I have received the end of your first act, (229) and now will
tell you sincerely what I think of it.  If I was not so
pleased with the beginning as I usually am with your
compositions, believe me the part of Pausanias has charmed me.
There is all imaginable art joined with all requisite
simplicity: and a simplicity, I think, much preferable to that in
the scenes of Cleodora and Argilius.  Forgive me, if I say they
do not talk laconic but low English in her, who is
Persian too, there would admit more heroic.  But for the whole
part of Pausanias, 'tis great and well worried up, and the art
that is seen seems to proceed from his head, not from the
author's.  As I am very desirous you should continue, so I own I
wish you would improve or change the beginning: those who know
you not so well as I do, would not wait with so much
patience for the entrance of Pausanias.  You see I am frank; and
if I tell you I do not approve of the first part, you may believe
me as sincere when I tell you I admire the latter
extremely.

My letter has an odd date.  You would not expect I should be
writing in such a dirty place as Reggio: but the fair is
charming; and here come all the nobility of Lombardy, and all the
broken dialects of Genoa, Milan, Venice, Bologna, etc.  You never
heard such a ridiculous confusion of tongues.  All the morning
one goes to the fair undressed, as to the walks of Tunbridge:
'tis Just in that manner, with lotteries, raffles, etc.  After
dinner all the company return in their coaches, and make a kind
of corso, with the ducal family, who go to shops, where you talk
to 'em, from thence to the opera, in mask if you will, and
afterwards to the ridotto.  This five nights in the week, Fridays
there are masquerades, and
Tuesdays balls at the Rivalta, a villa of the Duke's.  In
short, one diverts oneself.  I pass most part of the opera in the
Duchess's box, who is extremely civil to me and extremely
agreeable.  A daughter of the Regent's, (230) that could
please him, must be so.  She is not young, though still
handsome, but fat; but has given up her gallantries
cheerfully, and in time, and lives easily with a dull husband,
two dull sisters of his, and a dull court.  These two
princesses are wofully ugly, old maids and rich.  They might have
been married often; but the old Duke was whimsical and proud, and
never would consent to any match for them, but left them much
money, and pensions of three thousand pounds a year apiece.
There was a design to have given the eldest to this King of
Spain, and the Duke was to have had the Parmesan
princess; so that now he would have had Parma and Placentia,
Joined to Modena, Reggio, Mirandola, and Massa.  But there being
a Prince of Asturias, the old Duke Rinaldo broke off the match,
and said his daughter's children should not be younger brothers:
and so they mope old virgins.

I am goin@ from hence to Venice, in a fright
lest there be a war with France, and then I must drag myself
through Germany.  We have had an imperfect account of a
sea-fight in America . but we are so out of the way, that one
can't be sure of it.  Which way soever I return, I shall be soon
in England, and there you 'will find me again.

As much as ever yours.

(229) of a tragedy called Pausanias, The first act, and
probably all that was ever written by Mr. West. [In the
preceding month West had forwarded to Gray the sketch of this
tragedy, which he appears to have criticised with
much freedom; but Mr. Mason did not find among Gray's papers
either the sketch itself, or the free critique upon it.]

172 Letter 32
To Sir Horace Mann. (231)
Calais, and Friday, and here I have been these two days, 1741.

Is the wind laid? Shall I Dever get aboard? I came here on
Wednesday night, but found a tempest that has never ceased since.
At Boulogne I left Lord Shrewsbury and his mother, and brothers
and sisters, waiting too: Bulstrode (232) passes his winter at
the court of Boulogne, and then is to travel with two young
Shrewsburys.  I was overtaken by Amorevoli and Monticelli, (233)
who are here with me and the Viscontina, and Barberina, and
Abbate Vanneschi (234)-what
a coxcomb!  I would have talked to him about the opera, but he
preferred politics.  I have wearied Amorevoli with
questions about you.  If he was not just come from you, and could
talk to me about you, I should hate him; for, to
flatter me, he told me that I talked Italian better than
you.  He did not know how little I think it a compliment to have
any thing preferred to you-besides, you know the
consistence of my Italian!  They are all frightened out of their
senses about going on the sea, and are not a little
afraid of the English.  They went on board the William and Mary
yacht yesterday, which waits here for Lady Cardigan from Spa.
The captain clapped the door, and swore in broad English that the
Viscontina should not stir till she gave him a song, he did not
care whether it was a catch or a moving ballad; but she would not
submit.  I wonder he did!  When she came home and told me, I
begged her not to judge of all the English from this specimen;
but, by the way, she will find many
sea-captains that grow on dry land.

Sittinburn, Sept. 13, O. S.

Saturday morning, or yesterday, we did set out, and after a good
passage of four hours and a half, landed at Dover.  I begin to
count my comforts, for I find their contraries
thicken on my apprehension.  I have, at least, done for a
while with postchaises.  My trunks were a little opened at
Calais, and they would have stopped my medals, but with much ado
and much three louis's they let them pass.  At Dover I found the
benefit of the motions (235) having miscarried last year, for
they respected Sir Robert's son even in the person of his trunks.
I came over in a yacht with East India
captains' widows, a Catholic girl, coming from a convent to be
married, with an Irish priest to guard her, who says he
studied medicines for two years, and after that he studied
learning for two years more.  I have not brought over a word of
French or Italian for common use; I have so taken pains to avoid
affectation in this point, that I have failed Only now and then
in a chi`a l`a! to the servants, who I
can scarce persuade myself yet are English.  The
COUntry-town (and you will believe me, who, you know, am not
prejudiced) delights me; the populousness, the ease, the
gaiety, and well-dressed every body amaze me.  Canterbury, which
on my setting out I thought deplorable, is a paradise, (236) to
Modena, Reggio, Parma, etc.  I had before discovered that there
was nowhere but in England the distinction of
middling people; I perceive now, that there is peculiar to us
middling houses: how snug they are!  I write to-night
because I have time; to-morrow I get to London just as the post
goes.  Sir Robert is at Houghton.  Good night till
another post.  You are quite well I
trust, but tell me so always.  My loves to the Chutes (237)  and
all the etc.'s.

Oh! a story of Mr. Pope and the prince:-"Mr. Pope, you don't love
princes."  "Sir, I beg your pardon."  "Well, you don't love
kings, then!""Sir, I own I love the lion best
before his claws are grown."  Was it possible to make a
better answer to such simple questions?  Adieu! my dearest child!
Yours, ten thousand times over.

P. S. Patapan does not seem to regret his own country.

(231) This is the first of the series of letters
addressed by Walpole to Sir Horace Man, British envoy at
the court of Tuscany.  The following prefatory note,
entitled "Advertisement by the Author," explains the views which
led Walpole to preserve them for publication:-

"The following Collection of Letters, written
very carelessly by a young man, had been preserved by the
person to whom they were addressed.  The author, some years after
the date of the first, borrowed them, on account of
some anecdotes interspersed.  On the perusal, among many
trifling relations and stories, which were only of
consequence or amusing to the two persons concerned in the
correspondence, he found some facts, characters, and news, which,
though below the dignity of history, might prove
entertaining to many other people: and knoing how much
pleasure, not only himself, but many other persons have
found in a series of private and familiar letters, he
thought it worth his while to preserve these, as they
contain something of the customs, fashions, politics,
diversions, and private history of several
years; which, if worthy of any existence, can be properly
transmitted to posterity only in this manner.

"The reader will find a few pieces of intelligence which did not
prove true; but which are retained here as the author
heard and related them, lest correction should spoil the
simple air of the narrative.* When the letters
were written, they were never intended for public
inspection; and now they are far from being thought correct,  or
more authentic than the general turn of epistolary
correspondence admits.  The author would sooner have burnt them
than have taken the trouble to correct such errant
trifles, which are here presented to the reader, with scarce any
variation or omissions, but what private friendships and private
history, or the great haste with which the letters were written,
made indispensably necessary, as will plainly appear, not only by
the unavoidable chasms, where the
originals were worn out or torn away,
but by many idle relations and injudicious remarks and
prejudices of a young man; for which @the only excuse the
author can pretend to make, is, that as some future reader may
possibly be as young as he was when he first wrote, he hopes they
may be amused with what graver people (if into such hands they
should fall) will very justly despise.  Who ever has patience to
peruse the series, will find, perhaps, that as the author grew
older, some of his faults became less striking."
* They are marked in the notes.

(232) Tutor to the young Earl of Shrewsbury.  [.Charles
Talbot, fifteenth Earl of Shrewsbury, born December 1719.  He
married, in 1753, Elizabeth, daughter of the Hon.  John Dormer,
afterwards Lord Dormer, and died in
1787, without issue.]

(233) Italian singers.  [Angelo Maria Monticelli, a celebrated
singer of the same class as Veluti, was born at Milan in 1715,
and first attained the celebrity which he enjoyed by singing with
Mingotti at the Royal Opera at Naples in 1746.  After visiting
most of the cities of the Continent, he was induced by the favour
with which he was received at Dresden to make that city his
residence, until his death in 1764.  Is the name of Amorevoli,
borne by one of the first singers of that
day, an assumed one, or an instance of name fatality?
Certain it is,that Amorevole is a technical term in music
somewhat analogous in its signification with Amabile and
Amoroso.]

(234) An Italian abb`e, who directed and wrote the
operas under the protection of Lord Middlesex.

To Sir Horace Mann.
[The beginning of this letter is lost.)

****I had written and sealed my letter, but have since
received another from you, dated Sept. 24. I read Sir Robert your
account of Corsica; he seems to like hearing any account sent
this way-indeed, they seem to have more superficial
relations in general than I could have believed! You will
oblige me, too, with any farther account of Bianca Colonna: (238)
it is romantic, her history!

I am infinitely obliged to Mr. Chute for his kindness to me, and
still more for his friendship to you.  You cannot think how happy
I am to hear that you are to keep him longer.  You do not mention
his having received my letter from Paris: I directed it to him,
recommended to you.  I would not have him think me capable of
neglecting to answer his letter, which obliged me so much.  I
will deliver Amorevoli his letter the first time I see him.

Lord Islay (239) dined here; I mentioned Stosch's (240)
Maltese cats.  Lord Islay begged I would write to Florence to
have the largest male and female that can be got.  If you will
speak to Stosch, you will oblige me: they may come by sea.
You cannot imagine my amazement at your not being
invited to Riccardi's ball; do tell me, when you know, what can
be the meaning of it; it could not be inadvertence-nay, that were
as bad! Adieu my dear child, once more!

Rome, though it was suspected that he was a spy on both sides: he
was a man of a most infamous character in every
respect.  according to the Biographic Universelle, the Baron "ne
put s'acquitter de fonctions aussi d`elicates sans se voir
expos`e `a des naines violentes, qui le forc`erent `a se
retirer `a Florence;" where he died in 1757.  He was one of the
most skilful and industrious antiquaries of his time.  A
catalogue of his gems was drawn up by Winkelmann.]



175 Letter 34
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
London, 1741.

My Dearest Harry,
Before I thank you for myself, I must thank you for that
excessive good nature you showed in writing to poor Gray. I am
less impatient to see you, as I find you are not the least
altered, but have the same tender friendly temper you always had.
I wanted much to see if you were still the same-but you are.

Don't think of coming before your brother, he is too good to be
left for any one living: besides, if it is possible, I will see
you in the country.  Don't reproach me, and think nothing could
draw me into the country: impatience to see a few
friends has drawn me out of Italy; and Italy, Harry, is
pleasanter than London.  As I do not love living en famille so
much as you (but then indeed my family is not like yours), I am
hurried about getting myself a house; for I have so long lived
single, that I do not much take to being confined with my own
family.

You won't find me much altered, I believe; at least,
outwardly.  'I am not grown a bit shorter, or a bit fatter, but
am just the same long lean creature as usual.  Then I talk no
French., but to my footman; nor Italian, but to myself.  What
inward alterations may have happened to me, you will
discover best; for you know 'tis said, one never knows that one's
self.  I will answer, that that part of it that belongs to you,
has not suffered the least change-I took care of that.
For virt`u, I have a little to entertain you: it is my sole
pleasure.-I am neither young enough nor old enough to be in love.

My dear Harry, will you take care and make my compliments to that
charming Lady Conway, (241) who I hear is so charming, and to
Miss Jenny [Conway], who I know is so?  As for Miss Anne, (242)
and her love as far as it is decent: tell her, decency is out of
the question between us, that I love her without any restriction.
I settled it yesterday with Miss Conway, that you three are
brothers and sister to me, and that if you had been so, I could
not love you better.  I have so many cousins, and uncles and
aunts, and bloods that grow in Norfolk, that if I had portioned
out my affections to them, as they say I should, what a modicum
would have fallen to
each!-So, to avoid fractions, I love my family in you three,
their representatives. (243)

Adieu, my dear Harry! Direct to me at Downing Street.
Good-bye!  Yours ever.

(241) Isabella Fitzroy, daughter of Charles Duke of
Grafton.  She had been married in May, to(Walpole's maternal
cousin), Francis Seymour Conway, afterwards Earl of Hertford.(

242) Miss Anne conway, youngest sister of Henry Seymour
Conway.

(243) They were first cousins by the mother's side; Francis first
Lord conway having married Charlotte, eldest daughter of John
Shorter of Bybrook in Kent, sister to Catherine Shorter Lady
Walpole.



176 Letter 35
To Sir Horace Mann.
Downing Street, Oct. 8, 1741, O. S.

I have been very near sealing this letter with black wax; Sir
Robert came from Richmond on Sunday night extremely ill, and on
Monday was in great danger.  It was an ague and looseness; but
they have stopped the latter, and converted the other into a
fever, which they are curing with the bark.  He came out of his
chamber to-day for the first time, and is quite out of danger.
One of the newspapers says, Sir R. W. is so bad that there are no
Hopes of him.

The Pomfrets (244) are arrived; I went this morning to visit my
lord, but did not find him.  Lady Sophia is ill, and my earl
(245) still at Paris, not coming. There is no news, nor a soul in
town.  One talks of nothing but distempers, like Sir Robert's.
My Lady Townsende (246) was reckoning up the other day the
several things that have cured them; such a doctor so many, such
a medicine, so many; but of all, the greatest
number have found relief from the sudden deaths of their
husbands.

The opera begins the day after the King's birthday: the
singers are not permitted to sing till on the stage, so no one
has heard them, nor have I seen Amorovoli to give him the
letter.  The opera is to be on the French system of dancers,
scenes, and dresses.  The directors have already laid out
great sums.  They talk of a mob to silence the operas, as they
did the French players; but it will be more difficult, for here
half the young noblemen in town are engaged, and they will not be
so easily persuaded to humour the taste of the mobility: in
short, they have already retained several eminent lawyers from
the Bear Garden (247) to plead their defence.  I have had a long
visit this morning from Don Benjamin: (248) he is one of the best
kind of agreeable men I ever saw-quite fat and easy, with
universal knowledge: he is in the greatest
esteem at my court.

I am going to trouble you with some commissions.  Miss Rich,
(249) who is the finest singer except your sister (250) in the
world, has begged me to get her some music, particularly "the
office of the Virgin of the Seven Sorrows," by Pergolesi,
(251) the "Serva Padrona, il Pastor se torna Aprile," and
"Symplicetta Pastorella."  If you can send these easily, you will
much oblige me.  Do, too, let me know by your brother, what you
have already laid out for me, that I may pay him.
I was mentioning to Sir Robert some pictures in italy, which I
wished him to buy; two particularly, if they can be got, would
make him delight in you beyond measure.  They are, a Madonna, and
Child, by Dominichino, (252) in the palace Zambeccari, at
Boloana, or Caliambec, (253) as they call it; Mr. Chute knows the
picture.  The other is by Corregio, in a convent at Parma, and
reckoned the second best of that hand in the world.  There are
the Madonna and Child, St. Catherine, St. Matthew, and other
figures: it is a most known picture, and has been
engraved by Augustin Caracei.  If you can employ any body
privately to inquire about these pictures, be so good as to let
me know; Sir R. would not scruple almost any price, for he has of
neither hand: the convent is poor: the Zambeccari
collection is to be sold, though, when I inquired after this
picture, they would not set a price.

Lord Euston is to be married to Lady Dorothy Boyle (254)
tomorrow, after so many delays.  I have received your long
letter, and Mr. Chute's too, which I will answer next post.  I
wish I had the least politics to tell you; but all is silent.
The opposition sav not a syllable, because they don't know what
the Court will think of public 'affairs; and they will not take
their part till they are sure of contradicting.  The Court will
not be very ready to declare themselves, as their present
situation is every way disagreeable.  All they say, is to throw
the blame entirely on the obstinacy of the Austrian Court, who
-,vould never stir or soften for themselves, while they thought
any one obliged to defend them.  All I know of news is, that
Poland is leaning towards the acquisition side, like her
neighbours, and proposes to get a lock of the Golden Fleece too.
Is this any part of Gregory's (255) negotiation?  I delight in
his Scapatta--"Scappata, no; egli solamente ha preso la posta."
My service to Seriston; he is charming.

How excessively obliging to go to Madame Grifoni's (256)
festino!  but believe me, I shall be angry, if for my sake, you
do things that are out of your character: don't you know that I
am infinitely fonder of that than of her?

I read your story of the Sposa Panciatici at table, to the great
entertainment of the company, and Prince Craon's
epitaph, which Lord Cholmley (257) says he has heard before, and
does not think it is the prince's own; no more do I, it is too
good; but make my compliments of thanks to him; he shall have his
buckles the first opportunity I find of sending them.
Say a thousand things for me to dear Mr. Chute, till I can say
them next post for myself: till then, adieu.  Yours ever.

(244) Thomas Earl of Pomfret, and Henrietta Louisa, his
consort, and his two eldest daughters, Sophia and Charlotte, had
been in Italy at the same time with Mr. Walpole.  The Earl had
been master of the horse to Queen Caroline, and the
countess lady of the bedchamber.

(245) Henry Earl of Lincoln was at that time in love with Lady
Sophia Fermor.

(246) Ethelreda Harrison, wife of Charles Lord Viscount
Townsend, but parted from him.

(247) Boxers.

(248) Sir Benjamin Keene, ambassador at Madrid.

(249) Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Sir Robert Rich, since
married to Sir George Lyttelton.  [Eldest son of sir Thomas
Lyttelton of hagley; in 1744 appointed one of the lords of the
treasury, and in 1755, chancellor of the exchequer.  In
1757,when he retired from public life, he was raised to the
peerage, by the title of Lord Lyttelton.  He died in 1773.  His
prose works were printed collectively in 1774; and his poems have
given him a place among the British poets.]

(250) Mary, daughter of R. Mann, Esq. since married to Mr. Foote.

(251) Better known to all lovers of the works of this great
composer as his " Stabat mater."-E.

(252) It will be seen by Walpole's letter to Mr. Chute, of the
20th August 1743, now first published, that he eventually
succeeded in purchasing this picture.-E.

(253) A corrupted pronunciation of the Bolognese.

(254) This unfortunate marriage is alluded to several times in
the course of the subsequent letters.  George Earl of Euston was
the eldest son of Charles the second Duke of Grafton.  He
married, in 1741, Lady Dorothy Boyle, eldest daughter and
co-heir of Richard, third and last heir of B(irlington.  She died
in 1742, from the effects, as it is supposed, of his
brutal treatment of her.  The details of his cruelty towards her
are almost too revolting to be believed.  In Sir Charles Hanbury
Williams's poems are some pretty lines on her death, beginning,
"Behold one moment Dorothea's fate."-D.

(255) Gregorio ALdollo, an Asiatic, from being a prisoner at
Leghorn, raised himself to be employed to the Great Duke by the
King of Poland.

(256) Elisabetta Capponi, wife of signor
Grifoni, a great beauty.

(257) George third Earl of Cholmondeley, had married Mary
Walpole, only legitimate daughter of Sir Robert Walpole-D.

London, Oct. 13, 1741.
[The greatest part of this letter is wanting.]

**** The Town will come to town, and then one shall know
something.  Sir Robert is quite recovered.

Lady Pomfret I saw last night: Lady Sophia has been ill with a
cold; her head is to be dressed French, and her body English, for
which I am sorry; her figure is so fine in a robe: she is full as
sorry as I am.  Their trunks are not arrived yet, so they have
not made their appearance.  My lady told me a little out of
humour that Uguecioni wrote her word, that you said her things
could not be sent away yet: I understood from you, that very
wisely, you would have nothing to do about them, so made no
answer.

The parliament meets the fifteenth of November.  ****
Amorevoli has been with me two hours this evening; he is in
panics about the first night, which is the next after the
birthday.

I have taken a master, not to forget my Italian-don't it look
like returning to Florence'!-some time or other.  Good night.
Yours
ever and ever, my dear child.



178 Letter 37
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, Oct. 19, 1741, O. S.
[Great part wanting.]

I write to you up to the head and ears in dirt, straw, and
unpacking.  I have been opening all my cases from the
Custom-house the whole morning; and-are not you glad?-every
individual safe and undamaged.  I am fitting up an apartment in
Downing Street ***(258) was called in the morning, and was asleep
as soon as his head touched the pillow, for I have
frequently known him snore ere they had drawn his curtains, now
never sleeps above an hour without waking; and he, who at dinner
always forgot he was minister, and was more gay and thoughtless
than all his company, now sits without speaking, and with his
eyes fixed for an hour together.  Judge if this is the Sir Robert
you knew.

The politics of the age are entirely suspended; nothing is
mentioned; but this bottling them up, will make them fly out with
the greater violence the moment the parliament meets; till *** a
word to you about this affair.

I am sorry to hear the Venetian journey of the Suares family; it
does not look as if the Teresina was to marry PandOlfini; do you
know, I have set my heart upon that match.

You are very good to the Pucci, to give her that advice,
though I don't suppose she will follow it.  The Bolognese
scheme ***  In return for Amorevoli's letter, he has given me
two.  I fancy it will be troublesome to you; so put his wife into
some other method of correspondence with him.

Do you love puns? A pretty man of the age came into the
playhouse the other night, booted and spurred: says he, "I am
come to see Orpheus"-"And Euridice- You rid I see," replied
another gentleman.

(258) The omissions in these letters marked with stars occur in
the original MS.-D.



179 Letter 38
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, Oct. 22, 1741, O. S.

Your brother has been with me this morning, and we have talked
over your whole affair.  He thinks it will be impossible to find
any servant of the capacities you require, that will live with
you under twenty, if not thirty pounds a-year, especially as he
is not to have your clothes: then the expense of the journey to
Florence, and of back again, in case you should not like him,
will be considerable.  He is for your taking one from Leghorn;
but I, who know a little more of Leghorn than he does, should be
apprehensive of any person from thence being in the interest of
Goldsworthy, (259) or too attached to the merchants: in short, I
mean, he would be liable to prove a spy upon you.  We have agreed
that I shall endeavour to find out a proper man, if such a one
will go to you for twenty pounds a-year, and then you shall ficar
from me.  I am very sensible that Palombo (260) is not fit for
you, and shall be extremely diligent in equipping you with such a
one as you want.  You know how much I want to be of service to
you even in trifles.
I have been much diverted privately, for it is a secret that not
a hundred persons know yet, and is not to be spoken of.  Do but
think on a duel between Winnington (261) and Augustus Townshend;
(262) the latter a pert boy, captain of an
Indiaman; the former declared cicisbeo to my Lady Townshend.  The
quarrel was something that Augustus had said of them; for since
she was parted from her husband, she has broke with all his
family.  Winnington challenged; they walked into Hyde Park last
Sunday morning, scratched one another's fingers, tumbled into two
ditches-that is Augustus did,-kissed, and walked home together.
The other night at Mrs. Boothby's-

Well, I did believe I should never find time to write to you
again; I was interrupted in my letter last post, and could not
finish it; to-day I came home from the King's levee, where I
Kissed his hand, without going to the drawing-room, on purpose to
finish my letter, and the moment I sat down they let
somebody in.  That somebody is gone, and I go on-At Mrs.
Boothby's Lady Townshend was coquetting with Lord Baltimore:
(263) he told her, if she meant any thing with him he was not for
her purpose; if only to make any one jealous, he would throw away
an hour with her with all his heart.

The whole town is to be to-morrow night at Sir Thomas
Robinson's (264) ball, which he gives to a little girl of the
Duke of Richmond's.  There are already two hundred invited, from
miss in bib and apron, to my lord chancellor (265) in bib and
mace.  You shall hear about it next post.

I wrote you word that Lord Euston is married: in a week more I
believe that I shall write you word that he is divorced.  He is
brutal enough; and has forbid Lady Burlington (266) his house,
and that in very ungentle terms.  The whole family is in
confusion: the Duke of Grafton half dead. and Lord
Burlington half mad.  The latter has challenged Lord Euston, who
accepted the challenge, but they were prevented.  There are
different stories: some say that the duel would have been no
breach of consanguinity; others, that there's a contract of
marriage come out in another place, which has had more
consanguinity than ceremony in it: in short, one cannot go into a
room but you hear something of it.  Do you not pity the poor
girl? of the softest temper, vast beauty, birth, and
fortune, to be so sacrificed!

The letters from the West Indies are not the most agreeable.  You
have heard of the fine river and little town which Vernon took,
and named, the former dugusta, the latter Cumberland.  Since
that, they have found out that it is impracticable to take St.
Jago by sea - on which Admiral Vernon and Ogle
insisted that Wentworth, with the land forces, should march to it
by land, which he, by advice of all the land-officers, has
refused; for their march would have been of eighty miles, through
a mountainous, unknown country, full of defiles, where not two
men could march abreast; and they have but four
thousand five hundred men, and twenty-four horses.  Quires of
paper from both sides are come over to the council, who are to
determine from hence what is to be done.  They have taken a
Spanish man-of-war and a register ship, going to Spain,
immensely valuable.

The parliament does not meet till the first of December, which
relieves me into a little happiness, and gives me a little time
to settle myself.  I have unpacked all my things, and have not
had the least thing suffer.  I am now only in a
fright about my birthday clothes, which I bespoke at Paris:
Friday is the day, and this is Monday, without any news of them!

I have been two or three times at the play, very unwillingly; for
nothing was ever so bad as the actors, except the company.  There
is much in vogue a Mrs. Woffington, (267) a bad actress; but she
has life.

Lord Hartington (268) dines here: it is said (and from his
father's partiality to another person's father, I don't think it
impossible) that he is to marry a certain miss:(269) Lord
Fitzwilliam is supposed another candidate.

Here is a new thing which has been much about town, and liked;
your brother Gale (270) gave me the copy of it:

                          "Les cours de l'Europe

L'Allemagne craint tout;
L'Autriche risque tout;
La Bavi`ere esp`ere touut;
La Prusse entreprend tout;

Le Mercure se m`ele de tout;
La France sch`ete tout;
Les Jesuites se trouvent par tout;
Rome b`enit tout'
Si dieu ne pourvoye `a tout,
Le diable emportera tout."

Good night, my dear child: you never say a word of your own
health; are not you quite recovered? a thousand services to Mr.
Chute and Mr. Whithed, and to all my friends: do they
begin to forget me? I don't them.  Yours, ever.

(259) Consul at Leghorn, who was endeavouring to supplant Mr.
Mann.

(260)An Italian, secretary to Mr. Mann.

(261"Winnington," says Walpole, (Memoirs, i. P. 151), "had been
bred a Tory, but had left them in the height of Sir
Robert Walpole's power -.  when that minister sunk.  he had
injudiciously, and, to please my Lady Townshend, who had then the
greatest influence over him, declined visiting him, in a manner
to offend the steady old Whigs; and his jolly way of laughing.at
his own want of principles had revolted all the graver sort, who
thought deficiency of honesty too sacred and profitable a
commodity to be profaned and turned into
ridicule.  He had infinitely more wit than any man I ever
knew, and it was as ready and quick as it was constant and
Unmeditated.  His style was a little brutal, his courage not at
all so; his good-humour inexhaustible; it was impossible to hate
or to trust him." Winnington was first Ynade lord of the
admiralty, then of the treasury, then cofferer, and lastly
paymaster of the forces: to which office, on his death in
1746, Mr. Pitt succeeded.-E.

(262) The Hon. Augustus Townshend was second son of the

in order to distinguish him from the diplomatist, Sir
Thomas Robinson, afterwards created Lord Grantham. [He has
elsewhere been styled the new Robinson Crusoe by Walpole, who
says, when speaking of him, " He was a tall, uncouth man; and his
stature was often rendered still more remarkable by his
hunting-dress, a postilion's cap, a tight green jacket, and
buckskin breeches.  He was liable to sudden whims, and once set
off on a sudden in his hunting suit to visit his sister, who was
married and settled at Paris.  He arrived while there was a large
company at dinner.  The servant announced M.
Robinson, and he came in to the great amazement of the hosts.
Among others, -a French abb`e thrice lifted his fork to his mouth
and thrice laid it down, with an eager stare of
surprise.  Unable to restrain his curiosity any longer, he burst
out with I Excuse me, sir, are you the famous Robinson Crusoe so
remarkable in history?'"]

182 Letter 39
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, Nov. 2, 1741.

You shall not hear a word but of balls and public places: this
one week has seen Sir T. Robinson's ball, my lord mayor's, the
birthday, and the opera.  There were an hundred and
ninety-seven persons at Sir Thomas's, and yet was it so well
conducted that nobody felt a crowd.  He had taken off all his
doors, and so separated the old and the young, that neither were
inconvenienced with the other.  The ball began at eight; each man
danced one minuet with his partner, and then began country
dances.  There were four-and-twenty couple, divided into twelve
a@d twelve: each set danced two dances, and then retired into
another room, while the other set took their two; and so
alternately.  Except Lady Ancram, (271) no married
woman danced; so you see, in England, we do not foot it till
five-and-fifty.  The beauties were the Duke of Richmond's two
daughters (272) and their mother, still handsomer than they: the
duke (273) sat by his wife all night, kissing her hand: how this
must sound in the ears of Florentine cicisbeos, cock or hen! Then
there was Lady Euston, Lady Caroline Fitzroy, (274) Lady Lucy
Manners, (275) Lady Camilla Bennett, (276) and Lady Sophia, (277)
handsomer than all, but a little out of humour at the scarcity of
minuets; however, as usual, she
danced more than any body, and, as usual too, took out what men
she liked or thought the best dancers. Lord Holderness (278) is a
little what Lord Lincoln (279) will be to-morrow; for he is
expected.  There was Churchill's daughter (280) who is prettyish,
and dances well; and the Parsons (281) family from Paris, who are
admired too; but indeed it is `a force des muscles.  Two other
pretty women were Mrs. Colebroke (did you know the he-Colebroke
in Italy?) and a Lady Schaub, a
foreigner, who, as Sir Luke says, would have him.  Sir R. was
afraid of the heat, and did not go.  The supper was served at
twelve; a large table of hot for the lady-dancers; their
partners and other tables stood round.  We danced (for I
country-danced) till four, then had tea and coffee, and came
home.-Finis Balli.

* * Friday was the birthday; it was vastly full, the ball
immoderately so, for there came all the second edition of my lord
mayor's, but not much finery: Lord Fitzwilliam (282) and myself
were far the most superb.  I did not get mine till nine that
morning.

The opera will not tell as well as the other two shows, for they
were obliged to omit the part of Amorevoli, who has a fever.  The
audience was excessive, without the least
disturbance, and almost as little applause; I cannot conceive
why, for Monticelli ***** be able to sing to-morrow.

At court I met the Shadwells; (283) Mademoiselle Misse Molli,
etc.  I love them, for they asked vastly after you, and
kindly.  Do you know, I have had a mind to visit Pucci, the
Florentine minister, but he is so black, and looks so like a
murderer in a play, that I have never brought it about yet?  I
know none of the foreign ministers, but Ossorio, (284) a
little; he is still vastly in fashion, though extremely
altered.  Scandal, who, I believe, is not mistaken, lays a Miss
Macartney to his charge; she is a companion to the
Duchess of Richmond, as Madame Goldsworthy was; but Ossorio will
rather be Wachtendonck (285) than Goldsworthy: what a lamentable
story is that of the hundred sequins per month!  I have mentioned
Mr. Jackson, as you desired, to Sir R., who says, he has a very
good opinion of him.  In case of any
change at Leghorn, you will let me know.  He will not lose his
patron, Lord Hervey, (286) so soon as I imagined; he begins to
recover.

I believe the Euston embroil is adjusted; I was with Lady
Caroline Fitzroy on Friday evening; there were her brother and
the bride, and quite bridal together, quite honeymoonish.

I forgot to tell you that the prince was not at the opera; I
believe it has been settled that he should go thither on
Tuesdays, and Majesty on Saturdays, that they may not meet.
The Neutrality (287) begins to break out, and threatens to be an
excise or convention.  The newspapers are full of it, and the
press teems.  It has already produced three pieces: "The Groans
of Germany," which I will send you by the first
opportunity: "Bedlam, a poem on His Maj'esty's happy escape from
his German dominions, and all the wisdom of his conduct there."
The title of this is all that is remarkable in it.  The third
piece is a ballad, which, not for the goodness, but for the
excessive abuse of it, I shall transcribe:

         THE LATE GALLANT EXPLOITS OF A FAMOUS BALANCING CAPTAIN.
           A NEW SONG.  TO THE TUNE OF THE KING AND THE MILLER.

                 Mene tekel.  The handwriting on the wall.

1. I'll tell you a story as strange as 'tis new,
Which all, who're concerned, will allow to be true,
Of a Balancing Captain, well-known herabouts,
Returned home, God save him as a mere King of Clouts.

2. This Captain he takes, in a gold-ballast'd ship,
Each summer to Terra damnosa a trip,
For which he begs, borrows, scrapes all he can get,
And runs his poor Owners most vilely in debt.

3. The last time he set out for this blessed place,
He met them, and told them a most piteous case,
Of a Sister of his, who, though bred up at court,
Was ready to perish for want of support.

4. This Hungry Sister, he then did pretend,
Would be to his Owners a notable friend,
If they would at that critical junction supply her-
 They did-but alas! all the fat's in the fire!

5. This our Captain no sooner had finger'd the cole,
But he hies him abroad with his good Madam Vole-
Where, like a true tinker, he managed this metal,
And while he stopp'd one hole, made ten in the kettle.

6. His Sister, whom he to his Owners had,,;worn,
To see duly settled before his return,
He gulls with bad messages sent to and fro,
Whilst he underhand claps up a peace with her foe.

7. on He then turns this Sister adrift, and declares
Her most mortal foes were her Father's right heirs-
"G-d z-ds!" cries the world, "such a step was ne'er taken!"
"O, ho!" says Nol Bluff, "I have saved my own bacon."

8. Let France damn the Germans, and undam the Dutch,
And Spain on Old England pish ever so much,
Let Russia bang Sweden, or Sweden bang that,
I care not, by Robert! one kick of my hat.

9. So I by myself can noun substantive stand,
Impose on my Owners, and save my own land;
You call me masculine, feminine, neuter, or block,
Be what will the gender, sirs, hic, haec, or hoc.

10. Or should my choused Owners begin to look sour,
I'll trust to Mate Bob to exert his old power,
Regit animos dictis, or nummis, with ease,
So, spite of your growling, I'll act as I please."

11. Yet worse in this treacherous contract, 'tis said,
Such terms are agreed to, such promises made,
That his Owners must soon feeble beggars become-
"Hold!" cries the crown office, "'twere scandal-so, mum!"

12. This secret, however, must out on the day
When he meets his poor Owners to ask for more pay;
And I fear when they come to adjust the account,
zero for balance will prove their amount.

One or two of the stanzas are tolerable; some, especially the
ninth, most nonsensically bad.  However, this is a specimen of
what we shall have amply commented upon in parliament.

I have already found out a person, who, I believe, will please
you, in Palombo's place: I am to see your brother about it
to-morrow, and next post you shall hear more particularly.
I am quite in concern for the poor prinCess,(289) and her
conjugal and amorous distresses: I really pity them; were they in
England, we should have all the old prudes dealing out
judgments on her, and mumbling toothless ditties to the tune of
Pride will have a fall.  I am bringing some fans and
trifles for her, si mignons! Good night.
Yours ever.

a creature of the great duke's favourite minister, had the chief
ascendant and power there.



186 Letter 40
To Sir Horace Mann.
Downing Street, Nov. 5, 1741, O. S.

I just mentioned to you in my letter on Monday, that I had found
such a person as you wanted; I have since seen your
brother, who is so satisfied with him, that he was for sending
him directly away to you, without staying six weeks for an answer
from you, but I chose to have your consent.  He is the son of a
tradesman in this city, so not yet a fine gentleman.  He is
between fifteen and sixteen, but very tall of his age: he was
disappointed in not going to a merchant at Genoa, as was
intended; but was so far provided for it as to have
learned Italian three months: he speaks French very well,
writes a good hand, and casts accounts; so, you see there will
not be much trouble in forming him to your purpose.  He will go
to you for twenty pounds a-year and his lodging.  If you like
this, Nvrite me word by the first post, and he shall set out
directly.

We hear to-day that the Toulon squadron is airived at
Barcelona; I don't like it of' all things, for it has a look
towards Tuscany.  If it is suffered to go thither quietly, it
will be no small addition to the present discontents.

Here is another letter, which I am entreated to send you, from
poor Amorevoli; he has a continued fever, though not a high one.
Yesterday, Monticelli was taken ill, so there will be no opera on
Saturday; nor was on Tuesday.  MOnticelli is
infinitely admired; next to Farinelli.  The Viscontina is
admired more than liked.  The music displeases every body, and
the dances.  I am quite uneasy about the opera, for Mr. Conway is
one of' the directors, and I fear they will lose
considerably, which he cannot afford.  There are eight; Lord
Middlesex, (290) Lord Holderness, Mr. Frederick, (291) Lord
Conway, (292) Mr. Conway, (293) Mr. Damer, (294) Lord Brook,
(295) and Mr. Brand. (296) The five last are directed by the
three first; they by the first, and he by the Abb`e Vanneschi,
(297) who will make a pretty sum.  I Will give YOU Some
instances; not to mention the improbability of eight young
thoughtless men of fashion understanding economy -. it is
usual to give the poet fifty guineas for composing the
books-Vanneschi and Rolli are allowed three hundred.  Three
hundred more VannesChi had for his journey to Italy to pick up
dancers and performers, which was always as well transacted by
bankers there.  Be has additionally brought over an Italian
tailor-because there are none here!  They have already given this
Taylorini four hundred pounds, and he has already taken a house
of thirty pounds a-year.  Monticelli and the Visconti are to have
a thousand guineas apiece; Amorevoli eight hundred and fifty:
this at the rate of the great singers, is not so extravagant; but
to the Muscovita (though the second woman never had above four
hundred,) they give six; that is for
secret services. (298) By this you may judge of their
frugality! I am quite uneasy for poor Harry, who will thus be to
pay for Lord Middlesex's pleasures! Good night; I have not time
now to write more.
Yours, ever.

(290) Charles Sackville, Earl of Middlesex, and subsequently
second Duke of Dorset, eldest son of Lionel, first Duke of
Dorset.  He was made a lord of the treasury in 1743, and
master of the horse to Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1747-D.

(291) John Frederick, Esq. afterwards Sir John Frederick,
Bart. by the death of his cousin, Sir Thomas.  He was a
commissioner of customs, and member of parliament for West
Looe.-D.

(292) Francis Seymour Conway, first Earl and Marquis of
Hertford, ambassador at Paris, lord chamberlain of the
household, etc.-D.

(293) Henry Seymour Conway, afterwards secretary of state, and a
field marshal in the army.-D.

(294) Joseph Damer, Esq. created in 1753 Baron Milton, in
Ireland, and by George III. an English peer, by the same
title, and eventually Earl of Dorchester.-D.

(295) Francis Greville, eighth Lord Brooke; created in 1746 Earl
Brooke, and in 1759 Earl of Warwick.-D.

(296) Mr. Brand of the Hoo, in Hertfordshire, one of the
original members of the society of Dilettanti.--D.

(297) If this anticipation of Walpole's was ever realized, "the
pretty sum" was eventually lost on the spot where it had been
gained.  Vanneschi, having in 1753 undertaken the
management of the opera-house on his own account, continued it
until 1756, when his differences with Mingotti, which excited
almost as much of the public attention as the rivalries of Handel
and Bononcini or of Faustina and Cuzzoni, completely prejudiced
the public against him, and eventually ended in making him a
bankrupt, a prisoner in the Fleet, and at last a fugitive.-E.

(298) She was kept by Lord Middlesex.



187 Letter 41
To Sir Horace Mann.
Downing Street, Nov. 12, 1741.

Nothing is equal to my uneasiness about you.  I hear or think of
nothing but Spanish embarkations for Tuscany: before you receive
this, perhaps, they will be at Leghorn.  Then, your brother tells
me you have received none of my letters.  He knows I have never
failed writing once a week, if not twice.  We have had no letters
from You this post.  I shall not have the least respite from
anxiety, till I hear about you, and what you design to do. it is
immpossible but the great duke must lose Tuscany; and I suppose
it is as certain, (I speak on probabilities, for, upon honour, I
know nothing of the
matter,) that as soon as there is a peace, we shall
acknowledge Don Philip, and then you may return to Florence
again.  In the mean while I will ask Sir R. if it is possible to
get your appointments continued, while you stay in
readiness at Bologna, Rome, Lucca, or where you choose.  I talk
at random; but as I think so much of you, I am trying to find out
something that may be of service to you.  I write in infinite
hurry, and am called away, so scarce know what I say.  Lord
Conway and his family are this instant come to town, and have
sent for me.

It is Admiral Vernon's birthday, (299) and the city-shops are
full of favours, the streets of marrowbones and cleavers, and the
night will be full of mobbing, bonfires, and lights.

The opera does not succeed; Amorevoli has not sung yet; here is a
letter to his wife; mind, while he is ill, he sends to the
Chiaretta!  The dances are infamous and ordinary.  Lord
Chesterfield was told that the Viscontina said she was but
four-and-twenty: he answered, "I suppose she means
four-and-twenty stone!"

There is a mad parson goes about; he called to a sentinel the
other day in the Park; "Did you ever see the Leviathan?"
"No." "Well, he is as like Sir.  R. W. as ever two devils were
like one another."

Never was such unwholesome weather! I have a great cold, and have
not been well this fortnight: even immortal majesty has had a
looseness.

The Duke of Ancaster (300) and Lord James Cavendish (301) are
dead.

This is all the news I know: I would I had time to write more;
but I know you will excuse me now.  If I wrote more, it would be
still about the Italian expedition, I am so disturbed about it.
Yours, ever.

(299) Admiral Vernon was now in the height of his popularity, in
consequence of his successful attack upon Porto-Bello, in
November, 1739, and the great gallantry he had shown upon that
occasion.  His determined and violen't opposition, as a member of
parliament, to the measures of the government, assisted in
rendering him the idol of the mob, which he continued for many
years.-D.  [The admiral was actually elected for Rochester,
Ipswich, and Penryn: he'was also set up for the City of
London, where he was beaten by two thousand votes; and in
Westminster, where he was beaten by four hundred.  After the
affair of Porto-Bello, he took Chagre, and continued in the
service till 1748; when several matters which had passed
between him and the lords of the admiralty being laid before the
king, be was struck off the list of flag officers. He died in
1757.  A handsome monument was erected to his memory in
Westminster Abbey.]

(300) Peregrine Bertie, second Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven,
great chamberlain of England, and chief justice in Eyre, north of
Trent.  The report of his death was premature.  His grace
survived till the 1st of January.-E.

(301) The second son of William, second Duke of Devonshire.  He
was colonel of a regiment of foot-guards, and member for
Malton.-E.



189 Letter 42
To Sir Horace Mann.
Downing Street, Nov. 23, 1741.

Your letter has comforted me much, if it can be called comfort to
have one's uncertainty fluctuate to the better side.  You make me
hope that the Spaniards design on Lombardy ; my
passion for Tuscany, and anxiety for you, make me eager to
believe it; but alas!  while I am in the belief of this, they may
be in the act of conquest in Florence, and poor you
retiring politically!  How delightful is Mr. Chute for
cleaving unto you like Ruth!  "Whither thou goest, I will go; and
where thou lodgest, I will lodge!" As to the merchants of Leghorn
and their concerns, Sir R. thinks you are mistaken, and that if
the Spaniards come thither, they will by no means be safe.  I own
I write to you under a great dilemma; I
flatter myself, all is well with you; but if not, how
disagreeable to have one's letters fall into strange hands.  I
write, however.

A brother Of Mine, (302) Edward by name, has lately had a call to
matrimony: the virgins name was Howe. (303) He had agreed to take
her with no fortune, she him with his four children.  The father
of him, to get rid of his importunities, at last acquiesced.  The
very moment he had obtained this consent, he repented; and,
instead of flying on the wings of love to
notify it, he went to his fair One, owned his father had
mollified, but hoped she would be so good as to excuse him.
You cannot imagine what an entertaining fourth act of the
opera we had the other night.  Lord Vane, (304) in the middle of
the pit, making love to my lady.  The Duke of Newcastle (305) has
lately given him three-score thousand pounds, to consent to cut
off the entail of the Newcastle estate.  The fool immediately
wrote to his wife, to beg she would return to him from Lord
Berkeley; that he had got so much money, and now they might live
comfortably: but she will not live
comfortably: she is at Lord Berkeley's house, whither go
divers after her.  Lady Townshend told me an admirable
history; it is of our friend Lady Pomfret.  Somebody that
belonged to the Prince of Wales said, they were going to
Court; it was objected that they ought to say, going to
Carlton House; that the only Court is where the king resides.
Lady P. with her paltry air of significant learning and
absurdity, said, "Oh Lord! is there no Court in England, but the
king's? sure, there are many more! There is the Court of
Chancery, the Court of Exchequer, the Court of King's Bench,
etc." Don't you love her?  Lord Lincoln does her dauhter: he is
come over, and met her the other night: he turned pale, spoke to
her several times in the evening, but not long, and sighed to me
at going away.  He came over all alive; and not only his
uncle-duke, but even majesty is fallen in love with him.  He
talked to the king at his levee, without being spoken to.  That
was always thought high treason; but I don't know how the gruff
gentleman liked it; and then he had been told that Lord Lincoln
designed to have made the campaicn, if we had gone to war; in
short, he says, Lord Lincoln (306) is the handsomest man in
England

I believe I told you that Vernon's birthday passed quietly, but
it was not designed to be pacific; for at twelve at night, eight
gentlemen, dressed like sailors, and masked, went round Covent
Garden with a drum, beating up for a volunteer mob, but it did
not take; and they retired to a great supper that was prepared
for them at the Bedford Head, and ordered by
Whitehead (307) the author of Manners.  It has been written into
the country that Sir R. has had two fits of an apoplexy, and
cannot live till Christmas; but I think he is recovered to be as
well as ever.  To-morrow se'nnight is the Day! (308)  It is
critical.  You shall hear faithfully.

The opera takes: Monticelli (309) pleases almost equal to
Farinelli: Amorevoli is much liked; but the poor, fine
Viscontina scarce at all. (310)I carry the two former to-night to
my Lady Townshend's.

Lord Coventry (311) has had his son thrown out by the party: he
went to Carlton House; the prince asked him about the
election.  "Sir," said he, "the Tories have betrayed me, as they
will you, the first time you have occasion for them."  The
merchants have petitioned the King for more guardships.  My lord
president, (312) referred them to the Admiralty; but they bluntly
refused to go, and said they would have redress from the King
himself.

I am called down to dinner, and cannot write more now.  I will
thank dear Mr. Chute and the Grifona next post.  I hope she and
you liked your things.  Good night, my dearest child! Your
brother and I sit upon your affairs every morning.
Yours ever.

(302) Second son of Sir Robert Walpole.  He was clerk of the
pells, and afterwards knight of the Bath. [Sir Edward died
unmarried, in 1784, leaving three natural daughters; Laura,
married to the Hon. and
Rev.  Frederick Keppel, afterwards Bishop of Exeter; maria,
married, first to the Earl of Waldegrave, and, secondly to the
Duke of Gloucester; and Charlotte, married to the
Earl of Dysart.]

(303) Eldest sister of the Lord Viscount Howe.  She was soon
after this married to a relation of her own name. [John
Howe, Esq. of Hanslop, Bucks.]

(304) William, second Viscount Vane, in Ireland.  His "lady" was
the too-celebrated Lady Vane, first married to
Lord William Hamilton, and secondly to Lord Vane; who has
given her own extraordinary and disreputable adventures to the
world, in Smollett's novel of "Peregrine Pickle," under the title
of "Memoirs of a Lady of Quality." She is also
immortalized in different ways, by Johnson, in his ,Vanity of
Human Wishes," and by Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, in one of his
Odes.-D. [She was the daughter of Mr. Hawes, a South Sea
director, and died in 1788.  Lord Vane died in 1789.  Boswell
distinctly states, that the lady mnentioned in Johnson's
couplet "was not the celebrated Lady Vane, whose Memoirs were
given to the public by Dr. Smollett, but Ann Vane, who was
mistress to Frederick Prince of Wales, and died in 1736, not long
before Johnson settled in London."  See Boswell's
Johnson, vol. i. p. 226, ed. 1835.]

(305) Uncle of Lord Vane, whose father, Lord Barnard, had
married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Gilbert Holles, Earl of
Clare, and sister and coheir of John Duke of Newcastle.

(306) Henry Clinton, ninth Earl of Lincoln, succeeded as
Duke of Newcastle in 1768, on the death of his uncle, the
minister.

(307) Paul Whitehead, a satirical poet of bad character, was the
son of a tailor, who lived in Castle-yard, Holborn.  He wrote
several abusive poems, now forgotten, entitled "The
State Dances," "Manners," "The Gymnasiad," etc.  In "Manners,"
having attacked some members of the House of Lords, that assembly
summoned Dodsley, the publisher, before them, (Whitehead having
absconded,) and subsequently imprisoned him.  In politics,
Whitehead was a follower of Bubb Dodington; in private life be
was the friend and companion of the profligate Sir Francis
Dashwood, Wilkes, Churchill, etc. and, like them, was a member of
the Hell-fire Club, which held its orgies at Mednam Abbey, in
Bucks.  The estimation in which he was held even by his friends
may be judged of by the lines in which Churchill has damned him
to everlasting fame:

"May I (can worse disgrace on mankind fall?)
Be born a Whitehead and baptized a Paul."

Paul Whitehead died in 1774.-D.  [The proceedings in the
House of Lords against the author of "Manners" which took
place in February, 1739, was, in the opinion of Dr. Johnson,
"intended rather to intimidate Pope, than to punish
Whitehead."]

(308) The day the parliament was to meet.

(309) His voice was clear, sweet, and free from defects of every
kind.  He was a chaste performer, and never hazarded any
difficulty which he was not certain of executing with the utmost
precision.  He was, moreover, an excellent actor, so that nothing
but the recent remembrance of the gigantic
talents of Farinelli, and the grand and majestic style of
Senesino, could have lefl an English audience any thing to
wish.-E.

(310) Amorevoli was an admirable tenor.  "I have heard,"
says Dr. Burney, "better voices of his pitch, but
never, on the stage, more taste and expression.  The
Visconti had a shrill flexible voice, and pleased more in
rapid songs than those that required high colouring and
pathos."-E.

(311) William, fifth Earl of Coventry.  He died in 1751.-D.

(312) Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington, a man of moderate
abilities, but who had filled many great offices.  He died in
1743, when his titles extinguished.-D.



191 Letter 43
To Sir Horace Mann.
Nov. 26, 1741.

I don't write you a very long letter, because you will see the
inclosed to Mr. Chute.  I forgot to thank you last post for the
songs, and your design on the Maltese cats.

It is terrible to be in this uncertainty about you! We have not
the least news about the Spaniards, more than what you told us,
of a few vessels being seen off Leghorn.  I send
about the post, and ask Sir R. a thousand times a-day.

I beg to know if you have never heard any thing from Parker about
my statue: (313) it was to have been finished last june.  What is
the meaning he does not mention it? If it is done, I beg it may
not stir from Rome till there is no more danger of Spaniards.

If you get out of your hurry, I will trouble you with a new
commission: I find I cannot live without Stosch's (314)
intaglio of the Gladiator, with the vase, upon a granite.  You
know I offered him fifty pounds: I think, rather than not have
it, I would give a hundred.  What will he do if the Spaniards
should come to Florence? Should he be driven to straits,
perhaps he would part with his Meleager too.  You see I am as
eager about baubles as if I were going to Louis at the Palazzo
Vecchio! You can't think what a closet I have fitted up; such a
mixture of French gaiety and Roman virtu! you would be in love
with it: I have not rested till it was finished: I long to have
you see it. Now I am angry that I did not buy the
Hermaphrodite; the man would have sold it for twenty-five
sequins: do buy it for me; it was a friend of Bianchi.  Can you
forgive me'! I write all this upon the hope and
presumption that the Spaniards go to Lombardy.  Good night.
Yours, ever.

(313) A copy of the Livia Mattei, which Mr. W. designed for a
tomb of his mother: it was erected in Henry VII.'s Chapel, in
Westminster Abbey, in 1754.

(314) He gave it afterwards to Lord Duncannon, for procuring him
the arrears of his pension.



192 Letter 44
To Sir Horace Mann.
Downing Street, Dec. 3, 1741, O. S.


Here I have two letters from you to answer.  You cannot
conceive my joy on the prospect of the Spaniards going to
Lombardy: all advices seem to confirm it.  There is no telling
you what I have felt, and shall feel, till I am certain you are
secure.  You ask me about Admiral Haddock; you must not wonder
that I have told you nothing of him: they know nothing of him
here.  He had discretionary powers to act as he should judge
proper from his notices.  He has been keeping in the Spanish
fleet at Cales. (315)  Sir R. says, if he had let that go out, to
prevent the embarkation, the Tories would have
complained, and said he had favoured the Spanish trade, under pre
tence of hindering an expedition which was never designed.  It
was strongly reported last week that Haddock had shot
himself; a satire on his having been neutral, as they call it.
The parliament met the day before yesterday, and there were four
hundred and eighty-seven members present.  They did no business,
only proceeded to choose a speaker, which was,
unanimously, Mr. Onslow, moved for by Mr. Pelham, (316) and
seconded by Mr. Clutterbuck.  But the Opposition, to flatter his
pretence to popularity and impartiality, call him their own
speaker.  They intend to oppose Mr. Earle's being chairman of the
committee, and to set up a Dr. Lee, a civilian.  To- morrow the
King makes his speech.  Well, I won't keep you any longer in
suspense.  The Court will have a majority of forty-a vast number
for the outset: a good majority, like a good sum of money, soon
makes itself bigger.  The first great point will be the
Westminster election; another, Mr. Pultney's (317) election at
Heydon; Mr. Chute's brother is one of the
petitioners.  It will be an ugly affair for the Court, for
Pultney has asked votes of the courtiers, and said Sir R. was
indifferent about it; but he is warmer than I almost ever saw
him, and declared to Churchill, (318) of whom Pultney claims a
promise, that he must take Walpole or Pultney.  The Sackville
finally were engaged too, by means of George Berkeley, brother to
Lady Betty Germain, (319) whose influence with the Dorset I
suppose you know; but the King was so hot with his grace about
his sons, that I believe they will not venture to follow their
inclinations **** to vote (320) for Pultney, though he has
expressed great concern about it to Sir R.

So much for politics! for I suppose you know that Prague is taken
by storm, in a night's time.  I forgot to tell you that Commodore
Lestock, with twelve ships, has been waiting for a wind this
fortnight, to join Haddock. (321)

I write to you in defiance of a violent headache, which I got
last night at another of Sir T. Robinson's balls.  There were six
hundred invited, and I believe above two hundred there.  Lord
Lincoln, out of prudence, danced with Lady Caroline
Fitzroy, and Mr. Conway, with Lady Sophia; the two couple were
just mismatched, as every body soon perceived, by the
attentions of each man to the woman he did not dance with, and
the emulation of either lady: it was an admirable scene.  The
ball broke up at three; but Lincoln, Lord Holderness, Lord Robert
Sutton, (322) Young Churchill (323) and a dozen more grew 'oily,'
stayed till seven in the morning, and drank
thirty-two bottles.


I will take great care to send the knee-buckles and
pocket-book; I have got them, and Madame Pucci's silks, and only
wait to hear that Tuscany is quiet, and then I will
convey them by the first ship.  I would write to them
to-night, but have not time now; old Cibber, (324) plays
to-night, and all the world will be there.

Here is another letter from Amorevoli, who is out of his wits at
not hearing from his wife.  Adieu! my dearest child.  How happy
shall I be when I know you are in peace;
Yours, ever.

(315) Cadiz.

(316) The Right Hon. Henry Pelham, so long in conjunction with
his brother, the Duke of Newcastle, one of the principal
rulers of this country.  He was a man of some ability, and a
tolerable speaker.  The vacillations, the absurdity, the
foolish jealousy of the duke, greatly injured the stability and
respectability of Mr. Pelham's administration.  Mr. Pelham was
born in 1696, and died in 1754.-D.


(317) William Pulteney, afterwards Earl of Bath, whose
character and history are too well known to require to be here
enlarged upon.-D.

(318) General Charles Churchill, groom of the bedchamber to the
King.

(319) Lady Betty Berkeley, married to the notorious adventurer
and gambler, Sir John Germain, who had previously married the
divorced Duchess of Norfolk, (Lady Mary Mordaunt,) by whose
bequest he became possessed of the estate of Drayton, in
Northamptonshire, which he left on his own death to Lady
Betty, his second @wife.  Lady Betty left it to Lord George
Sackville, third son of Lionel first Duke of Dorset.  Sir John
Germain was so ignorant, that he is said to have left a legacy to
Fair Matthew Decker, as the author of St. Matthew's
Gospel.-D.

(320) sic, in the manuscript.-D.

(321) But for this circumstance, and the junction of the
French squadron, Haddock would certainly have destroyed the
Spanish fleet, and thereby escaped the imputation which was
circulated with much industry, that his hands had been tied up by
a neutrality entered into for Hanover; than which nothing could
be more false.  These reports, though ostensibly
directed against Haddock, were, in reality, aimed at Sir
Robert Walpole, a general election being at hand, and his
opponents wishing to render him as unpopular with the people as
possible.-E.

(322) Second son of John, third Duke of Rutland.  He took the
name of Sutton, on inheriting the estate of his maternal
grandfather, Robert Sutton, Lord Lexington.-D.

(323) Natural son of General Charles Churchill, afterwards
married to Mary, daughter of Sir Robert Walpole.-D.

(324) Colley Cibber, the celebrated dramatic author and actor.
He had left the stage in 1731; but still occasionally acted, in
spite of his age, for he was now seventy.-D. [For those
occasional performances he is said to have had fifty guineas per
night.  So late as 1745, he appeared in the character of
Pandulph, the pope's legate, in his own tragedy, called "Papal
Tyranny."  He died in 1757.]



194 letter 45
To Sir Horace Mann.
Somerset House, (for I write to you wherever I find myself,) Dec.
10, 1741.

I have got no letter from you yet, the post should have
brought it yesterday.  The Gazette says, that the cardinal (325)
has declared that they will suffer no expedition against Tuscany.
I wish he had told me so! if they preserve this
guarantee, personally, I can forgive their breaking the rest.
But I long for your letter; every letter now from each of us is
material.  You will be almost as impatient to hear of the
parliament, as I of Florence.  The lords on Friday went upon the
King's speech; Lord Chesterfield made a very fine speech against
the address, all levelled at the House of Hanover.  Lord
Cholmley, they say, answered him well.  Lord Halifax
(326) spoke Very ill, and was answered by little Lord Raymond,
(327) who always will answer him.  Your friend Lord Sandwich
(328) affronted his grace of Grafton, (329) extremely, who was
ill, and sat out of his place, by calling him to order; it was
indecent in such a boy to a man of his age and rank: the
blood of Fitzroy will not easily pardon it.  The court had a
majority of forty-one, with some converts.

On Tuesday we had the Speech; there were great differences among
the party; the Jacobites, with Shippen (330) and Lord Noel
Somerset at their head, were for a division, Pultney and the
Patriots against one; (332) the ill success in the House of lords
had frightened them; we had no division, but a very warm battle
between Sir.  R.  and Poltney.  The latter made a fine speech,
very personal, on the state of affairs.  Sir R. with as much
health, as much spirits, as much force and
command as ever, answered him for an hour; said, He hadbeen taxed
with all our misfortunes; but did he raise the war in Germany? or
advise the war with Spain? did he kill the late Emperor or King
of Prussia?' did he counsel this King? or was he first minister
to the King of Poland?  did he kindle the war betwixt Muscovy and
Sweden?" For our troubles at home, he said, "all the grievances
of this nation were owing to the Patriots." They laughed much at
this; but does he want proofs of it?  he said, They talked much
of an equilibrium in this parliament, (333) and of what they
designed against him; if it was so, the sooner he knew it the
better; and there-fore if any man would move for a day to examine
the state of the
nation, he would second it." Mr. Pultney did move for it; Sir R.
did second it, and it is fixed for the twenty-first of
January.  Sir R. repeated some words of Lord Chesterfield's in
the House of Lords, that this was a time for truth, for plain
truth for English truth, and hinted at the reception (334) his
lordship had met in France.  After these speeches of such
consequence, and from such men, Mr. Lyttelton (335) got up to
justify, or rather to flatter Lord Chesterfield, though every
body then had forgot that he had been mentioned.  Danvers
(336) who is a rough, rude beast, but now and then mouths out
some humour, said, "that Mr. P. and Sir R. were like two old
bawds, debauching young members."

That day was a day of triumph, but yesterday (Wednesday) the
streamers of victory did not fly so gallantly.  It was the day of
receiving petitions; Mr. Pultney presented an immense
piece of parchment, which he said he could but just lift; it was
the Westminster petition, and is to be heard next Tuesday, when
we shall all have our brains knocked out by the mob; so if you
don't hear from me next post, you will conclude my head was a
little out of order.  After this we went upon a cornish petition,
presented by Sir William Yonge, (337) which drew on a debate and
a division, when lo! we were but 222 to 215-how do you like a
majority of seven? The Opposition triumphs
highly, and with reason; one or two such victories, as
Pyrrhus, the member for Macedon, said, will be the ruin of us.  I
look upon it now, that the question is, Downing Street or the
Tower; will you come and see a body, if one should happen to
lodge at the latter?  There are a thousand pretty things to amuse
you; the lions, the Armoury, the crown, and the axe that beheaded
Anna Bullon.  I design to make interest for the room where the
two princes were smothered; in long winter evenings, when one
wants company, (for I don't suppose that many people will
frequent me then,) one may sit and scribble verses
against Crouch-back'd Richard, and dirges on the sweet babes.  If
I die there, and have my body thrown into a wood, I am too old to
be buried by robin redbreasts, am not I?

Bootle, (338) the prince's chancellor, made a most long and
stupid speech; afterwards, Sir R. called to him, "Brother
Bootle, take care you don't get my old name."  "What's that?"
"Blunderer."

You can't conceive how I was pleased with the vast and
deserved applause that Mr. Chute's (339) brother, the lawyer,
got: I never heard a clearer or a finer speech.  When I went
home, "Dear Sir," said I to Sir R. "I hope Mr. Chute will
carry his election for Heydon; he would be a great loss to you."
He replied. "We will not lose him."  I, who meddle with nothing,
especially elections, and go to no committees,
interest myself extremely for Mr. Chute.

Old Marlborough (340) is dying-but who can tell! last year she
had lain a great while ill, without speaking; her physicians
said, "She must be blistered, or she will die." She called out,
"I won't be blistered, and I won't die." If she takes the same
resolution now, I don't believe she will. (341)

Adieu! my dear child: I have but room to say, yours, ever.

(325) Cardinal Fleury, first minister of France.

(326) George Montague Dunk, second Earl of Halifax, of the last
creation.  Under the reign of George III., he became
secretary of state, and was so unfortunate in that capacity as to
be the opponent of Wilkes, on the subject of General
Warrants, by which he is now principally remembered.-D.

(327) Robert, second Lord Raymond, only son of the chief
justice of that name and title.-D.

(328) John Montagu, fourth Earl of Sandwich, passed through a
long life of office, and left behind him n indifferent
character, both in public and private He was, however, a man of
some ability.-D.

(329) Charles Fitzroy, second Duke of Grafton, and grandson of
Charles II., was a person of considerable weight and influence at
the court of George II., where he long held the post of
chamberlain of the household.

(330) "Honest Will Shippen," as he was called, or ,Downright
Shippen," as Pope terms him, was a zealous Jacobite member of
parliament, possessed of considerable talents, and a vehement
opposer of Sir Robert Walpole's government.  He, however, did
justice to that able minister, for he was accustomed to say,
"Robin and I are honest men; but as for those fellows in long
perriwigs" (meaning the Tories of the day,) " they only want to
get into office themselves." He was the author of a
satirical poem, entitled, "Faction Displayed," which possesses
considerable merit.-D. [Shippen was born in 1672, and died in
1743.  Sir Robert Walpole repeatedly declared, that he would not
say who was corrupted, but he would say who was not
corruptible-that man was Shippen.  His speeches generally
contained some pointed period, which he uttered with great
animation.  He usually spoke in a low tone of voice, with too
great rapidity, and held his glove before his mouth.]

(331) Lord Charles Noel Somerset, second son of Henry, second
Duke of Beaufort.  He succeeded to the family honours in 1746,
when his elder brother, Henry, the third duke, died without
children.-D. [After the death of Sir William Wyndham, which
happened in 1740, Lord Noel Somerset was considered as the rising
head of the Tory interest.  "He was," says Tindal, "a man of
sense, spirit, and activity, unblameable in his morals, but
questionable in his political capacity." He died in 1756.)

(332) Mr. Pulteney declared against dividing; observing, with a
witticism, that "dividing was not the way to multiply."

(333) In speaking of the balance of power, Mr. Pulteney had said,
,He did not know how it was abroad, not being in
secrets, but congratulated the House, that he had not, for these
many years, known it so near an equilibrium as it now was
there."-E.

(334) Lord Chesterfield had been sent by the party, in the
preceding September, to France, to request the Duke of Ormond (at
Avignon,) to obtain the Pretender's order to the
Jacobites, to vote against Sir R. W. upon any question
whatever; many of them having either voted for him, or
retired, on the famous motion the last year for removing him from
the, King's councils. [Lord Chesterfield's biographer, Dr. Maty
states that the object of his lordship's visit to France was the
restoration of his health, which required the assistance of a
warmer climate.  The reception he met with during his short stay
at Paris, is thus noticed in a letter from Mr. Pitt, of the 10th
of September:-" I hope you liked the court of France as well as
it liked you.  The uncommon distinctions I hear the Cardinal
(Fleury) showed you, are the best proof that, old as he is, his
judgment is as good as
ever.  As this great minister has taken so much of his idea, of
the men in power here, from the person of a great
negotiator who has left the stage, (Lord Waldegrave,) I am very
glad he has, had an opportunity, once before he dies, of forming
an idea of those out of power from my Lord
Chesterfield." See Chatham Correspondence, vol. i. p. 3.]

(335) George Lyttelton, afterwards created Lord lyttelton.-D.

(336) Joseph Danvers, Esq. of Swithland, in the county of
Leicester, at this time member for Totness.  In 1746 he was
created a baronet.  He married Frances, the daughter of thomas
babington, Esq. of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire.-E.

(337) the Right Hon. Sir William Yonge, Bart., secretary at war,
to which office he had succeeded in May, 1735.  Walpole, who
tells us (Memoires, i. p. 20,) that " he was vain,
extravagant, and trifling; simple out of the House, and too ready
at assertions in it," adds, "that his vivacity and
parts, whatever the cause was, made him shine, and he was
always content with the lustre that accompanied fame, without
thinking of what was reflected from rewarded fame-a convenient
ambition to ministers, who had few such disinterested
combatants.  Sir Robert Walpole always said of him 'that
nothing but Yonge's character could keep down his parts, and
nothing but his parts support his character.'"  That these parts
were very great is shown by the fact, that Sir Robert Walpole
often, when he did not care to enter early into the debate
himself, gave Yonge his notes, as the latter came late into the
House, from which be could speak admirably and
fluently, though he had missed the preceding discussion.  Sir
William, who had a proneness to poetry, wrote the epilogue to
Johnson's tragedy of "Irene."  'When I published the plan for my
Dictionary," says the Doctor, "Lord'Chesterfield told me that the
word great should be pronounced so as to rhyme to state; and Sir
William Yonge sent me word, that it should be pronounced so as to
rhyme to seat, and that none but an
Irishman would pronounce it great.  Now, here were two men of the
highest rank, the one the best speaker in the House of Lords, the
other the best speaker in the House of Commons, differing
entirely." See Boswell's Johnson,vol.iii.p.191.


(338) Sir Thomas Bootle, chancellor to the Prince of Wales; a
dull, heavy man, and who is, therefore, ironically called, by Sir
C. H. Williams, "Bright Bootle,"-D.

(339) Francis Chute, an eminent lawyer, second brother of
Anthony Chute, of the Vine, in Hampshire, had, in concert with
Luke Robinson, another lawyer, disputed Mr. Pultney's borough of
Heydon with him at the general elections and been returned but on
a petition, and the removal of Sir R. W. they were
voted out of their seats, and Mr. Chute died soon after.-E.

(340) Sarah, Dowager Duchess of Marlborough.

(341) Nor did she, Her grace survived the date of this letter
nearly three years.  She died on the 18th of October 1744, being
then eighty-four years of age.-E.



197 Letter 46
To Sir Horace Mann.
Wednesday night, eleven o'clock, Dec. 16, 1741.

Remember this day.

Nous voil`a de la Minorit`e! entens-tu cela! h`e! My dear child,
since you will have these ugly words explained, they just mean
that we ar-- metamorphosed into the minority.  This was the night
of choosing a chairman of the committee of elections.  Gyles
Earle, (342) (as in the two last parliaments) was named by the
Court; Dr. Lee, (343) a civilian, by the Opposition, a man of a
fair character. (344)  Earle was formerly a dependent on the Duke
of Argyle,(345) is of remarkable covetousness and wit, which he
has dealt out largely against the Scotch and the Patriots.  It
was a day of much expectation, and both sides had raked together
all probabilities: I except near twenty who are in town, but stay
to vote on a second question, when the majority may be decided to
either party.  have you not read of such in story?
Men, who would not care to find themselves on the weaker side,
contrary to their intent.  In short, the determined sick were
dragged out of their beds; zeal came in a great coat.  There were
two vast dinners at two taverns, for either-party; at six we met
in the House.  Sir William Yonge, seconded by my uncle Horace,
(346) moved for Mr. Earle: Sir Paul Methuen (347) and Sir Watkyn
Williams (348) proposed Dr. Lee-and carried him, by a majority of
four: 242 against 238-the greatest number, I believe, that ever
lost a question.  You have no idea of their huzza! unless you can
conceive how people must triumph after defeats of twenty years
together.  We had one vote shut out, by coming a moment too late;
one that quitted us, for having been ill used by the Duke of
Newcastle but yesterday-for which in all probability, he will use
him well to-morrow-I mean, for quitting us. Sir Thomas
Lowther,(349) Lord Hartington's (350) uncle, was fetched down by
him and voted against us.  Young Ross,(351) son to a commissioner
of the customs, and saved from the dishonour of not liking to go
to the West Indies when it was his turn, by Sir R.s giving him a
lieutenancy, voted against us; and Tom Hervey,(352) who is always
with us, but is quite mad; and being asked why he left us,
replied, "Jesus knows my thoughts; one day I blaspheme, and pray
the next."  so, you see what accidents were against us, or we had
carried our point.  They cry, Sir R. miscalculated: how should he
calculate, when there are men like Ross, and fifty others he
could name! It was not very pleasant to be stared in the face to
see how one bore it-you can guess at my bearing it, who interest
myself so little about any thing.  I have had a taste of what I
am to meet from all sorts of people.  The moment we had lost the
question, I went from the heat of the house into the Speaker's
chamber, and there were some fifteen others of us-an under
door-keeper thought a question was new put, when it was not, and,
withou@ giving us notice, clapped the door to.  I asked him how
he dared lock us out without calling us: he replied insolently,
"It was his duty, and he would do it again:" one of
the party went to him, commended him, and told him he should be
punished if he acted otherwise.  Sir R. is in great spirits, and
still sanguine.  I have so little experience, that I shall not be
amazed at whatever scenes follow.  My dear child, we have
triumphed twenty years; is it strange that fortune should at last
forsake us; or ought we not always to expect it, especially in
this kingdom?  They talk loudly of the year forty-one, and
promise themselves all the confusions that began a hundred years
ago from the same date.  I hope they prognosticate wrong; but
should it be so, I can be happy in other places.  One reflection
I shall have, very sweet, though very melancholy; that if our
family is to be the sacrifice that shall first pamper discord, at
least the one,' the part of it that interested all my concerns,
and must have suffered from our ruin, is safe, secure, and above
the rage of confusion: nothing in this world can touch her peace
now!

To-morrow and Friday we go upon the Westminster election-you will
not wonder, shall you, if you hear the next post that we have
lost that too?  Good night.
Yours, ever.


(342) Giles Earle, Esq. one of the lords of the treasury and who
had been chairman of the committees of the House of Commons from
1727 to the date of this letter.  He had been successively groom
of the bedchamber to the Prince of Wales in 1718, clerk
comptroller of the King"s household in 1720, commissioner of the
Irish revenue in 1728, and a lord of the treasury in 1738.  Mr.
Earle was a man of broad coarse wit, and a lively image of his
style and sentiments has been preserved by Sir C. H. Williams, in
his "Dialogue between Giles Earle and Bubb Dodington."-E.

(343) George Lee, brother to the lord-chief justice; he was
appointed one of the lords of the admiralty on the following
change, which post he resigned on the disgrace of his patron,
Lord Granville.  He was designed by the Prince of Wales for his
first minister, and, immediately on the prince's death, was
appointed treasurer to the princess dowager, and soon after made
dean of the arches, a knight, and privy counsellor.  He died in
1758.

(344) In a letter to Dodington, written from Spa, on the 8th of
September, Lord Chesterfield says:-"I am for acting at the very
beginning of the session.  The court generally proposes some
servile and shameless tool of theirs to be chairman of the
committee of privileges.  Why should not we, therefore, pick up
some Whig of a fair character, and with personal connexions, to
set up in opposition? I think we should be pretty strong upon
this point."-E.

(345) John, the great Duke of Argyle and Greenwich.-D.

(346) Horace Walpole, younger brother of Sir Robert, created. in
his old age, Lord Walpole of Wolterton.  He was commonly called
"Old Horace," to distinguish him from his nephew, the writer of
these letters.-D.

(347) The son of John Methuen, Esq. the diplomatist, and author
of the celebrated Methuen treaty with Portugal.  Sir Paul was a
knight of the Bath, and died in 1757.-D.

(348) Sir Watkyn Williams Wynn, Bart. the third baronet of the
family, was long one of the leaders in the House of Commons.-D.
(349) Sir Thomas Lowther, Bart.  of Holker, in Lancashire.  He
had married Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, daughter of the second Duke
of Devonshire.-D.

(350) Afterwards the fourth Duke of Devonshire.

(351) Charles Ross, killed in flannders, at the battle of
Fontenoy, 1745.

(352) Thomas Hervey, second son of John, first Earl of Bristol,
'and Surveyor of the royal gardens.  He was at this time writing
his famous letter to Sir Thomas Hanmer. [With whose wife he had
eloped.  In the letter alluded to, he expresses his conviction
that his conduct was natural and delicate, and that, finally, in
heaven, Lady Hanmer, in the distribution of wives, would be
considered to be his.  Dr. Johnson (to whom he had left a legacy
of fifty pounds, but -,afterwards gave it him in his life-time)
characterises him as "very vicious."  " Alas!" observes Mr.
Croker, "it is but too probable that he was disordered in mind,
and that what was called vice was. in truth, disease, and
required a madhouse rather than a prison." He died in 1775.  See
Boswell's Johnson, Vol. iii.  P. 18, ed. 1835.)

(353) His mother, Catherine Lady Walpole, who died August 20,
1737.



199 Letter 47
To Sir Horace Mann.
Thursday, six o'clock. [Dec. 17, 1741.

You will hardly divine where I am writing to you-in the
Speaker's chamber.  The House is examining witnesses on the
Westminster election, which will not be determined to-day; I am
not in haste it should, for I believe we shall lose it.  A great
fat fellow, a constable, on their side, has just
deposed, that Lord Sundon,(355) and the high constable, took him
by the collar at the election, and threw him down stairs.  Do you
know the figure of Lord Sundon? If you do, only think of that
little old creature throwing any man down stairs!

As I was coming down this morning, your brother brought me a long
letter from you, in answer to mine of the 12th of
November.  You try to make me mistrust the designs of Spain
against Tuscany, but I will hope yet: hopes are all I have for
any thing I know!

As to the young man, I will see his mother the first moment I
can; and by next post, hope to give you a definite answer,
whether he will submit to be a servant or not; in every other
respect, I am sure he will please you.

Your friend, Mr. Fane,(356) would not come for us last night, nor
will vote till after the Westminster election: be is
brought into parliament by the Duke of Bedford,(357) and is
unwilling to disoblige him in this.  We flattered ourselves with
better success; for last Friday, after sitting till two in the
morning we carried a Cornish election in four
divisions-the first by a majority of six, then of twelve, then of
fourteen, and lastly by thirty-six.  You can't imagine the zeal
of the young men on both sides: Lord Fitzwilliam, Lord
Hartington, and my friend Coke (358) on ours, are warm as
possible; Lord Quarendon (359) and Sir Francis Dashwood (360) are
as violent on theirs: the former speaks often and well.  But I am
talking to you of nothing but parliament; why,
really, all one's ideas are stuffed with it, and you yourself
will not dislike to hear things so material.  The Opposition who
invent every method of killing Sir R., intend to make us sit on
Saturdays; but how mean and dirty is it, how
scandalous! when they can't ruin him by the least plausible
means, to murder him by denying him air and exercise.(361)
There was a strange affair happened on Saturday; it was
strange, yet very English.  One Nourse, an old gamester, said, in
the coffee-house, that Mr. Shuttleworth, a member, only pretended
to be ill.  This was told to Lord Windsor,(362) his friend, who
quarrelled with Nourse, and the latter challenged him.  My lord
replied, he would not fight him, he was too old.  The other
replied, he was not too old to fight with pistols.  Lord Windsor
still refused: Nourse, in a rage, went home and cut his own
throat.  This was one of the odd ways in which men are made.

I have scarce seen Lady Pomfret lately, but I am sure Lord
Lincoln is not going to marry her daughter.  I am not
surprised at her sister being shy of receiving civilities from
you-that was English too!

Say a great deal for me to the Chutes.  How I envy your snug
suppers! I never have such suppers! Trust me, if we fall, all the
grandeur, all the envied grandeur of our house, will not cost me
a sigh: it has given me no pleasure while we have it, and will
give me no pain when I part with it.  My liberty, my ease, and
choice of my own friends and company, will
sufficiently counterbalance the crowds of Downing-street. I am so
sick of it all, that if we are victorious or not, I propose
leaving England in the spring,.  Adieu!
Yours, ever and ever.

died in 1758, when all his honours, in default of male issue,
became extinct.]



201 Letter 48
To Sir Horace Mann.
Christmas eve, 1741.

My dearest child, if I had not heard regularly from you, what a
shock it would have given me! The other night at the opera, Mr.
Worseley, with his peevish face, half smiling through
ill-nature, told me (only mind!) by way of news, "that he
heard Mr. Mann was dead at Florence!"' How kind! To entertain one
with the chitchat of the town, a man comes and tells one that
one's dearest friend is dead! I am sure he would have lost his
speech if he had had any thing pleasurable to tell.  If ever
there is a metempsychosis, his soul will pass into a vulture and
prey upon carcases after a battle, and then go and bode at the
windows of their relations.  But I will say no more of him; I
will punish him sufficiently, if sufficiently there be, by
telling him you are perfectly well: you are, are you not? Send me
certificate signed by Dr. Cocchi,(363) and I will choke him with
it: another's health must be venomous to him.

Sir Francis Dashwood too,-as you know all ill-natured people hear
all ill news,-told me he heard you was ill: I vowed you was grown
as strong as the Farnese Hercules.  Then he desires you will send
him four of the Volterra urns, of the
chimney-piece size; send them with any of my things; do, or he
will think I neglected it because he is our enemy; and I would
not be peevish, not to be like them.  He is one of the most
inveterate; they list under Sandys,(364) a parcel of them with no
more brains than their general; but being malicious they pass for
ingenious, as in these countries fogs are reckoned warm weather.
Did you ever hear what Earle said of Sandys?  "that he never
laughed but once, and that was when his best friend broke his
thigh."

Last Thursday I wrote you word of our losing the chairman of the
committee.  This winter is to be all ups and downs.  The next day
(Friday) we had a most complete victory.  Mr. Pultney moved for
all papers and letters, etc. between the King and the Queen of
Hungary and their ministers.  Sir R. agreed to give them all the
papers relative to those transactions, only desiring to except
the letters written by the two sovereigns themselves.  They
divided, and we carried it, 237 against 227.  They moved to have
those relations to France, Prussia, and Holland.  Sir R. begged
they would defer asking for those of Prussia till the end of
January, at which time a negotiation would be at an end with that
King, which now he might break off, if he knew it was to be made
public.  Mr. Pultney
persisted; but his obstinacy, which might be so prejudicial to
the public, revolted even his own partisans, and seven of them
spoke against him.  We carried that question by
twenty-four; and another by twenty-one, against sitting on the
next day (Saturday).  Monday and Tuesday we went on the
Westminster election.  Murray (365) spoke divinely; he Was their
counsel.  Lloyd (366) answered him extremely well: but on summing
up the evidence on both sides, and in his reply, Murray was in
short, beyond what was ever heard at the
bar.That day (Tuesday) we went on the merits of the cause, and at
ten at night divided, and lost it.  They had 220, we 216; so that
the election was declared void.  You see four is a fortunate
number to them.  We had forty-one more members in town, who would
not, or could not come down.  The time. is a touchstone for
wavering consciences.  All the arts, money, promises, threats,,
all the arts of the. former year 41, are applied; and
self-interest, in the shape of Scotch
members-nay, and of English ones, operates to the aid of their
party, and to the defeat of ours.  Lord Doneraile,(367) a
young Irishman, brought in by the court, was petitioned
against, though his competitor had but one vote.  This young man
spoke as well as ever any one spoke in his own defence insisted
on the petition being heard, and concluded with
declaring, that, "his cause was his Defence, and Impartiality
must be his support." Do you know that, after this, he went and
engaged if they would withdraw the petition, to vote with them in
the Westminster affair!  His friends reproached him so strongly
with his meanness, that he was shocked, and went to Mr. Pultney
to get off; Mr. P. told him he had given him his honour, and he
would not release him, though Lord Doneraile declared it was
against his conscience: but he voted with
them, and lost us the next question which they put (for
censuring the High Bailiff) by his single vote; for in that the
numbers were 217 against 215: the alteration of his vote would
have made it even; and then the Speaker, I suppose,
would have chosen the merciful side, and decided for us.
After this, Mr. Pultney, with an affected humanity, agreed to
commit the High Bailiff only to the serjeant-at-arms.  Then, by a
majority of six, they voted that the soldiers, who had been sent
for after the poll was closed, to save Lord Sundon's (368) life,
had come in a military and illegal manner, and influenced the
election.  In short, they determined, as Mr. Murray had dictated
to them, that no civil magistrate, on any pretence whatsoever,
though he may not be able to suppress even a riot by the
assistance of the militia and constables, may call in the aid of
the army.  Is not this doing the work of the Jacobites?  have
they any other view than to render the riot act useless? and then
they may rise for the Pretender whenever they please.  Then they
moved to punish Justice
Blackerby for calling in the soldiers; and when it was desired
that he might be heard in his own defence, they said he had
already confessed his crime.  Do but think on it! without
being accused, without knowing, or being told it was a crime, a
man gives evidence in another cause, not his own, and then they
call it his-own accusation of himself, and would condemn him for
it. You see what justice we may expect if they
actually get the majority.  But this was too strong a pill for
one of their own leaders to swallow: Sir John Barnard(369 did
propose and persuade them to give him a day to be heard.  In
short we sat till half an hour after four in the morning; the
longest day that ever was known.  I say nothing of myself, for I
could but just speak when I came away; but Sir Robert was as well
as ever, and spoke with as much spirit as ever, at four o'clock.
This way they will not kill him; I Will not answer for any other.
As he came out, Whitehead,(370) the author of Manners, and agent
with one Carey, a surgeon, for the
Opposition, said "D-n him, how well he looks!"  Immediately after
their success, Lord Gage (371) went forth, and begged there might
be no mobbing; but last night we had bonfires all over the town,
and I suppose shall have notable mobbing at the new election;
though I do not believe there will be any
opposition to their Mr. Edwin and Lord Perceval.(372)  Thank God!
we are now adjourned for three weeks.  I shall go to
Swallowfield (373) for a few days: so for one week you will miss
hearing from me.  We have escaped the Prince'S (374)
affair hitherto, but we shall have it after the holidays.  All
depends upon the practices of both sides in securing or
getting new votes during the recess.  Sir Robert is very
sanguine: I hope, for his sake and for his honour, and for the
nation's peace, that he will get the better: but the moment he
has the majority secure, I shall be very earnest with him to
resign.  He has a constitution to last some years, and enjoy some
repose; and for my own part (and both my brothers agree with me
in it), we wish most heartily to see an end of his ministry.  If
I can judge of them by myself, those who want to be in our
situation, do not wish to see it brought about more than we do.
It is fatiguing to bear so much envy and ill-will
undeservedly.-Otium Divos rogo; but adieu, politics, for three
weeks!

The Duchess of Buckingham, (375) who is more mad with pride than
any merchant's wife in Bedlam, came the other night to the opera
en princesse, literally in robes, red velvet and ermine. I must
tell you a story of her: last week she sent for Cori,(376) to pay
him for her opera-ticket; he was not at
home, but went in an hour afterwards.  She said, "Did he treat
her like a tradeswoman? She would teach him to respect women of
her birth; said he was in league with Mr. Sheffield (377) to
abuse her, and bade him come the next morning at nine."  He came,
and she made him wait till eight at night, only sending him an
omlet and a bottle of wine, "as it was Friday, and he a Catholic,
she supposed he did not eat meat." At last she
received him in all the form of a princess giving audience to an
ambassador. "Now," she said, "she had punished him."

In this age we have some who pretend to impartiality: you will
scarce guess how Lord Brook (378) shows his: he gives one vote on
one side, one on the other, and the third time does not vote at
all, and so on, regularly.

My sister is ,up to the elbows in joy and flowers that she has
received from you this morning and begs I will thank you for her.

You know, or have heard of, Mrs. Nugent, Newsham's mother; she
went the other morning to Lord Chesterfield to beg "he would
encourage Mr. Nugent (379) to speak in the house; for that really
he was so bashful, she was afraid his abilities would be lost on
the world." I don't know who has encouraged him; but so it is,
that this modest Irish converted Catholic does talk a prodigious
deal of nonsense in behalf of English
liberty.

Lord Gage (380) is another; no man would trust him in a wager,
unless he stakes, and yet he is trusted by a whole borough with
their privileges and liberties! He told Mr. Winnington the other
day, that he would bring his son into parliament, that he would
not influence him, but leave him entirely to himself.  "D-n it,"
said Winnington, "so you have all his
lifetime."

Your brother says you accuse him of not writing to you, and that
his reasons are, he has not time, and next, that I tell you all
that can be said.  So I do, I think: tell me when I begin to tire
you, or if I am too circumstantial; but I don't believe you will
think so, for I remember how we used to want such a correspondent
when I was with you.

I have spoke about the young man who is well content to live with
you as a servant out of livery.  I am to settle the
affair finally with his father on Monday, and then he shall set
out as soon as possible.  I will send the things for
Prince Craon etc. by him.  I will write to Madame Grifoni the
moment I hear she is returned from the country.

The Princess Hesse (381) is brought to bed of a son.  We are
going into mourning for the Queen of Sweden;(382) she had
always been apprehensive of the small-pox, which has been very
fatal in her family.

You have heard, I suppose, of the new revolution (383) in
Muscovy.  The letters from Holland to-day say, that they have put
to death the young Czar and his mother, and his father too:
which, if true,(384) is going very far, for he was of a sovereign
house in another country, no subject of Russia, and after the
death of his wife and son, could have no pretence or interest to
raise more commotions there.

We have got a new opera, not so good as the former; and we have
got the famous Bettina to dance, but she is a most
indifferent performer.  The house is excessively full every
Saturday, never on Tuesday: here, you know, we make every
thing a fashion.

I am happy that my fears for Tuscany vanish every letter.  There!
there is a letter of twelve sides! I am forced to page it, it is
SO long, and I have not time to read it over and look for the
mistakes.
Yours, ever.

(363) Antonio Cocchi, a learned physician and author, at
Florence; a particular friend of Mr. Mann.  [The following
favourable character of Dr. Cocchi is contained in a letter from
the Earl of Cork to Mr. Duncombe, dated Florence,
November 29, 1754. "Mr Mann's fortunate in the friendship, skill,
and care of his physician, Dr. Cocchi.  He is a man of most
extensive learning; understands, reads, and speaks all the
European languages; studious, polite, modest, humane, and
instructive.  He is always to be admired and beloved by all who
know him.  Could I live with these two gentlemen only, and
converse with few or none others, I should scarce desire to
return to England for many years."]

(364) Samuel Sandys, a republican, raised on the fall of Sir
R.'W. to be chancellor of the exchequer, then degraded to a peer
and cofferer, and soon afterwards laid aside. [In 1743, he was
raised to the peerage by the title of Lord Sandys,
Baron of Omberley in the county of Worcester, and died in
1770.  Dr. Nash, in his history of that county, states him to
have been "a very useful, diligent senator-a warm, steady
friend-a good neighbor, and a most hospitable country
gentleman and provincial magistrate."]

(365) William Murray, brother of Lord- Stormont, and of Lord
Dunbar, the Pretender's first minister.  He is known by his
eloquence and the friendship of Mr. Pope.  He was soon
afterwards promoted to be solicitor-general. (Afterwards the
celebrated chief-justice of the King's Bench, and Earl of
Man's'field.-D.)

(366) Sir Richard Lloyd, advanced in 1754 to be
solicitor-general, in the room of Mr. Murray, appointed
attorney-general. [And in 1759, appointed one of the Barons of
the exchequer.]

(367) Arthur St. Leger, Lord Doneraile, died in 1750, being lord
of the bedchamber to the Prince of Wales.

(368) Lord Sundon and Sir Charles Wager had been the Court
candidates for Westminster at the late election against
Admiral Vernon and Charles Edwin, Esq.-D.

(369) A great London merchant, and one of the members for the
City.  His reputation for integrity and ability gave him much
weight in the House of Commons.-D. (Lord Chatham, when mr. Pitt,
frequently calls him the Great Commoner.  In 1749, he became
father of the City; when, much against his will, the merchants
erected a statue of him in the Royal Exchange.  He died in 1764.]

(370) Paul Whitehead, an infamous but not despicable poet. [See
ante, p. 190, Letter 42.]

(371) Thomas Lord Viscount Gage had been a Roman Catholic, and
was master of the household to the Prince. [Lord Gage, in
1721, was elected for the borough of Tewksbury; which he
represented till within a few months of his death, in 1754.  He
was a zealous politician, and distinguished himself, in 1732, by
detecting the fraudulent sale of the Derwentwater estates.]

(372) John Perceval, second Earl of Egmont, in Ireland,
created, in 176@, Lord Lovel and Rolland in the peerage of Great
Britain.  He became, in 1747, a lord of the bedchamber to
Frederick Prince of Wales, and in the early part of the reign of
George III. held successively the offices of
postmaster-general and first lord of the admiralty.  He was a man
of some ability and a frequent and fluent speaker, and was the
author of a celebrated party pamphlet of' the day,
entitled "Faction Detected."  His excessive love of ancestry led
him, in Conjunction with his father, and assisted by
Anderson, the genealogist, to print two thick octavo volumes
respecting his family, entitled "History of the House of
Ivery;" a most remarkable monument of human vanity.-D.
[Boswell was not of this opinion.  "Some have affected to
laugh," he says, "at the History of the House of Ivery: it would
be well if many others would transmit their pedigrees to
posterity, with the same accuracy and generous zeal with which
the noble lord who compiled that work has honoured and
perpetuated his ancestry.  Family histories, like the imagines
majorum of the ancients, excite to virtue." See "Life of
Johnson," vol viii. p. 188.]

(373) Swallowfield, in Berkshire, the seat of John Dodd, Esq.

(374) A scheme for obtaining a larger allowance for the Prince of
Wales.

(375) Catherine, Duchess Dowager of Buckingham, natural
daughter of King James II.  (Supposed to be really the
daughter of Colonel Graham, a man of Gallantry of the time, and a
lover of her mother, Lady Dorchester.-D.)  [This
remarkable woman was extravagantly proud of her descent from
James the Second, and affected to be the head of the Jacobite
party in England.  She maintained a kind of royal state, and
affected great devotion to the memory of her father and
grandfather.  On the death of her son, the second Duke of
Buckingham of the Sheffield family (whose funeral was
celebrated in a most extraordinary manner), she applied to the
old Duchess of Marlborough, who was as high spirited as
herself, for the loan of the richly-ornamented hearse which had
conveyed the great duke to his grave. "Tell her," said Sarah, "it
carried the Duke of Marlborough, and shall never carry any one
else."  "My upholsterer," rejoined Catherine of Buckingham in a
fury, "tells me I can have a finer for twenty pounds."-"  This
last stroke," says the editor of the Suffolk Correspondence, "
was aimed at the parsimony of their Graces of Marlborough, which
was supposed to have been visible even in the funeral; but the
sarcasm was as unjust as the original request of borrowing the
hearse was mean and unfeeling."-E.]

(376) Angelo Maria Cori, prompter to the Opera.

(377) Mr. Sheffield, natural son of the late Duke of
Buckingham, with whom she was at law.


(378) Francis, Baron, and afterwards created Earl Brooke.

(379) Robert Nugent, a poet, a patriot, an author, a lord of the
treasury, (and finally an Irish peer by the titles of Lord Clare
and Earl Nugent.  He seems to have passed his long life in
seeking lucrative places and courting rich widows, in both of
which pursuits be was eminently successful.-D.) [He married the
sister and heiress of Secretary Craggs, and his only
daughter married the first Marquis of Buckingham.  A volume of
his ,Odes and Epistles" were published anonymously in 1733.  He
died in 1788.)

(380) Lord Gage was one of those persons to whom the
privileges of parliament were of extreme consequence, as their
own liberties were inseparable from them.

(382) Ulrica, Queen of Sweden, sister of Charles XII.

(383) This relates to the revolution by which the young Czar John
was deposed, and the Princess Elizabeth raised to the throne.

(384) This was not true.  The Princess Anne of Mecklenburgh died
in prison at Riga, a few years afterwards.  Her son, the young
Czar, and her husband, Prince Antony of Brunswick
Wolfenbuttle, were confined for many years.



206 Letter 49
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, Dec. 29, 1741.

I write to YOU two days before the post goes out, because
to-morrow I am to go out of town; but I would answer your
letter by way of Holland, to tell you how much you have
obliged both Sir Robert and me about the Dominichini;(385) and to
beg you to thank Mr. Chute and Mr. Whithed-but I cannot leave it
to you.

"My dear Mr. Chute, was ever any thing so kind!  I crossed the
Giogo (386) with Mr. Coke,(387) but it was in August, and I
thought it then the greatest compliment that ever was paid to
mortal; and I went with him too!  but you to go only for a
picture, and in the month of December: What can I say to you? You
do more to oblige your friend, than I can find terms to thank you
for.  If I was to tell-it here, it would be believed as little as
the rape of poor Tory (388) by a wolf.  I can only say that I
know the Giogo, its snows and its inns, and consequently know the
extent of the obligation that I have to you and Mr. Whithed."

Now I return to you, my dear child: I am really so much
obliged to you and to them, that I know not what to say.  I read
Pennee's letter to Sir.  R., who was much pleased with his
discretion; he will be quite a favourite of mine.  And now we are
longing for the picture; you know, of old, my
impatience.

Your young secretary-servant is looking out for a ship, and will
set out in the first that goes: I envy him.

The Court has been trying but can get nobody to stand for
Westminster.  You know Mr. Doddington has lost himself
extremely by his new turn, after so often changing sides: he is
grown very fat and lethargic; my brother Ned says, "he is grown
of less consequence, but more weight."(389)

One hears of nothing but follies said by the Opposition, who grow
mad on having the least prospect.  Lady Carteret,(390) who, you
know, did not want any new fuel to her absurdity, says, "they
talk every day of making her lord first minister, but he is not
so easily persuaded as they think for."  Good night.
Yours, ever.

(385) A celebrated picture of a Madonna and Child by
Dominichino, in the palace Zembeccari, at Bologna, now in the
collection of the Earl of Orford, at Houghton, in Norfolk.
(Since sent to Russia with the rest of the collection.-D.)

(386) The Giogo is the highest part of the Apennine between
Florence and Bologna.

(387) Son of Lord Lovel, since Earl of Leicester. [In 1744, Lord
Lovel was created Viscount Coke of Holkham and Earl of Leicester.
His only son Edward died before him, in 1753,
without issue; having married Lady Mary, one of the co-heirs of
John Duke of Argyle and Greenwich.]

(388) A black spaniel of Mr. Walpole's was seized by a wolf on
the Alps, as it was running at the head of the chaise-horses, at
noonday. [See ante, p. 139 letter 14.]

(389) George Bubb Dodington had lately resigned his post of one
of the lords of the treasury, and gone again into
opposition.  [In Walpole's copy of the celebrated Diary of this
versatile politician, he had written a "Brief account of George
Bubb Doddington, Lord Melcombe," which the noble editor of the
"Memoires" has inserted.  It describes him, "as his Diary shows,
vain, fickle, ambitious, and corrupt,' and very lethargic; but
gives him credit for great wit and readiness."  Cumberland, in
his Memoirs, thus paints him:-"Dodington,
lolling in his chair, in perfect apathy and self-command,
dozing, and even snoring, at intervals, in his lethargic way,
broke out every now and then into gleams and flashes of wit and
humour."  In 1761, he was created Lord Melcombe, and died in the
following year.]


(390) Frances, daughter of Sir Robert Worseley, and first wife of
John Lord Carteret, afterwards Earl of Granville.



207 Letter 50
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, Jan. 7, 1741-2, O. S.

I must answer for your brother a paragraph that he showed me in
one of your letters: "Mr. W.'s letters are full of wit; don't
they adore him in England?"  Not at all-and I don't
wonder at them: for if I have any wit in my letters, which I do
not at all take for granted, it is ten to one that I have none
out of my letters.  A thousand people can write, that cannot
talk; and besides, you know, (or I conclude so, from the little
one hears stirring,) that numbers of the English have wit, who
don't care to produce it.  Then, as to adoring; YOU now See Only
my letters, and you may be sure I take care not to write you word
of any of my bad qualities, which other people must see in the
gross; and that may be a great
hindrance to their adoration.  Oh! there are a thousand other
reasons I could give you, why I am not the least in fashion.  I
came over in an ill season: it is a million to one that
nobody thinks a declining old minister's son has wit.  At any
time, men in opposition have always most; but now, it would be
absurd for a courtier to have even common sense.  There is not a
Mr. Stuart, or a Mr. Stewart, whose names begin but with the
first letters of Stanhope,(391) that has not a better chance than
I, for being liked.  I can assure you, even those of the same
party would be fools, not to pretend to think me one.  Sir Robert
has showed no partiality for me;(392) and do you think they would
commend where he does not?  even supposing they had no envy,
which by the way, I am far from saying they have not.  Then. my
dear child, I am the coolest man of my party, and if I am ever
warm, it is by contagion; and where violence passes for parts,
what will indifference be called? But how could you think of such
a question '! I don't want money, consequently Do old women pay
me for my wit; I have a very flimsy constitution, consequently
the young women won't taste my wit, and it is a long while before
wit makes its own way in the world; especially, as I never prove
it, by assuring people that I have it by me.  Indeed, if I were
disposed to brag, I could quote two or three half-pay officers,
and an old aunt or two, who laugh prodigiously at every thing I
say; but till they are allowed judges, I will not brag of such
authorities.

If you have a mind to know who is adored and has wit, there is
old Churchill has as much God-d-n-ye wit as ever-except that he
has lost two teeth.  There are half a dozen Scotchmen who vote
against the Court, and are cried up by the Opposition for wit, to
keep them steady.  They are forced to cry up their parts, for it
would be too barefaced to commend their honesty.  Then Mr. Nugent
has had a great deal of wit till within this week; but he is so
busy and so witty, that even his own party grow tired of him.
His plump wife, who talks of nothing else, says he entertained
her all the way on the road with repeating his speeches.

I did not go into the country, last week, as I intended, the
weather was so bad; but I shall go on Sunday for three or four
days, and perhaps shall not be able to write to you that week.
You are in an agitation, I suppose, about politics: both sides
are trafficking deeply for votes during the holidays.  It is
allowed, I think, that we shall have a majority of twenty-six:
Sir R. says more; but now, upon a pinch, he brags like any
bridegroom.

The Westminster election passed without any disturbance, in
favour of Lord Perceive-all (394) and Mr. Perceive-nothing, as my
uncle calls them.  Lord Chesterfield was vaunting to Lord Lovel,
that they should have carried it, if they had set up two
broomsticks. "So I see," replied Lovel.  But it seems we have not
done with it yet: if we get the majority, this will be declared a
void election too, for my Lord Chancellor (395) has found out,
that the person who made the return, had no right to make it: it
was the High Bailiff's clerk, the High Bailiff himself being in
custody of the sergeant-at-arms.  it makes a great noise, and
they talk of making subscriptions for a Petition.

Lord Stafford (396) is come over.  He told me some good
stories of the Primate.(397)

Last night I had a good deal of company to hear Monticelli and
Amorevoli, particularly the three beauty-Fitzroys, Lady
Euston, Lady Conway, and Lady Caroline.(398)  Sir R. liked the
singers extremely: he had not heard them before, I forgot to tell
you all our beauties there was Miss Hervey,(399) my
lord's daughter, a fine, black girl, but as masculine as her
father should be;(400) and jenny Conway, handsomer Still,(401)
though changed with illness, than even the Fitzroys.  I made the
music for my Lord Hervey, who is too ill to go to operas: yet,
with a coffin-face, is as full of his little dirty
politics as ever.  He will not be well enough to go to the House
till the majority is certain somewhere, but lives shut up with my
Lord Chesterfield and Mr. Pultney-a triumvirate, who hate one
another more than any body they could proscribe, had they the
power.  I dropped in at my Lord Hervey's, the other night,
knowing my lady had company: it was soon after our defeats. My
lord, who has always professed particularly to me, turned his
back on me, and retired for an hour into a
whisper with young Hammond,(402) at the end of the room.  Not
being at all amazed at one whose heart I knew so well, I
stayed on, to see more of this behaviour; indeed, to rise
myself to it.  At last he came up to me, and begged this
music. which I gave him, and would often again, to see how many
times I shall be ill and well with him within this month.
Yesterday came news that his brother, Captain William Hervey, has
taken a Caracca ship, worth full two hundred thousand
pounds.  He was afterwards separated from it by a storm, for two
or three days, and was afraid of losing it, having but
five-and-twenty men to thirty-six Spaniards; but he has
brought it home safe.  I forgot to tell you, that upon losing the
first question, Lord Hervey kept away for a week; on our carrying
the next great one, he wrote to Sir Robert, how much he desired
to see him, "not upon any business, but Lord Hervey longs to see
Sir Robert Walpole."

Lady Sundon(402)  is dead, and Lady M- disappointed: she, who is
full as politic as my Lord Hervey, had made herself an
absolute servant to Lady Sundon, but I don't hear that she has
left her even her old clothes.  Lord Sundon is in great grief: I
am surprised, for she has had fits of madness ever since her
ambition met such a check by the death of the Queen.(404)  She
had great power with her, though the Queen pretended to
despise her; but had unluckily told her, or fallen into her power
by some secret.(405)  I was saying to Lady Pomfret, to be sure
she is dead very rich!" She replied, with some warmth, She never
took money."  When I came home, I mentioned this to Sir R.  "No,"
said he, "but she took jewels; Lord Pomfret's place of master of
the horse to the Queen was bought of her for a pair of diamond
earrings, of fourteen hundred pounds value."  One day that she
wore them at a visit at old
Marlboro's, as soon as she was gone, the Duchess said to Lady
Mary Wortley,(406) "How can that woman have the impudence to go
about in that bribe?"-,, Madam," said Lady Mary, "how would you
have people know where wine is to be sold, unless there is a sign
hung out!" Sir R. told me, that in the enthusiasm of her vanity,
Lady Sundon had proposed to him to unite with her, and govern the
kingdom together: he bowed, begged her
patronage, but said he thought nobody fit to govern the
kingdom, but the King and Queen.-Another day.

Friday morning.  I was forced to leave off last night, as I found
it would be impossible to send away this letter finished in any
time.  It will be enormously long, but I have prepared you for
it.  When I consider the beginning of my letter, it looks as if I
were entirely of your opinion about the
agreeableness of them.  I believe you will never commend them
again, when you see how they increase upon your hands.  I have
seen letters of two or three sheets, written from merchants at
Bengal and Canton to their wives: but then they contain the
history of a twelvemonth: I grow voluminous from week to week.  I
can plead in excuse nothing but the true reason; you desired it;
and I remember how I used to wish for such letters, when I was in
Italy.  My Lady Pomfret carries this humanity still farther, and
because people were civil to her in Italy, she makes it a rule to
visit all strangers in general.  She has been to visit a Spanish
Count (407) and his wife, though she cannot open her lips in
their language.  They fled from Spain, he and his brother having
offended the Queen, (408) by their attachments to the Prince of
Asturias; his brother ventured back to bring off this woman, who
was engaged to him.  Lord Harrington (409) has procured them a
pension of six hundred a-year.  They live chiefly with Lord
Carteret and his
daughter,(410) who speak Spanish.  But to proceed from where I
left off last night, like the Princess Dinarzade in the
Arabian Nights, for you will want to know what happened one day.
Sir Robert was at dinner with Lady Sundon, who hated the Bishop
of London, as much as she loved the Church.  "Well," said she to
Sir R., "how does your pope do!"-"Madam," replied he, "he is my
pope, and shall be my Pope; every body has some pope or other;
don't you know that you are one!  They call you Pope Joan."  She
flew into a passion, and desired he would not fix any names on
her; that they were not so easily got rid of.

We had a little ball the other night at Mrs. Boothby's, and by
 dancing, did not perceive an earthquake, which frightened all
the undancing part of the town.

We had a civility from his Royal Highness,(411) who sent for
Monticelli the night he was engaged here, but, on hearing it,
said he would send for him some other night.  If I did not live
so near St. James's, I would find out some politics in
this-should not one?

Sir William Stanhope (412) has had a hint from the same
Highness, that his company is not quite agreeable: whenever he
met any body at Carlton House whom he did not know, he said,
"Your humble servant, Mr. or Mrs. Hamilton."

I have this morning sent aboard the St. Quintin a box for you,
with your secretary-not in it.

Old Weston of Exeter is dead.  Dr. Clarke, the Dean, Dr.
Willes, the decipherer, and Dr. Gilbert of Llandaff, are
candidates to succeed him.(413)  Sir R. is for Willes, who, he
says, knows so many secrets, that he might insist upon being
archbishop.

My dear Mr. Chute! how concerned I am that he took all that
trouble to no purpose.  I will not write to him this post, for as
you show him my letters, this here will sufficiently employ any
one's patience-but I have done.  I long to hear that the
Dominichini is safe.  Good night.
Yours, ever.

(391) The name of Lord Chesterfield.

(392) On the subject of Sir Robert's alleged want of
partiality for his son, the following passage occurs in the
anecdotes prefixed to Lord Wharncliffe's edition of the works of
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu:-"Those ironical lines, where Pope says
that Sir Robert Had never made a friend in private life, And was,
besides, a tyrant to his wife,' are well
understood, as conveying a sly allusion to his good-humoured
unconcern about some things which more strait-laced husbands do
not take so coolly.  In a word, Horace Walpole was
generally supposed to be the son of Carr Lord Hervey, and Sir
Robert not to be ignorant of it.  One striking circumstance was
visible to the naked eye; no beings in human shape could resemble
each other less than the two passing for father and son; and
while their reverse of personal likeness provoked a malicious
whisper, Sir Robert's marked neglect of Horace in his infancy
tended to confirm it.  Sir Robert took scarcely any notice of him
till his proficiency in Eton school, when a lad of some standing,
drew his attention, and proved that, whether he had or had not a
right to the name he went by, he was likely to do it Honour."

inimitably sketched, at about the same period when this letter
was written, by Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, in his poem of',
Isabella, or the Morning:"-

"The General, one of those brave old commanders,
Who served through all our glorious wars in Flanders.
Frank and good-natur'd, of an honest heart,
Loving to act the steady friendly part;
None led through youth a gayer life than he,
Cheerful in converse, smart in repartee;
But with old age, its Vices Come along,
And in narration he's extremely long;
Exact in circumstance, and nice in dates,
He each minute particular relates.
If you name one of marlbro's ten campaigns,
         He gives you its whole history for your pains,
And Blenheim's field becomes by his reciting,
As long in telling as it was in fighting.
His old desire to please is still express'd,
His hat's well cock'd, his periwig's well dress'd.
He rolls his stockings still, white gloves he wears,
And in the boxes with the beaux appears.
His eyes through wrinkled corners cast their rays,
Still he looks cheerful, still soft things he says,
And still remembering that he once was young,
He strains his crippled knees, and struts along."-D.)

(400) The effeminacy of Lord Hervey formed a continual subject
for the satire of his opponents.  Pope's bitter lines on him- are
well remembered.  The old Duchess of Marlborough, too, in her
"Opinions," describes him as having "certainly parts and wit; but
he is the most wretched profligate man that ever was born,
besides ridiculous; a painted face, and not a tooth in his head."
on which the editor of that curious little book, Lord Hailes,
remarks, "Lord Hervey, having felt some attacks of the epilepsy,
entered upon and persisted in a very strict regimen, and thus
stopped the progress and prevented the
effects of that dreadful disease.  His daily food was a small
quantity of asses' milk and a flour biscuit.  Once a week he
indulged himself with eating an apple; he used emetics daily.
Mr. Pope and he were once friends; but they quarrelled, and
persecuted each other with virulent satire.  Pope, knowing the
abstemious regimen which Lord Hervey observed, was so
ungenerous as to call him "mere cheese-curd of asses' milk!" Lord
Hervey used paint to soften his ghastly appearance.  Mr. Pope
must have known this also; and therefore it was
unpardonable in him to introduce it into his "celebrated
portrait." It ought to be remembered, that Lord Hervey is very
differently described by Dr. Middleton; who, in his dedication to
him of "The History of the Life of Tully," praises him for his
strong good sense, patriotism, temperance, and
information.-E.

not likely to attract courtship."]

eventually, on the Princess becoming Queen, exercised an
influence over her, of which even sir Robert Walpole was
jealous.]

however, succeeded in the see of St. David's by Dr. Edward
Willes, Dean of Lincoln and decipherer to the King; and, in the
following year, translated to the bishopric of Bath and Wells.
The art of deciphering, for which Dr. Willes was so celebrated,
has been the subject of many learned and curious works by
Trithemius, Baptista Porta, the Duke Augustus of
Brunswick, and other more recent writers.  The Gentleman's
Magazine for 1742, contains a very ingenious system of
deciphering: but the old modes of secret writing having been, for
the most part, superseded by the modern system of
cryptography, in which, according to a simple rule which may be
communicated verbally, and easily retained in the memory, the
signs for the letters can be changed continually; it is the
chiffre quarr`e or chiffre ind`echiffrable, used, if not
universally, yet by most courts.  None of the old systems of
deciphering are any longer available.]



212 Letter 51
To Sir Horace Mann.
Friday, Jan. 22, 1742.

Don't wonder that I missed writing to you yesterday, my
constant day: you will pity me when you hear that I was shut up
in the House of Commons till one in the morning.  I came away
more dead than alive, and was forced to leave Sir R. at supper
with my brothers: he was all alive and in spirits.(414) He says
he is younger than me, and indeed I think so, in spite of his
forty years more.  My head aches to-night, but we rose early; and
if I don't write to-night when shall I find a
moment to spare?  Now you want to know what we did last night;
stay, I will tell you presently in its place: it was well, and of
infinite consequence-so far I tell you now.  Our recess finished
last Monday, and never at school did I enjoy holidays so
much-but, les voil`a finis jusqu'au printefps! Tuesday (for you
see I write you an absolute journal) we sat on a Scotch election,
a double return; their man was Hume Campbell,(415) Lord
Marchmont's brother, lately made solicitor to the Prince, for
being as troublesome, as violent, and almost as able as his
brother.  They made a great point of it, and gained so many of
our votes, that at ten at night we were forced to give it up
without dividing.  Sandys, who loves persecution, even unto the
death, moved to punish the sheriff; and as we dared not divide,
they ordered him into custody, where by this time, I suppose,
Sandys has eaten him.

On Wednesday, Sir Robert Godschall, the Lord Mayor, presented the
Merchant's petition, signed by three hundred of them, and drawn
up by Leonidas Glover.(416)  This is to be heard next Wednesday.
This gold-chain came into parliament, cried up for his parts, but
proves so dull, one would think he chewed
opium.  Earle says, "I have heard an oyster speak as well
twenty times."

Well, now I come to yesterday: we met, not expecting much
business.  Five of our members were gone to the York election,
and the three Lord Beauclercs (417) to their mother's funeral at
Windsor; for that old beauty St. Albans (418) is dead at last.
On this they depended for getting the majority, and towards three
o'clock, when we thought of breaking up, poured in their most
violent questions: one was a motion for leave to bring in the
Place Bill to limit the number of placemen in the House.  This
was not opposed, because, out of decency, it is generally
suffered to pass the Commons, and is thrown out by the Lords;
only Colonel Cholmondeley (419) desired to know if they designed
to limit the number of those that have promises of places, as
well as of those that have places now.  I must tell you that we
are a very conclave; they buy votes with
reversions of places on the change of the ministry.  Lord Gage
was giving an account in Tom's coffeehouse of the intended
alterations: that Mr. Pultney is to be chancellor of the
exchequer, and Chesterfield and Carteret secretaries of state.
Somebody asked who was to be paymaster?  Numps Edwin,(420) who
stood by, replied, "We have not thought so low as that yet."
Lord Gage harangues every day at Tom's, and has read there a very
false account of the King'S message to the Prince.(421)  The
Court, to show their contempt of Gage, have given their copy to
be read by Swinny.(422)  This is the authentic copy, which they
have made the bishop write from the message which he carried, and
as he and Lord Cholmondeley agree it was
given.

On this Thursday, of which I was telling you, at three
o'clock, Mr. Pultney rose up, and moved for a secret committee of
twenty-one.  This inquisition, this council of ten, was to sit
and examine whatever persons and papers they should
please, and to meet when and where they pleased.  He protested
much on its not being intended against any person, but merely to
give the King advice, and on this foot they fought it till ten at
night, when Lord Perceval blundered out what they had been
cloaking with so @much art, and declared that he should vote for
it as a committee of accusation.  Sir Robert
immediately rose, and protested that he should not have
spoken, but for what he had heard last; but that now, he must
take it to himself.  He portrayed the malice of the
Opposition, who, for twenty years, had not been able to touch
him, and were now reduced to this infamous shift.  He defied them
to accuse him, and only desired that if they should,
might be in an open and fair manner: desired no favour, but to be
acquainted with his accusation.  He spoke of Mr.
Doddington, who had called his administration infamous, as of a
person of great self-mortification, who, for sixteen years, had
condescended to bear part of the odium.  For Mr. Pultney, who had
just spoken a second time, Sir R. said, he had begun the debate
with great calmness, but give him his due, he had made amends for
it in the end.  In short, never was innocence so triumphant.

There were several glorious speeches on both sides: Mr.
Pultney's two, W. Pitt's (423) and George Grenville's,(424) Sir
Robert's, Sir W. Yonge's, Harry Fox's, (425) Mr. Chute's, and the
Attorney-General's.(426)  My friend Coke, for the
first time, spoke vastly well, and mentioned how great Sir
Robert's character is abroad.  ' Sir Francis Dashwood replied,
that he had found quite the reverse from Mr. Coke, and that
foreigners always spoke with contempt of the Chevalier de
Walpole.  That was going too far, and he was called to order, but
got off well enough, by saying, that he knew it was
contrary to rule to name any member, but that he only
mentioned it as spoken by an impertinent Frenchman.

But of all speeches, none ever was so full of wit as Mr.
Pultney's last.  He said, "I have heard this committee
represented as a most dreadful spectre; it has been likened to
all terrible things; it has been likened to the King; to the
inquisition; it will be a committee of safety; it is a
committee of danger; I don't know what it is to be!  One
gentleman, I think, called it a cloud! (this was the Attorney) a
cloud!  I remember Hamlet takes Lord Polonius by the hand and
shows him a cloud, and then asks him if he does not think it is
like a whale." Well, in short, at eleven at night we divided, and
threw                         out this famous committee by 253 to
250, the greatest number that                         ever was in
the house, and the greatest number that ever lost a question.

It was a most shocking sight to see the sick and dead brought in
                      on both sides! Men on crutches, and Sir
William Gordon (427) from his                         bed, with a
blister on his head, and flannel hanging out from under
             his wig.  I could scarce pity him for his
ingratitude.  The day before the Westminster petition, Sir
Charles Wager (428) gave his son a ship, and the next day the
father came down and voted against him.  The son has since been
east away; but they concealed it from the father, that he might
not absent himself.  However, as we have our
good-natured men too on our side, one of his own countrymen went
and told him of it in the House.  The old man, who looked like
Lazarus at his resuscitation, bore it with great
resolution, and said, he knew why he was told of it, but when he
thought his country in danger, he would not go away.  As he is so
near death, that it is indifferent to him whether he died two
thousand years ago or to-morrow, it is unlucky for him not to
have lived when such insensibility would have been a Roman
virtue. (429)

There are no arts, no menaces, which the Opposition do not
practise.  They have threatened one gentleman to have a
reversion cut off from his son, unless he will vote with them.
To Totness there came a letter to the mayor from the Prince, and
signed by two of his lords, to recommend a candidate in
opposition to the solicitor-general.  The mayor sent the
letter to Sir Robert.                       They have turned the
Scotch to the best account.  There is a young Oswald
(430) who had engaged to Sir R. but has voted against us.  Sir R.
sent a friend to reproach him: the moment the gentleman who had
engaged for him came into the room, Oswald said, "You had liked
to have led me into a fine error! did you not tell me that Sir R.
would have the majority?"

When the debate was over, Mr. Pultney owned that he had never
heard so fine a debate on our side; and said to Sir Robert,
"Well, nobody can do what you can!" "Yes," replied Sir R., "Yonge
did better." Mr. P. answered, "It was fine, but not of that
weight with what you said." They all allow it- and now their plan
is to persuade Sir Robert to retire with honour.  All that
evening there was a report about the town, that he and my uncle
were to be sent to the Tower, and people hired windows in the
city to see them pass by-but for this time I believe we shall not
exhibit so historical a parade.

The night of the committee, my brother Walpole
 (431) had got two or three invalids at his house,
designing to carry them into the House by his door, as they were
too ill to go round by Westminster hall: the patriots, who have
rather more contrivances than their predecessors of Grecian and
Roman memory, had taken the precaution of stopping the keyhole
with sand.  How Livy's eloquence would have been hampered, if
there had been back-doors and keyholes to the Temple of Concord!

A few days ago there were lists of the officers at Port Mahon
laid before the House of Lords -. unfortunately, it appeared that
two-thirds of the regiment had been absent.  The Duke of Argyll
said, "Such a list was a libel on the government;" and of all
men, the Duke of Newcastle was the man who rose up and agreed
with him: remember what I have told you once before of his union
with Carteret.  We have
                  carried the York election by a majority of 956.

The other night the Bishop of Canterbury(432) was with Sir
'Robert, and on going away, said, "Sir, I have been lately
reading Thaunus; he mentions a minister, who having long been
persecuted by his enemies, at length vanquished them: the
reason he gives, quia se non
                  deseruit."

Sir Thomas Robinson is at last named to the government of
Barbadoes; he has long prevented its being asked for, by
declaring that he had the promise of it.  Luckily for him, Lord
Lincoln liked his house, and procured him this government on
condition of                   hiring it.

I have mentioned Lord Perceval's speeches; he has a set who have
a rostrum at his house, and harangue there.  A gentleman who came
thither one evening was refused, but insisting that he was
engaged to come, "Oh, Sir," said the porter, "what, are you one
of those who play at members of Parliament?"

I must tell you something, though Mr. Chute will see my
letter.  Sir Robert brought home yesterday to dinner, a fat
comely gentleman, who came up to me, and said he believed I knew
his brother abroad.  I asked his name; he replied, He is with Mr.
Whithed."  I thought he said,   It is Whithed." After I had
talked to him of Mr. Whithed, I said,     There is a very
sensible man with Mr. Whithed,
                  one Mr. Chute." "Sir," said he, "my name is
Chute." "My dear
                  Mr. Chute, now I know both your brothers.  You
will forgive my mistake."

With what little conscience I begin a third sheet! but it
shall be but half a one.  I have received your vast packet of
music by the messenger, for which I thank you a thousand
times; and the political
                  sonnet, which is far from bad.  Who
translated it? I like the translation.

I am obliged to you about the gladiator, etc.: the temptation of
having them at all is great, but too enormous.  If I could have
the gladiator for about an hundred pounds, I would give it.

I enclose one of the bills of lading of the things that I sent
you by your secretary: he sets out tomorrow.  By Oswald's
(433) folly, to whom I entrusted the putting them on board, they
are consigned to Goldsworthy, (434) but pray take care that he
does not open them.  The captain mortifies me by
proposing to stay three weeks at Genoa.  I have sent away
to-night a small additional box of steel wares, which I
received but to-day from Woodstock.  As they are better than the
first, you will choose out some of them for Prince Craon, and
give away the rest as you please.

We have a new opera by Pescetti, but a very bad one; however, all
the town runs after it, for it ends with a charming
dance.(435)  They have flung open the stage to a great length,
and made                 a perfect view of Venice, with the
Rialto, and numbers of gondolas that row about full of masks, who
land and dance.  You would like it.

Well, I have done.  Excuse me if I don't take the trouble to read
it all over again, for it is immense, as you will find.  Good
night!

(414) Sir Robert Wilmot also, in a letter to the Duke of
Devonshire, written on the 12th,
 Sir Robert was today observed to be more naturally gay and full
of spirits than                                    he has been
for some time past."-E.

(415) HUme Campbell was twin brother of Hugh, third Earl of
Marchmont.  They were                              sons of
Alexander, the second earl, who had quarrelled with Sir Robert
Walpole at the                              time of the excise
scheme in 1733.  Sir Robert, in consequence, prevented him from
being                              reelected one of the sixteen
representative Scotch peers in 1734; in requital for which,
                      the old earl's two sons became the
bitterest opponents of the Minister.  They were both
               men of considerable talents; extremely similar in
their characters and dispositions, and
 so much so in their outward
appearance that it was very difficult to know them apart.-D.  The
estimation in which Lord Marchmont was held by his
contemporaries, maybe                              judged of by
the fact, that Lord Cobham gave his bust a place in the Temple of
Worthies,                              at Stowe, and the mention
of him in Pope's inscription in his grotto at
Twickenham;-

"Where British siglis from dying Wyndham stole,
And the bright flame was shot through Marchmont's soul."

We are told by Coxe, that Sir Robert Walpole "used frequently to
rally his sons, who                              were
praising the speeches of Pultney, Pitt, Lyttelton, and others, by
saying, "You may cry up their speeches if you please, but when I
have answered Sir John Barnard and
Lord Polwarth, I think I have concluded the debate."]

conduct their application to parliament on the neglect of
their trade.]

his allowance.  This negotiation was intrusted to Lord
Cholmondeley on the King's, and to Secker, Bishop of Oxford, on
the Prince's side, but came to nothing, [The Prince, in his
answer, stated, that "he could not come to court while Sir Robert
Walpole presided in His Majesty's councils; that he looked on him
as the sole author of our grievances at home, and of our ill
success in the West Indies; and that the
disadvantageous figure we at present made in all the courts of
Europe was to be attributed alone to him."]

(422) Owen MacSwinny, a buffoon; formerly director of the
playhouse. [He had been a manager of Drury Lane Theatre, and was
the author of several dramatic pieces.  He resided in
Italy for several years, and, on his return, was appointed keeper

Other incurables were introduced on their side.  Mr. Hopton, for

replied Vestris, "certainly not; but so much the worse for the
Greeks."-D.



218 Letter 52
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, Feb. 1741-2.

I am miserable that I have not more time to write to you,
especially as you will want to know so much of what I have to
tell you; but for a week or fortnight I shall be so hurried, that
I shall scarce know what I say.  I sit here writing to you, and
receiving all the town, who flock to this house; Sir Robert has
already had three levees this morning, and the
rooms still overflowing-they overflow up to me. You will think
this the prelude to some victory! On the contrary, when you
receive this, there will be no longer a Sir Robert Walpole: you
must know him for the future by the title of Earl of
Orford.  That other envied name expires next week with his
ministry! Preparatory to this change.  I should tell you, that
last week we heard in the House of Commons the Chippenham
election, when Jack Frederick and his brother-in-law, Mr. Hume,
on our side, petitioned against Sir Edmund Thomas and Mr. Baynton
Holt.  Both sides made it the decisive question-but our people
were not all equally true: and upon the previous question we had
but 235 against 236, so lost it by one.  From that time my
brothers, my uncle, I, and some of his particular friends,
persuaded Sir R. to resign.  He was undetermined till Sunday
night.  Tuesday we were to finish the election, when we lost it
by 16; upon which Sir Robert declared to some particular persons
in the House his resolution to retire,(436) and had that morning
sent the Prince of Wales notice of' it.  It is understood from
the heads of the party, that nothing more is to be pursued
against him.  Yesterday (Wednesday) the King adjourned both
Houses for a fortnight, for time to settle
things.  Next week Sir Robert resigns and goes into the House of
Lords.  The only change yet fixed, is, that Lord Wilmington (437)
is to be at the head of the Treasury-but numberless
other alterations and confusions must follow.  The Prince will be
reconciled, and the Whig-patriots will come in.  There were a few
bonfires last night, but they are very unfashionable, for never
was fallen minister so followed.  When he kissed the King's hand
to take his first leave, the King fell on his
neck, wept and kissed him, and begged to see him frequently.  He
will continue in town, and assist the ministry in the
Lords.  Mr. Pelham has declared that he will accept nothing, that
was Sir Robert's; and this moment the Duke of Richmond has been
here from court to tell Sir R. that he had resigned the
mastership of the horse, having received it from him,
unasked, and that he would not keep it beyond his ministry.  This
is the greater honour, as it was so unexpected, and as he had no
personal friendship with the duke.

For myself, I am quite happy to be free from all the fatigue,
envy, and uncertainty of our late situation.  I go every
where; indeed, to have the stare over, and to use myself to
neglect, but I meet nothing but civilities.  Here have been Lord
Hartington, Coke, and poor Fitzwilliam,(438) and others crying:
here has been Lord Deskford (439) and numbers to wish me joy; in
short, it is a most extraordinary and various
scene.(440)

There are three people whom I pity much; the King, Lord
Wilmington, and my own sister; the first, for the affront, to be
forced to part with his minister, and to be forced to
forgive his son; the second, as he is too old, and (even when he
was young,) unfit for the burthen: and the poor girl,(441) who
must be created an earl's daughter, as her birth would deprive
her of the rank.  She must kiss hands, and bear the flirts of
impertinent real quality

I am invited to dinner to-day by Lord Strafford (442) Argyll's
son-in-law.  You see we shall grow the fashion.

My dear child, these are the most material points: I am
sensible how much you must want particulars; but you must be
sensible, too, that just yet, I have not time.

Don't be uneasy; your brother Ned has been here to wish me joy:
your brother Gal. has been here and cried; your tender nature
will at first make you like the latter; but afterwards you will
rejoice with the elder and me.  Adieu! Yours, ever, and the same.

(436) "Sir Robert," says Coxe, "seemed to have anticipated this
event, and met it with his usual fortitude and
cheerfulness.  While the tellers were performing their office, he
beckoned Sir Edward Baynton, the member whose return was
supported by the Opposition, to sit near him., spoke to him with
great complacency, animadverted on the ingratitude of several
individuals who were voting against him, on whom he had conferred
great favour, and declared he would never again sit in that
House."-E.

(437) Sir Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington, knight of the
garter, and at this time lord president of the council.

(438) william, Baron, and afterwards Earl Fitzwilliam; a young
lord, much attached to Sir R. W.

(439) James Ogilvy, Lord Deskford succeeded his father, in 1764,
as sixth Earl of Findlater, and third Earl of Seafield.  He held
some inconsiderable offices in Scotland, and died in 1770.-D.

(440) the peculiar antipathy to Lord Hardwicke manifested by
Horace Walpole on all occasions is founded, no doubt, upon the
opinion which he had taken up, that the resignation of Sir Robert
Walpole at this moment had been rendered necessary by the
treachery and intrigues of that nobleman and the Duke of
Newcastle.  In his "Memoires" he repeatedly charges him with such
treachery; and the Edinburgh reviewer of that work
(xxxvi. 1). 29) favours this view, observing, "It appears
that, unless there was a secret understanding of Newcastle and
Hardwicke with Pulteney and Carteret, before Sir Robert's
determination to resign, the coalition was effected between the
31st of January and 2d of February; for on the 2d of
February it was already settled that Lord Wilmington should be at
the head of the Treasury in the new administration.  So speedy an
adjustment of a point of such consequence looks
somewhat like previous concert."  However much appearances might
favour this opinion, another writer has shown most
satisfactorily that no such previous concert existed.  The
reviewer of the "Memoires" in the Quarterly Review (xxvii. p.
191) proves, in the first place, that it was Sir Robert
himself who determined the course of events, and, as he
emphatically said, turned the key of the closet on Mr.
Pulteney; so that, if he was betrayed, it must have been by
himself; and secondly, that we have the evidence of his family
and friends, that he was lost by his own inactivity and
timidity; in other words, the great minister was worn out with
age and business." And these views are confirmed by extracts from
the "Walpoliana," written, be it remembered, by Philip, second
Earl -of Hardwicke, son of the chancellor, from the information
of the Walpole family, and even of Sir Robert
himself; who, after his retirement, admitted his young friend
into his conversation and confidence-a fact totally
inconsistent with a belief in his father's treachery;-by Sir
Robert's own authority, who, in a private and confidential letter
to the Duke of Devonshire, dated 2d of February, 1742, giving an
account of his resignation, and the efforts of his triumphant
antagonists to form a new ministry, distinctly
states "that he himself prevented the Duke of Newcastle's
dismissal;" and lastly, by Horace Walpole's own pamphlet, "A
Detection of a late Forgery," etc., in which he speaks of "the
breach between the King and the Prince, as open, the known,
avowed cause of the resignation, and which Sir Robert never
disguised;"-and again, among the errors of the writer he
notices, Sir Robert Walpole is made to complain of being
abandoned by his friends.  This is for once an undeserved
satire on mankind: no fallen minister ever experienced such
attachment from his friends as he did."-E.

(441) Maria, natural daughter of Sir R. W. by Maria Skerret, his
mistress, whom he afterwards married.  She had a patent to take
place as an earl's daughter.

(442) William Wentworth, second Earl of Strafford, of the
second creation. He married Anne Campbell, second daughter of
John, Duke of Argyle.-D.



220 Letter 53
To Sir Horace Mann.
Feb. 9, 1741-2.

You will have had my letter that told you of the great change.
The scene is not quite so pleasant as it was, nor the
tranquility arrived that we expected.  All is in confusion; no
overtures from the Prince, who, it must seem, proposes to be
King.  His party have persuaded him not to make up, but on much
greater conditions than he first demanded: in short,
notwithstanding his professions to the Bishop,(443)-he is to
insist on the impeachment of Sir R., saying now, that his
terms not being accepted at first, he is not bound to stick to
them.  He is pushed on to this violence by Argyll,
Chesterfield, Cobham,(444) Sir John Hind Cotton,(445) and Lord
Marchmont.  The first says, "What impudence it is in Sir R. to be
driving about the streets!" and all cry out, that he is still
minister behind the curtain.  They will none of them come into
the ministry, till several are displaced  but have summoned a
great meeting of the faction for Friday, at the Fountain Tavern,
to consult measures against Sir R., and
to-morrow the Common Council meet, to draw up instructions for
their members.  They have sent into Scotland and into the
counties for the same purpose.  Carteret ind Pulteney@ pretend to
be against this violence, but own that if their party
insist upon it, they cannot desert them.  The cry against Sir R.
has been greater this week than ever; first, against a
grant of four thousand pounds a-year, which the King gave him on
his resignation, but which, to quiet them, he has given Up.(446)
Then, upon making his daughter a lady; their wives and daughters
declare against giving her place.  He and she both kissed hands
yesterday, and on Friday go to Richmond for a week.  He seems
quite secure in his innocence-but what
protection is that, against the power and malice of' party!
Indeed, his friends seem as firm is ever, and frequent him as
much; but they are not now the strongest.  As to an
impeachment, I think they will not be so mad as to proceed to it:
it is too solemn and too public to be attempted, without proof of
crimes, of which he certainly is not guilty.  For a bill of'
pains and penalties, they may, if they will, I
believe, pass it through the Commons, but will scarce get the
assent of the King and Lords.  In a week more I shall be able to
write with less uncertainty.

I hate sending you false news, as that was, of the Duke of
Richmond's resignation.  It arose from his being two hours below
with Sir R., and from some very warm discourse of his in the
House of Lords, against the present violences; but went no
further.  Zeal magnified this, as she came up stairs to me, and I
wrote to you before I had seen Sir Robert.

At a time when we ought to be most united, we are in the
greatest confusion; such is the virtue of the patriots, though
they have obtained what they professed alone to seek.  They will
not stir one step in foreign affairs, though Sir R. has offered
to unite with them, with all his friends, for the
common cause.  It will now be seen whether he or they are most
patriot.  You see I call him Sir Robert still! after one has
known him by that name for these threescore years, it is
difficult to accustom one's mouth to another title.

In the midst of all this, we are diverting ourselves as
cordially as if Righteousness and Peace had just been kissing one
another.  Balls, operas, and masquerades! The Duchess of Norfolk
(447) makes a grand masquing next week; and to-morrow there is
one at the Opera-house.

Here is a Saxe-Gothic prince, brother to her Royal
Highness:(448) he sent her word from Dover that he was driven in
there, in his way to Italy.  The man of the inn, Whom he
consulted about lodgings in town, recommended him to one of very
ill-fame in Suffolk-street.  He has got a neutrality for himself,
and goes to both courts.

Churchill (449) asked Pultney the other day, "Well, Mr.
Pultney, will you break me too?"-"No, Charles," replied he, "you
break fast enough of yourself!"  Don't you think it hurt him more
than the other breaking would? Good night!
Yours, ever.

Thursday, Feb. 11, 1741-2.

P. S. I had finished my letter, and unwillingly resolved to send
you all that bad news, rather than leave you ignorant of our
doings; but I have the pleasure of mending your prospect a
little.  Yesterday the Common Council met, and resolved upon
instructions to their members, which, except one not very
descriptive paragraph, contains nothing personal -,against our
new earl; and ends with resolutions "to stand by our present
constitution." Mind what followed! One of them proposed to insert
"the King and Royal Family" before the words, "our
present constitution;" but, on a division, it was rejected by
three to one.

But to-day, for good news! Sir Robert has resigned; Lord
Wilmington is first lord of the treasury, and Sandys has
accepted the seals as chancellor of the exchequer, with Gibbon
(450) and Sir John Rushout,(451) joined to him as other lords of
the treasury.  Waller was to have been the other, but has
formally refused.  So, Lord Sundon, Earle, Treby,(452) and
Clutterbuck (453) are the first discarded, unless the latter
saves himself by Waller's refusal.  Lord Harrington, who is
created an earl, is made president of the council, and Lord
Carteret has consented to be secretary of state in his
room-but mind; not one of them has promised to be against the
prosecution of Sir Robert, though I don't believe now that it
will go on.  You see Pultney is not come in, except in his friend
Sir John Rushout, but is to hold the balance between liberty and
prerogative; at least, in this, he acts with
honour.  They say Sir John Hind Cotton and the Jacobites will be
left out,,unless they bring in Dr. Lee and Sir John Barnard to
the admiralty, as they propose; for I do not think it is decided
what are their principles.  Sir Charles Wager has
resigned this morning:(454) he says, "We shall not die, but be
all changed!"  though he says, a parson lately reading this text
in an old Bible, where the c was rubbed out, read it, not die,
but be all hanged!

To-morrow our earl goes to Richmond Park, en retir`e; comes on
Thursday to take his seat in the Lords, and returns thither
again.  Sandys is very angry at his taking the title of
Orford, which belonged to his wife's (455) great uncle.  You know
a step of that nature cost the great Lord Strafford (456) his
head, at the prosecution of a less bloody-minded man than Sandys.

I remain in town, and have not taken at all to withdrawing, which
I hear has given offence,(457) as well as my gay face in public;
but as I had so little joy in the grandeur, I am
determined to take as little part in the disgrace.  I am
looking about for a new house.

I have received two vast packets from you to-day, I believe from
the bottom of the sea, for they have been so washed that I could
scarce read them.  I could read the terrible history of the
earthquakes at Leghorn: how infinitely good you was to poor Mrs.
Goldsworthy!  How could you think I should not
approve such vast humanity? but you are all humanity and
forgiveness.  I am only concerned that they will be present when
you receive all these disagreeable accounts of your
friends.  Their support" is removed as well as yours.  I only
fear the interest of the Richmonds (458) with the Duke of
Newcastle; but I will try to put you well with Lord Lincoln.  We
must write circumspectly, for our letters now are no longer safe.

I shall see Amorevoli to-night to give him the letter.  Ah!
Monticelli and the Visconti are to sing to-night at a great
assembly at Lady Conway's.  I have not time to write more: so,
good night, my dearest child! be in good spirits.
Yours, most faithfully.

P. S. We have at last got Cr`ebillon's "Sofa:" Lord
Chesterfield received three hundred, and gave them to be sold at
White's.  It is admirable! except the beginning of the
first volume, and the last story, it is equal to any thing he has
written.  How he has painted the most refined nature in Mazulhim!
the most retired nature in Mocles! the man of
fashion, that sets himself above natural sensations, and the man
of sense and devotion, that would skirmish himself from their
influence, are equally justly reduced to the standard of their
own weakness.(459)

(443) Secker, Bishop of Oxford.

(444) Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham, so created in 1717, with
remainder to the issue male of his sister, Hester
Grenville.  He had served in Flanders under the Duke of
Marlborough, and was upon the overthrow of Sir Robert
Walpole's administration promoted to the military rank of
field marshal.  He is now best remembered as the friend of pope
and the creator of the gardens at Stowe.-D.

(445) Sir John Hinde Cotton, Bart. of Landwade, in
Cambridgeshire; long a member of parliament, and one of the
leaders of the Jacobite party.  He died in 1752, and Horace
Walpole, in his Memoires, in noticing this event, says, "Died Sir
John Cotton, the last Jacobite of any sensible
activity."-D.

Lord Carteret and Mr. Pulteney had really betrayed their party,
and so injudiciously, that they lost their old friends and gained
no new ones.

(446) Sir Robert, at the persuasion of his brother, Mr.
Selwyn, and others, desisted from this grant.  Three years
afterwards, when the clamour was at an end, and his affairs
extremely involved, he sued for it; which Mr. Pelham, his
friend and `el`eve, was brought with the worst grace in the world
to ask, and his old obliged master the King prevailed upon, with
as ill grace, to grant. ["February 6. Sir R.
Walpole was presented at Court as Earl of Orford.  He was
persuaded to refuse a grant of four thousand pounds a-year during
the King's life and his own, but could not be dissuaded from
accepting a letter of honour from the King, to grant his natural
daughter Maria, precedence as an earl's daughter; who was also
presented this day.  The same thing had been done for Scrope,
Earl of Sunderland, who left no lawful issue, and from one of
whom Lord Howe is descended."-Secker MS.]

(447) Mary, daughter of Edward Blount, Esq. and wife of
Edward, ninth Duke of Norfolk.-D.

(448) The Princess of Wales.-D.

(449)General Charles Churchill.-D.

(450) Philip Gibbons, Esq.-D.

(451) Sir John Rushout, the fourth baronet of the family, had
particularly distinguished himself as an opponent of Sir R.
Walpole's excise scheme.  He was made treasurer of the navy in
1743, and died in 1775, at the advanced age of ninety-one.  His
son was created Lord Northwick, in 1797.-D.

(452) George Treby, Esq.-D.

(453) Thomas Clutterbuck, Esq.  He left the Treasury in
February 1742, and was made treasurer of the navy.-D.

(454) "February II.  Lord Orford and Sir Charles Wager
resigned.  Mr. Sandys kissed hands as chancellor of the
exchequer: Lord Wilmington declared first commissioner of the
Treasury: offers made to the Duke of Argyle, but refused: none to
Lord Chesterfield."-Secker MS.-E.

(455) Lady Sandys was daughter of Lady Tipping, niece of
Russel, Earl of Orford.

(456) Sir Thomas Wentworth, the great Earl of Strafford, took the
title of Raby from a castle of that name, which belonged to Sir
Henry Vane, who, from that time, became his mortal foe.

(457) Sir Charles Wager. [In the following December Sir
Charles was appointed treasurer of the navy, which office he held
till his death, in May 1743.)

(458) Mrs. Goldsworthy had been a companion of the Duchess of
Richmond.

(459) Posterity has not confirmed the eulogium here given to the
indecent trash of the younger Cr`ebillon: but in the age of
George II. coarseness passed for humour, and obscenity was
wit."-D



224 Letter 54
To Sir Horace Mann.
Feb. 18, 1741-2.

I write to you more tired, and with more headache, than any one
but you could conceive! I came home at five this morning from the
Duchess of Norfolk's masquerade, and was forced to rise before
eleven, for my father, who came from Richmond to take his seat in
the Lords, for the Houses met to-day.  He is gone back to his
retirement.  Things wear a better aspect: at the great meeting
(460) on Friday, at the Fountain, Lord
Carteret and Lord Winchilsea (461) refused to go, only saying,
that they never dined at a tavern.  Pultney and the new
chancellor of the exchequer went, and were abused by his Grace of
Argyll.  The former said he was content with what was
already done, and would not be active in any further
proceedings, though he would not desert the party.  Sandys said
the King had done him the honour to offer him that place; why
should he not accept it? if he had not, another would: if nobody
would, the King would be obliged to employ his old
minister again, which he imagined the gentlemen present would not
wish to see; and protested against screening, with the same
conclusion as Pultney.  The Duke of Bedford was very warm against
Sir William Yonge; Lord Talbot (462) was so in
general.(463)

During the recess, they have employed Fazakerley to draw up four
impeachments; against Sir Robert, my uncle, Mr. Keene, and
Colonel Bladen, who was only commissioner for the tariff at
Antwerp.  One of the articles against Sir R. is, his having at
this conjuncture trusted Lord Waldegrave as ambassador, who is so
near a relation (464) of the Pretender-. but these
impeachments are likely to grow obsolete manuscripts.  The minds
of the people grow more candid: at first, they made one of the
actors at Drury Lane repeat some applicable lines at the end of
Harry the Fourth; but last Monday, when his Royal Highness-, had
purposely bespoken "The Unhappy Favourite" (465) for Mrs.
Porter's benefit, they never once applied the most glaring
passages; as where they read the indictment against Robert Earl
of Essex, etc.  The Tories declare against further prosecution-if
Tories there are, for now one hears of nothing but the Broad
Bottom: it is the reigning cant word, and means, the taking all
parties and people, indifferently into the
ministry.  The Whigs are the dupes of this; And those in the
Opposition affirm that Tories no longer exist.
Notwithstanding this, they will not come into the new
ministry, unless what were always reckoned Tories are
admitted.  The Treasury has gone a-begging: I mean one of the
lordships, which is at last filled up with Major Compton, a
relation of Lord Wilmington; but now we shall see a new scene.
On Tuesday night Mr. Pultney went to the Prince, and, without the
knowledge of Argyll, etc., prevailed on him to write to the King:
he was so long determining, that it was eleven at night before
the King received his letter.  Yesterday morning the prince,
attended by two of his lords, two grooms of the Bedchamber, and
Lord Scarborough,(466) his treasurer went to the King's
levee.(467) The King said, "How does the Princess do?  I hope she
is well."  The Prince kissed his hand, and this was all!  The
Prince returned to Carlton House, whither crowds went to him.  He
spoke to the Duke of Newcastle and Mr. Pelham; but would not to
the three dukes, Richmond, Grafton, and Marlborough.(468)  At
night the Royal Family were all at the Duchess of Norfolk'@' and
the streets were illuminated and bonfired.  To-day, the Duke of
Bedford, Lord Halifax, and some others, were at St. James's: the
King spoke to all the Lords.  In a day or two, I shall go with my
uncle and brothers to the Prince's levee.

Yesterday there was a meeting of all the Scotch of our side, who,
to a man, determined to defend Sir Robert

Lyttelton (469) is going to marry Miss Fortescue, Lord
Clinton's sister.

When our earl went to the House of lords to-day, he
apprehended some incivilities from his Grace of Argyll, but he
was not there.  Bedford, Halifax, Berkshire,(470) and some more,
were close by him, but would not bow to him.  Lord
Chesterfield wished him joy.  This is all I know for certain; for
I will not send you the thousand lies of every new day.

I must tell you how fine the masquerade of last night was.  There
were five hundred persons, in the greatest variety of handsome
and rich dresses I ever saw, and all the jewels of London-and
London has some! There were dozens of ugly Queens of Scots, of
which I will only name to you the eldest Miss Shadwell!  The
Princess of Wales was one, covered with
diamonds, but did not take off her mask: none of the Royalties
did, but every body else.  Lady Conway (471) was a charming Mary
Stuart: Lord and Lady Euston, man and woman huzzars.  But the two
finest and most charming masks were their Graces of
Richmond,(472) like Harry the Eighth and Jane Seymour:
excessively rich, and both so handsome @ Here is a nephew of the
King of Denmark, who was in armour, and his governor, a most
admirable Quixote.  there were quantities of Vandykes, and all
kinds of old pictures walked out of the frames.  It was an
assemblage of all ages and nations, and would look like the day
of judgment, if tradition did not persuade us that we are all to
meet naked, and if something else did not tell us that we shall
not meet with quite so much indifference, nor thinking quite so
much of the becoming.  My dress was an
Aurungzebe: but of all extravagant figures commend me to our
friend the Countess!(473)  She and my lord trudged in like
pilgrims with vast staffs in their hands; and she was so
heated, that you would have thought her pilgrimage had been, like
Pantagruel's voyage, to the Oracle of the Bottle! Lady Sophia was
in a Spanish dress-so was Lord Lincoln; not, to be sure, by
design, but so it happened.  When the King came in, the Faussans
(474) were there, and danced an entr`ee.  At the masquerade the
King sat by Mrs. Selwyn, and with tears told her, that "the Whigs
should find he loved them, as he had the poor man that was gone!"
He had sworn that he would not speak to the Prince at their
meeting, but was prevailed on.

I received your letter by Holland, and the paper about the
Spaniards.  By this time you will conceive that I can speak of
nothing to any purpose, for Sir R. does not meddle in the
least with business.

As to the Sibyl, I have not mentioned it to him; I still am for
the other.  Except that, he will not care, I believe, to buy more
pictures, having now so many more than he has room for at
Houghton; and he will have but a small house in town when we
leave this.  But you must thank the dear Chutes for their new
offers; the obligations are too great, but I am most sensible to
their goodness, and, were I not so excessively tired now, would
write to them.  I cannot add a word more, but to think of the
Princess:(475) "Comment! vous avez donc des enfans!" You see how
nature sometimes breaks out in spite of religion and prudery,
grandeur and pride, delicacy and
`epuisements!  Good night!
Yours ever.

Detected." [To this meeting at the Fountain tavern Sir Charles
Hanbury Williams alludes in his Ode against the Earl of Bath,
called the Statesman-

Say, how he harangued at the Fountain;
Say, how the old patriots were bit,
And a mouse was produced by a mountain."]

the Fountain tavern of above two hundred commoners and
thirty-five Lords.  Duke of Argyle spoke warmly for
prosecuting Lord Orford, with hints of reflection on those who

cleansing the Augean stable of the dung and grooms.  Mr. Sandys
and Mr. Gibbon there.  Lord Carteret and Lord
Winchilsea not.  Lord Chancellor, in the evening, in private
discourse to me, strong against taking in any Tories: owning no
more than that some of them, perhaps, were not for the
Pretender, or, at least, did not know they were for him;
though, when I gave him the account first of my discourse with
the Prince, he said, the main body of them were of the same
principles with the Tories."-E.

Essex," was first acted in 1682.  The prologue and epilogue were
written by Dryden.  Speaking of this play, in the Tatler, Sir
Richard Steele says, "there is in it not one good line, and yet
it is a play which was never seen without drawing
tears from some part of the audience; a remarkable instance, that
the soul is not to be moved by words, but things; for the
incidents in the drama are laid together so happily that the
spectator makes the play for himself, by the force with which the
circumstance has upon his imagination."-E.

227 Letter 55
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, Feb. 25, 1742.

I am impatient to hear that you have received my first account of
the change; as to be sure you are now for every post.  This last
week has not produced many new events.  The Prince of Wales has
got the measles,(476) so there has been but little incense
offered up to him: his brother of Saxe-Gotha has got them too.
When the Princess went to St. James's, she fell at the King's
feet and struggled to kiss his hand, and burst into tears.  At
the Norfolk masquerade she was vastly bejewelled; Frankz had lent
her forty thousand pounds worth, and refused to be paid for the
hire, only desiring that she would tell whose they were.  All
this is nothing, but to introduce one of Madame de Pomfret's
ingenuities, who. being dressed like a pilgrim, told the
Princess, that she had taken her for the Lady of Loreto.

But you will wish for politics now, more than for histories of
masquerades, though this last has taken up people's thoughts full
as much.  The House met last Thursday and voted the army without
a division: Shippen (477 alone, unchanged, Opposed it.  They have
since been busied on elections, turning out our
friends and voting in their own.. almost without opposition.  The
chief affair has been the Denbighshire election, on the petition
of Sir Watkyn William . 'They have voted him into parliament and
the high-sheriff into Newgate.  Murray (478) was most eloquent:
Lloyd,(479) the counsel on the other side, and no bad one, (for I
go constantly, though I do not stay long, but "leave the dead to
bury their dead," said that it was objected to the sheriff, that
he was related to the
sitting member; but, indeed, in that country (Wales) it would be
difficult not to be related.  Yesterday we had another
hearing of the petition of the Merchants, when Sir Robert
Godschall shone brighter than even his usual.  There was a copy
of a letter produced, the original having been lost: he asked
whether the copy had been taken before the original was lost, or
after!

Next week they commence their prosecutions, which they will
introduce by voting a committee to inquire into all the
offices: Sir William Yonge is to be added to the impeachments,
but the chief whom they wish to punish is my uncle.(480) He is
the more to be pitied, because nobody will pity him.  They are
not fond of a formal message which the States General have sent
to Sir Robert, "to compliment him on his new honour, and to
condole with him on being out of the ministry, which will be so
detrimental to Europe!

The third augmentation in Holland is confirmed, and that the
Prince of Hesse is chosen generallissimo, which makes it
believed that his Grace of Argyll will not go over, but that we
shall certainly have a war with France in the spring.
Argyll has got the Ordnance restored to him, and they wanted to
give him his regiment; to which Lord Hertford (481) was desired
to resign it, with the offer of his old troop again.  He said he
had received the regiment from the King; if his Majesty pleased
to take it back, he might, but he did not know why he should
resign it.  Since that, he wrote a letter to the King, and sent
it by his son, Lord Beauchamp, resigning his regiment, his
government, and his wife's pension, as lady of the bedchamber to
the late Queen.

No more changes are made yet.  They have offered the Admiralty to
Sir Charles Wager again, but he refused it: he said, he heard
that he was an old woman, and that he did not know what good old
women could do any where.

A comet has appeared here for two nights, which, you know, is
lucky enough at this time and a pretty ingredient for making
prophecies.

These are all the news.  I receive your letters regularly, and
hope you receive mine so: I never miss one week.  Adieu! my
dearest child! I am perfectly well; tell me always that you are.
Are the good Chutes still at Florence? My best love to them, and
services to all.

Here are some new Lines much in vogue:(482)

                                   1741.

Unhappy England, still in forty-one (483)
By Scotland art thou doom'd to be undone!
But Scotland now, to strike alone afraid,
Calls in her worthy sister Cornwall's (484) aid;
And these two common Strumpets, hand in hand,
Walk forth, and preach up virtue through the land;
Start at corruption, at a bribe turn pale,
Shudder at pensions, and at placemen rail.
Peace, peace! ye wretched hypocrites; or rather
With Job, say to Corruption, " Thou'rt our Father."

But how will Walpole justify his fate?
He trusted Islay (485) till it was too late.
Where were those parts! where was that piercing mind!
That judgment, and that knowledge of mankind!
To trust a Traitor that he knew so well!
(Strange truth! I)ctray'd, but not deceived, he fell!)
He knew his heart was, like his aspect, vile;
Knew him the tool, and Brother of Argyll!
Yet to his hands his power and hopes gave up;
And though he saw 'twas poison, drank the cup!
Trusted to one he never could think true,
And perish'd by a villain that he knew.

(476) "February 21.  Prince taken ill of the measles.  The King
sent no message to him in his illnesses Secker MS.-E.

(477) William Shippen, a celebrated Jacobite.  Sir R. Walpole
said that he was the Only man whose price he did not know. [See
ante, p. 194, Letter 45.]

             (478)  William Murray, Mr. Pope's friend,
afterwards Solicitor, and then Attorney-general.

(479) Sir Richard Lloyd, who succeeded Mr. Murray, in 1754, as
Solicitor-general.

(480) Horace Walpole, brother of Sir Robert.

(481) Algernon Seymour, Earl of Hertford, eldest son of
Charles, called the proud Duke of Somerset, whom he succeeded in
that Title, and was the last Duke of Somerset of that
branch; his son, who is here mentioned, having died before
him.-D.

(482) These Lines were written by Sir Charles Hanbury
Williams. [And are published in the edition of his works, in
three volumes, 12 no.1.

(483) Alluding to the Grand Rebellion against Charles the
First.

(484) The Parliament which overthrew Sir R. W. was carried
against him by his losing the majority of the Scotch and
Cornish boroughs; the latter managed by Lord Falmouth
                           and Thomas Pitt.

(485) Archibald Campbell, Earl of Islay, brother of John, Duke of
Argyll, in conjunction with whom (though then openly at variance)
he was supposed to have betrayed Sir R.
                           W. and to have let the Opposition
succeed in the Scotch elections, which were trusted to
                           his management.  It must be
observed, that Sir R. W. would never allow that he believed
                    himself betrayed by Lord Islay.



229 Letter 56
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, March 3d, 1742.

I am Obliged to write to you to-day, for I am sure I shall not
have a moment to-morrow; they are to make their motion for a
secret committee to examine into the late administration.  We are
to oppose it strongly, but to no purpose; for since the change,
they have beat us on no division under a majority of forty.  This
last week has produced no new novelties; his
Royal Highness has been shut up with the measles, of which he was
near dying, by eating China oranges.

We are to send sixteen thousand men into Flanders in the
spring, under his Grace of Argyll; they talk of the Duke of
Marlborough and Lord Albemarle to command under him.  Lord
Cadogan (486) is just dead, so there is another regiment
vacant: they design Lord Delawar's for Westmoreland;(487) so now
Sir Francis Dashwood (488) will grow as fond of the King again as
he used to be-or as he has hated him since.

We have at last finished the Merchants' petition, under the
conduct of the Lord Mayor and Mr. Leonidas;(489) the greatest
coxcomb and the greatest oaf that ever met in blank verse or
prose.  I told you the former's question about the copy of a
letter taken after the original was lost.  They have got a new
story of him; that hearing of a gentleman who had had the
small-pox twice and died of it, he asked, if he died the first
time or the second-if this is made for him, it is at least quite
in his style.  After summing up the evidence (in doing which, Mr.
Glover literally drank several times to the Lord Mayor in a glass
of water that stood by him,) Sir John Barnard moved to vote, that
there had been great neglect in the
protection of the trade, to the great advantage of' the enemy,
and the dishonour of the nation.  He said he did not mean to
charge the Admiralty particularly, for then particular persons
must have had particular days assigned to be heard in their own
defence, which would take up too much time, as we are now going
to make inquiries of a much higher nature.  Mr. Pelham was for
leaving out the last words.  Mr. Doddington rose, and in a set
speech declared that the motion was levelled at a particular
person, who had so usurped all authority, that all inferior
offices were obliged to submit to his will, and so either bend
and bow, or be broken: but that he hoped the steps we were now
going to take, would make the office of first
minister so dangerous a post, that nobody would care to accept it
for the future.  Do but think of this fellow, who has so lost all
character, and made himself so odious to both King, and Prince,
by his alternate flatteries, changes, oppositions, and changes of
flatteries and oppositions, that he can never expect what he has
so much courted by all methods,-think of his talking of making it
dangerous for any one else to accept the first ministership!
Should such a period ever arrive, he would accept it with joy-the
only chance he can ever have for it! But sure, never was
impudence more put to shame! The whole debate turned upon him.
Lord Doneraile (490) (who, by the way, has produced blossoms of
Doddington like fruit, and
consequently is the fitter scourge for him) stood up and said, he
did not know what that gentleman meant; that he himself was as
willing to bring all offenders to justice as any man; but that he
did not intend to confine punishment to those who had been
employed only at the end of the last ministry, but
proposed to extend it to all who had been engaged in it, and
wished that that gentleman would speak with more lenity of an
administration, in which he himself had been concerned for so
many years.  Winnington said, he did not know what Mr.
Doddington had meant, by either bending or being broken; that he
knew some who had been broken, though they had bowed an bended.
Waller defended Doddington, and said, if he was
gilty, at least Mr. Winnington was so too; on which Fox rose up,
and, laying his hand on his breast, said, he never wished to have
such a friend, as could only excuse him by bringing in another
for equal share of his guilt.  Sir John Cotton
replied; he did not wonder that Mr. Fox (who had spoken with
great warmth) was angry at hearing his friend in place,
compared to one out of place.  Do but figure how Doddington must
have looked and felt during such dialogues!  In short, it ended
in Mr. Pultney's rising, and saying, he could not be against the
latter words, as he thought the former part of the motion had
been proved . and wished both parties would join in carrying on
the war vigorously, or in procuring a good peace, rather than in
ripping open old sores, and continuing the
heats and violences of parties.  We came to no division-for we
should have lost it by too many.

Thursday evening.

I had written all the former part of my letter, only reserving
room to tell you, that they had carried the secret
committee-but it is put off till next Tuesday.  To-day we had
nothing but the giving up the Heydon election, when Mr.
Ppultney had an opportunity (as Mr. Chute and Mr. Robinson would
not take the trouble to defend a cause which they could not
carry) to declaim upon corruption: had it come to a trial, there
were eighteen witnesses ready to swear positive bribery against
Mr. Pultney.  I would write to Mr. Chute, and thank him for his
letter which you sent me, but I am so out of
humour at his brother's losing his seat, that I cannot speak
civilly even to him to-day.

It is said, that my Lord's Grace of Argyll has carried his great
point of the Broad Bottom-as I suppose you will hear by
rejoicings from Rome.  The new Admiralty is named; at the head is
to be Lord Winchilsea, with Lord Granard,(491) Mr.
Cockburn, his Grace's friend, Dr. Lee, the chairman, Lord Vere
Beauclerc;(492) one of the old set, by the interest of the Duke
of Dorset, and the connexion of Lady Betty Germain, whose niece
Lord Vere married; and two Tories, Sir John Hind Cotton and Will.
Chetwynd,(493) an agent of Bolingbroke's-all this is not declared
yet, but is believed.

This great Duke has named his four aid-de-camps-Lord Charles Hay;
George Stanhope, brother of Earl Stanhope; Dick
Lyttelton, who Was page; and a Campbell.  Lord Cadogan is not
dead, but has been given over.

We are rejoicing over the great success of the Queen of
Hungary's arms, and the number of blows and thwarts which the
French have received.  It is a prosperous season for our new
popular generals to grow glorious!

But, to have done with politics.  Old Marlborough has at last
published her Memoirs; they are digested by one Hooke, (494) who
wrote a Roman history; but from her materials which are so
womanish, that I am sure the man might sooner have made a gown
and petticoat with them.  There are some choice letters from
Queen Anne, little inferior in the fulsome to those from King
James to the Duke of Buckingham.

Lord Oxford's (495) famous sale begins next Monday, where
there is as much rubbish of another kind as in her grace's
history.  Feather bonnets presented by the Americans to Queen
Elizabeth; elks'-horns -cups; true copies converted into
candle of original pictures that never existed; presents to
himself from the Royal Society, etc. particularly forty
volumes of prints of illustrious English personages; which
collection is collected from frontispieces to godly books, bibles
and head-pieces and tail-pieces to Waller's works;
views of King Charles's sufferings; tops of ballads;
particularly earthly crowns for heavenly ones, and streams of
glory.  There are few good pictures.  for the miniatures are not
to be sold, nor the manuscripts , the books not till next year.
There are a few fine bronzes, and a very fine
collection of English coins.

We have got another opera,(496) which is liked.  There was to
have been a vast elephant, but the just directors, designing to
give the audience the full weight of one for their money, made it
so heavy that at the prova it broke through the stage.  It was to
have carried twenty soldiers, with Monticelli on a throne in the
middle.  There is a new subscription begun for next year, thirty
subscribers at two hundred pounds each.  Would you believe that I
am one? You need not believe it
quite, for I am but half an one; Mr. Conway and I take a share
between us.  We keep Monticelli and Amorevoli, and to please Lord
Middlesex, that odious Muscovita; but shall discard Mr. Vaneschi.
We are to have the Barberina and the two Faussans; so, at least,
the singers and dancers will be equal to any thing in Europe.

Our earl is still at Richmond: I have not been there yet; I shall
go once or twice; for however little inclination I have to it, I
would not be thought to grow cool just now.  You know I am above
such dirtiness, and you are sensible that my
coolness is of much longer standing.  Your sister is with mine at
the Park; they came to town last Tuesday for the
opera, and returned next day.  After supper, I prevailed on your
sister (497) to sing, and though I had heard her before, I
thought I never heard any thing beyond it; there is a
sweetness in her voice equal to Cuzzoni's, with a better
manner.                                '

I was last week at the masquerade, dressed like an old woman, and
passed for a good mask.  I took the English liberty of teasing
whomever I pleased, particularly old Churchill.  I told him I was
quite ashamed. of being there till I met him, but was quite
comforted with finding one person in the room older than myself.
The Duke,(498) who had been told who I was, came up and said, "Je
connois cette poitrine." I took him for some Templar, and
replied, "Vous! vous ne connoissez que des poitrines qui sont
bien plus us`ees." It was unluckily pat.  The next night, at the
drawing-room, he asked me, very good-humouredly, if I knew who
was the old woman that had
teased every body at the masquerade.  We were laughing so much at
this, that the King crossed the room to Lady Hervey, who was with
us, and said, "What are those boys laughing at set" She told him,
and that I had said I was so awkward at
undressing myself, that I had stood for an hour in my stays and
under-petticoat before my footman.  My thanks to Madame Grifoni.
I cannot write more now, as I must not make my
letter too big, when it appears at the secretary's office
nouc.  As to my sister, I am sure Sir Robert would never have
accepted Prince Craon's offer, who now, I suppose, would not be
eager to repeat it.

(486) Charles, Lord Cadogan, of Oakley, to which title he
succeeded on the death of his elder brother, William, Earl
Cadogan, who was one of the most distinguished "of
Marlborough's captains." Charles, Lord Cadogan, did not die at
the period when this letter was written.  On the contrary, he
lived, till the year 1776.-D.

(487) John, seventh Earl of Westmoreland.  He built the
Palladian Villa of Mereworth, in Kent, which is a nearly   exact
copy of the celebrated Villa Capra, near Vicenza.  He died in
1762.  Sir Francis Dashwood succeeded, on his decease, to the
barony in fee of Le Despencer.-D.

(488) Sir Francis Dashwood, nephew to the Earl of
Westmoreland, had gone violently into Opposition, on that
lord's losing his regiment.

(489) Mr. Glover. (Walpole always depreciates Glover; but his
conduct, upon the occasion referred to in the text, displayed
considerable ability.-D.) [His speech upon this occasion was
afterwards published in a pamphlet, entitled, ,A short Account of
the late Application to Parliament, made by the Merchants of
London, upon the Neglect of their Trade; with the Substance
thereof, as summed up by Mr. Glover.,,]

(490) Arthur Mohun St. Leger, third Viscount Doneraile, in
Ireland, of the first creation.
                 He was at this time member for Winchilsea, was
appointed a lord of the bedchamber to Frederick Prince of Wales
in 1747, and died at Lisbon in 1749.-D.

(491) George Forbes, third Earl of Granard in Ireland; an
admiral, and a member of the House of Commons.-D.

(492) Third son of the first Duke of St. Albans, created in 1750
Lord Vere of Hanworth in Middlesex.  He was the direct ancestor
of the present line of the St. Albans family.  His wife was Mary,
daughter and heiress of Thomas Chambers, Esq. of Hanworth, by
Lady Mary Berkeley, the sister of lady Betty Germain.-D.

(493) William Richard Chetwynd    'second brother of the first
viscount of that name; member of parliament successively for
Stafford and Plymouth.  He had been envoy at Genoa, and a lord of
the Admiralty; and he finally succeeded his two elder
brothers as third Viscount Chetwynd, in 1767.-D. [He was
familiarly called "Black Will," and sometimes "Oroonoka
Chetwynd," from his dark complexion.  He died in 1770.]

(494) Nathaniel Hooke, a laborious compiler, but a very bad
writer.  It is said, that the Duchess of Marlborough gave him
5000 pounds for the services he rendered her, in the
composition and publication of her apology.  She, however,
afterwards quarrelled with him, because she said he tried to
convert her to Popery.  Hooke was himself of that religion, and
was also a Quietist, and an enthusiastic follower of
Fenelon.  It was Hooke who brought a Catholic priest to attend
the deathbed of Pope; a proceeding which excited such bitter
inclination in the infidel Bolingbroke.  Hooke died July 19,
1763. [When Hooke asked Pope, "whether he should not send for a
priest, the dying    poet replied, "I do not suppose that is
essential, but it will look right."-Spence, p. 322.)

(495) Edward second Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, only son of
the minister, he was a great and liberal patron of
literature and learned men, and completed the valuable
collection of manuscripts commenced by his father, which is now
in the British Museum. He married the great Cavendish
heiress, Lady Henrietta Cavendish Holles, daughter of Holles,
Duke of Newcastle, and died June 16, 1741.-D.

234 Letter 57
To Sir Horace Mann.
March 10, 1742.

I will not work you up into a fright only to have the pleasure of
putting you out of it, but will tell you at once that we have
gained the greatest victory! I don't mean in the person of
Admiral Vernon, nor of Admiral Haddock; no. nor in that of his
Grace of Argyll.  By we, I don't mean we; England, but we,
literally we; not you and I, but we, the House of Orford.  The
certainty that the Opposition (or rather the Coalition, for that
is the new name they have taken) had of carrying every point they
wished, made them, in the pride of their hearts, declare that
they would move for the Secret Committee
yesterday (Tuesday), and next Friday would name the list, by
which day they should have Mr. Sandys from his reelection.  It
was, however, expected to be put off, as Mr. Pultney could not
attend the House, his only daughter was dying-they say she is
dead.(499) But an affair of consequence to them, and indeed to
the nation in general, roused all their rage, and drove them to
determine on the last violences.  I told you in my last, that the
new Admiralty was named, with a mixture of Tories; that is, it
was named by my Lord of Argyll; but the King
flatly put his negative on Sir John Cotton.  They said he was no
Tory now, (and, in truth, he yesterday in the House
professed himself a Whig,) and that there were no Tories left in
the nation.  The King replied, "that might be; but he was
determined to stand by those who had set him and his family upon
the throne." This refusal enraged them so much, that they
declared they would force him, not only to turn out all the old
ministry, but the new too, if he wished to save Sir R. and others
of his friends; and that, as they supposed he designed to get the
great bills passed, and then prorogue the
Parliament, they were determined to keep back some of the
chief bills, and sit all the summer, examining into the late
administration.  Accordingly, yesterday, in a most full house,
Lord Limerick (500) (who, last year, seconded the famous
motion )501)) moved for a committee to examine into the
conduct of the last twenty years, and was seconded by Sir John
St. Aubin.(502)  In short, (for I have not time to tell you the
debate at length,) we divided, between eight and nine, when there
was not a man of our party that did not expect to lose it by at
least fifteen or twenty, but, to our great
amazement, and their as great confusion, we threw out the
motion, by a majority of 244 against 242.(503) Was there ever a
more surprising event! a disgraced minister, by his personal
interest, to have a majority to defend him even from inquiry!
What was ridiculous, the very man who seconded the motion
happened to be shut out at the division; but there was one on our
side shut out too.

I don't know what violent step they will take next; it must be by
surprise, for when they could not carry this, it will be
impossible for them to carry any thing more personal.  We
trust that the danger is now past, though they had a great
meeting to-day at Doddington 'S,(504) and threaten still.  He was
to have made the motion, but was deterred by the treatment he met
last week.  Sir John Norris was not present; he has resigned all
his employments, in a pique for not being named of the new
Admiralty.  His old Grace of Somerset (505) is
reconciled to his son, Lord Hertford, on his late affair of
having the regiment taken from him: he sent for him, and told him
he had behaved like his son.

My dearest child, I have this moment received a most
unexpected and most melancholy letter from you, with an
account of your fever and new operation.  I did not in the least
dream of your having any more trouble from that
disorder! are YOU never to be delivered from it? Your letter has
shocked me extremely; and then I am terrified at the
Spaniards passing so near Florence.  If they should, as I fear
they will, stay there, how inconvenient and terrible it would be
for you, now you are ill! You tell me, and my good Mr.
Chute tells me, that you are out of all danger, and much
better; but to what can I trust, when you have these continual
relapses? The vast time that passes between your writing and my
receiving your letters, makes me flatter myself, that by now you
are out of all pain: but I am miserable, with finding that you
may be still subject to new torture!  not all your courage, which
is amazing can give me any about you.  But how can you write to
me? I will not suffer it-and now, good Mr. Chute will write for
you.  I am so angry at your writing
immediately after that dreadful operation, though I see your
goodness in it, that I will not say a word more to you.  All the
rest is to Mr. Chute.

What shall I say to you, my dearest Sir, for all your
tenderness to poor Mr. Mann and me? as you have so much
friendship for him, you may conceive how much I am obliged to
you.  How much do I regret not having had more opportunities of
showing you my esteem and love, before this new attention, to Mr.
Mann.  You do flatter me, and tell me he is
recovering--nay I trust you? and don't you say it, only to
comfort me?-Say a great deal for me to Mr. Whithed; he is
excessively good to me; I don't know how to thank him.  I am
happy that you are so well yourself, and so constant to your
fasting.  To reward your virtues, I will tell you the news I
know; not much, but very extraordinary.  What would be the most
extraordinary event that you think could happen? Would not-next
to his becoming a real patriot-the Duke of Argyll's resigning be
the most unexpected?  would any thing be more surprising than his
immediately resigning power at having felt the want of them? Be
that as it will, he literally, actually, resigned all his new
commissions yesterday, because the King refused to employ the
Tories.(506)  What part he will act next is yet to come.  Mrs.
Boothby said, upon the occasion, "that in one month's time he had
contrived to please the whole
nation-the Tories, by going to court; the Whigs, by leaving it."

They talk much of impeaching my father, since they could not
committee him; but as they could not, I think they will scarce be
able to carry a more violent step.  However, to show how little
Tory resentments are feared, the King has named a new Admiralty;
Lord Winchilsea, Admiral Cavendish, Mr. Cockburn, Dr. Lee, Lord
Baltimore, young Trevor,(507) (which is much disliked, for he is
of no consequence for estate, and less for parts, but is a
relation of the Pelhams,) and Lord Archibald Hamilton,(508)-to
please his Royal Highness.  Some of his
people (not the Lytteltons and Pitts) stayed away the other night
upon the Secret Committee, and they think he will at last rather
take his father's part, than Argyll's.

Poor Mr. PUltney has lost his girl: she was an only daughter, and
sensible and handsome.  He has only a son left, and, they say, is
afflicted to the greatest degree.

I will say nothing about old Sarah's Memoirs; for, with some
spirit they are nothing but remnants of old women's frippery.
Good night!  I recommend my poor Mr. Mann to you, and am
yours, most faithfully.

P. S. My dearest child, how unhappy I shall be, till I hear you
are quite recovered

several other motions to be made in consequence of that: and
likewise to bespeak their attendance at the Fountain, in order to

237 Letter 58
To Sir Horace Mann.
Monday, March 22, 1742.
[Great part of this letter is lost.]

*** I have at last received a letter from you in answer to the
first I wrote you upon the change in the ministry.  I hope you
have received mine regularly since, that you may know all the
consequent steps.  I like the Pasquinades you sent me, and think
the Emperor's(509) letter as mean as you do.  I hope his state
will grow more abject every day.  It is amazing, the progress and
success of the Queen of Hungary's arms! It is said to-day, that
she has defeated a great body of the
Prussians in Moravia.  We are going to extend a helping hand to
her at last.  Lord Stair (510) has accepted what my Lord Argyll
resigned, and sets out ambassador to Holland in two days; and
afterwards will have the command of' the troops that are to be
sent into Flanders.  I am sorry I must send away this to-night,
without being able to tell you the event of to-morrow; but I will
let you know it on Thursday, if I write but two lines.  You have
no notion how I laughed at Mrs.
Goldsworthy's "talking from hand to mouth."(511)  How happy I am
that you have Mr. Chute still with you; you would have been
distracted else with that simple woman; for fools prey upon one
when one has no companion to laugh Them off.

I shall say every thing that is proper for you to the earl, and
shall take care about expressing you to him, as I know you have
your gratitude far more at heart, than what I am thinking of for
you, I mean your stay at Florence.  I have spoken very warmly to
Lord Lincoln about you, who, I am sure, will serve you to his
power.  Indeed, as all changes are at a stop, I am convinced
there will be no thought of removing you.  However, till I see
the situation of next winter, I cannot be easy on your account.

I have made a few purchases at Lord Oxford's sale; a small
Vandyke, in imitation of Teniers; an old picture of the
Duchess of Suffolk, mother of Lady Jane Grey, and her young
husband; a sweet bronze vase by Flamingo, and two or three other
trifles.  The things sold dear; the antiquities and
pictures for about five thousand pounds, which yet, no doubt,
cost him much more, for he gave the most extravagant prices.  His
coins and medals are now selling, and go still dearer.  Good
night!  How I wish for every letter to hear how you mend!

(509) Charles VII. the Emperor of the Bavarian family.-D.

(510) John Dalrymple, second Earl of Stair, a man much
distinguished both as a general and a diplomatist. [He served
with credit at Dettingen; but, after that battle, resigned his
military rank, indignant at the King's unjust partiality to the
Hanoverians.  However, on the rebellion of 1745, he was made
commander-in-chief, and materially assisted the Duke of
Cumberland in the campaign which ended at Culloden.  He died in
1747.]

(511) An expression of Mr. Chute.



238 Letter 59
To sir Horace Mann.
March 24, 1742.

I promised you in my last letter to send you the event of
yesterday.(512)  It was not such as you would wish, for on the
division, at nine o'clock at night, we lost it by 242 against
245.  We had three people shut out, so that a majority of
three (513) is so small that it is scarce doubted, but that, on
Friday, when we ballot for the twenty-one to form the
committee, we shall carry a list composed of our people, so that
then it will be better that we lost it yesterday, as they never
can trouble my Lord Orford more, when the Secret
Committee consists of his own friends.  The motion was made and
seconded by the same people as before: Mr. Pultney had been
desired, but refused, yet spoke very warmly for it.  He declared,
"that if they found any proofs against the earl, he would not
engage in the prosecution;" and especially protested against
resumptions of grants to his family, of which. he
said, "there had been much talk, but they were what he would
never come into, as being very illegal and unjust." The motion
was quite personal against lord Orford, singly and by name, for
his last ten years-the former question had been for twenty years,
but as the rules of Parliament do not allow of
repeating any individual motion in the same session of its
rejection, and as 'every' evasion is allowed in this country,
half the term was voted by the same House of Commons that had
refused an inquiry into the whole; a sort of proof that every
omne majus does not continere in se minus-but Houses of
Commons can find out evasions to logical axioms, as well as to
their own orders.  If they carry their list, my lord will be
obliged to return from Houghton.

After the division.  Mr. Pultney(514) moved for an address to the
King; to declare their resolution of standing by him,
especially in assisting the Queen of Hungary-but I believe, after
the loss of the question, he will not be in very good humour with
this address.

I am now going to tell you what you, will not have
expected-that a particular friend of yours opposed the motion,
and it was the first time he ever spoke.  To keep you not in
suspense, though you must have guessed, it was 220.(515)  As the
speech was very favourably heard, and has done him
service, I prevailed with him to give me a copy-here it is:-

Mr. Speaker,(516)-I have always thought, Sir, that incapacity and
inexperience must prejudice the cause they undertake to defend;
and it has been diffidence of myself, not distrust of the cause,
that has hitherto made me so silent upon a point on which I ought
to have appeared so zealous.

"While the attempts for this inquiry were made in general
terms, I should have thought it presumption in me to stand up and
defend measures in which so many abler men have been
engaged, and which, consequently, they could so much better
support; but when the attack grows more personal, it grows my
duty to oppose it more particularly, lest I be suspected of an
ingratitude which my heart disdains.  But I think, Sir, I
cannot be suspected of that, unless my not having abilities to
defend my father can be construed into a desire not to defend
him.

"My experience, Sir, is very small; I have never been
conversant in business and politics, and have sat a very short
time in this house -with so slight a fund, I must much
mistrust my power to serve him-especially as in the short time I
have sat here, I have seen that not his own knowledge,
innocence, and eloquence, have been able to protect him
against a powerful and determined party.  I have seen, since his
retirement, that he has many great and noble friends, who have
been able to protect him from farther violence.  But, Sir, when
no repulses can calm the clamour against him, no motives should
sway his friends from openly undertaking his defence.  When the
King has conferred rewards on his services; when the Parliament
has refused its assent to any inquiries of complaint against him;
it is but maintaining the King's and our own honour, to reject
this motion-for the repeating which, however, I cannot think the
authors to blame, as I suppose now they have turned him out, they
are willing to inquire whether they had any reason to do so.

"I shall say no more, Sir, but leave the material part of this
defence to the impartiality, candour, and credit of men who are
no ways dependent on him.  He has already found that
defence, Sir, and I hope he always will! It is to their
authority I trust-and to me, it is the strongest proof of
innocence, that for twenty years together, no crime could be
solemnly alleged against him; and since his dismission, he has
seen a majority rise up to defend his character in that very
House of Commons in which a majority had overturned his power.
As, therefore, Sir, I must think him innocent, I stand up to
protect him from injustice-had he been accused, I should not have
given the House this trouble: but I think, Sir, that the
precedent of what was done upon this question a few days ago, is
a sufficient reason, if I had no other, for me to give my
negative now."

William Pitt, some time after, in the debate, said, how very
commendable it was in him to have made the above speech, which
must have made an impression upon the House; but if It was
becoming in him to remember that he was the child of the
accused, that the House ought to remember too that they are the
children of their country.  It was a great compliment from him,
and very artful too.

I forgot to tell you in my last, that one of our men-of-war,
commanded by Lord Bamffe,(518) a Scotchman, has taken another
register ship, of immense value.

You will laugh at a comical thing that happened the other day to
Lord Lincoln.  He sent the Duke of Richmond word that he would
dine with him in the country, and if he would give him leave,
would bring lord Bury with him.  It happens that Lord Bury is
nothing less than the Duke of Richmond's nephew.(519) The Duke,
very properly, sent him word back, that Lord Bury might bring
him, if he pleased.


I have been plagued all this morning with that oaf of unlicked
antiquity, Prideaux,(520) and his deaf boy.  He talked through
all Italy, and every thing in all Italy.  Upon mentioning
Stosch, I asked if he had seen his collection.  He replied, very
few of his things, for he did not like his company; that he never
heard so much heathenish talk in his days.  I
inquired what it was, and found that Stosch had one day said
before him, "that the soul was only a little glue." I laughed so
much that he walked off; I suppose, thinking, that I
believed so too.  By the way, tell Stosch that a gold Alectus
sold at Lord Oxford's sale for above threescore pounds.  Good
night, my dear child!  I am just going to the ridotto; one hates
those places, comes away out of humour, and yet one goes again!
How are you! I long for your next letter to answer me.

(512) The debate in the House of Commons on Lord Limerick's
motion for a Secret Committee to inquire into the conduct of the
Earl of Orford during the last ten years of his
administration.-E.

(513) The motion was carried by a majority of seven, the
numbers being 252 against 245.-E.

(514) This was much mentioned in the pamphlets written against
the war, which was said to have been determined "by a
gentleman's fumbling in his pocket for a piece of paper at ten
o'clock at night," and the House's agreeing to the motion
without any consideration.

Magazines of that time, but which does not contain one
sentence of the true one.

Oxford's diary.-,, March 23.  Motion by Lord Limerick, and
seconded by Sir J. St. Aubin, on the 9th instant, for a Secret
Committee of twenty-one, to examine into the Earl of Orford's
conduct for the last ten years of his being chancellor of the
exchequer and lord of the treasury.  Mr. Pultney said,
ministers should always remember the account they must make; that
he was against rancour in the inquiry, desired not to be named
for the committee, particularly because of a rash word he had
used, that he would pursue Sir Robert Walpole to his destruction;
that now the minister was destroyed, he had no ill-will to the
man; that from his own knowledge and
experience of many of the Tories, he believed them to be as
sincerely for the King and this family as himself; that he was
sensible of the disagreeable situation he was in, and would get
out of it as soon as he could.  Mr. Sandys spoke for the motion,
and said, he desired his own conduct might always be strictly
inquired into.  Lord Orford's son, and Mr. Ellis
spoke well against the motion.  It was carried by 252 against
245.  Three or four were shut out, who would have been against
it.  Mr. William -Finch against it. The Prince's servants for it.
Then Mr. Pultney moved for an address of duty to the King &e.
which he begged might pass without opposition; and
accordingly it did so.  But Mr. W. W. wynne and several
others, went out of the House; which was by some understood to be
disapprobation, by others accident or weariness," Secker MS.-E.

241 Letter 60
To Sir Horace Mann.
Downing Street, April 1, 1742.

I received your letter of March 18th, and would be as
particular in the other dates which you have sent me in the end
of your letter, but our affairs having been in such
confusion, I have removed all my papers In general from hence,
and cannot now examine them.  I have, I think, received all
yours: but lately I received them two days at least after
their arrival, and evidently opened; so we must be cautious now
what we write.  Remember this, for of your last the seal had been
quite taken off and set on again.

Last Friday we balloted for the Secret Committee.  Except the
vacancies, there were but thirty-one members absent: five
hundred and eighteen gave in lists.  At six that evening they
named a committee of which Lord Hartington was chairman, (as
having moved for it,) to examine the lists.  This lasted from
that time, all that night, till four in the afternoon of the next
day; twenty-two hours without remission.  There were
sixteen people, of which were Lord Hartington and Coke, who sat
up the whole time, and one of theirs, Velters
Cornwall,(521) fainted with the fatigue and heat, for people of
all sorts were admitted into the room, to see the lists drawn; it
was in the Speaker's chambers.  On the conclusion, they found the
majority was for a mixed list, but of which the Opposition had
the greater number.  Here are the two lists, which were given out
by each side, but of which people altered several in their
private lists.

THE COURT LIST.

William Bowles.
*Lord Cornbury.(522)
*William Finch.(523)
Lord Fitzwilliam.
Sir Charles Gilmour.
*Charles Gore.
H. Arthur Herbert.(524)
Sir Henry Liddel.(525)
John Plumptree (526)
Sir John Ramsden.
Strange, Solicitor-General.
Cholmley Turnor.
John Talbot.(527)
General Wade.(528)
James West.(529)

THE OPPOSITION LIST.

Sir John Barnard.
Alexander Hume Campbell.(530)
Sir John Cotton.
George Bubb Doddington.(531)
Nicholas Fazakerley.
Henry Furnese.
 Earl of Granird.
Mr. Hooper.(532)
Lord Limerick.(533)
George Lyttelton.(534)
John Philips-(535)
William Pitt.(536)
Mr. Prouse.
Edmund Waller.(537)
Sir Watkyn Williams Wynn.

Besides the following six which were in both lists-

These Six, On casting up the numbers, had those marked against
their names, and were consequently chosen.  Those with this mark
(*) were reckoned of the Opposition.

*George Compton 515
*William Noell 512 (538)
*Lord Quarendon 512 (539)
*Sir John Rushout 516 (540)
*Samuel Sandys 516 (541)
Sir John St. Aubin 518

On casting up the numbers, the lists proved thus:-

*Sir John Barnard 268
*Nicholas Fazakerley 262 (542)
*Henry Furnese 282
*Earl of Granard 258
*Mr.  Hooper 265
*William Pitt 259
*Mr. Prouse 259
*Edmund Waller 259
William Bowles 259
*Lord Cornbury 262
Solicitor-General 259
Cholmley Turnor 259

This made eighteen: Mr. Finch, Sir Harry Liddel, and Mr.
Talbot, had 258 each, and Hume Campbell 257, besides one in which
his name was mis-written, but allowed; out of these
four, two were to be chosen: it was agreed that the Speaker was
to choose them; he, with a resolution not supposed to be in him,
as he has been the most notorious affecter of
popularity, named Sir Harry Liddel and Mr. 'albot; so that, on
the whole, we have just five that we can call our own.(543)
These will not be sufficient to stop their proceedings, but by
being privy, may stop any iniquitous proceedings.  They have
chosen Lord Limerick chairman.  Lord Orford returns tomorrow from
Houghton to Chelsea, from whence my uncle went in great fright to
fetch him.

I was yesterday presented to the Prince and Princess; but had not
the honour of a word from either: he did vouchsafe to talk to
Lord Walpole the day before.

Yesterday the Lord Mayor brought in their favourite bill for
repealing the Septennial Act, but we rejected it by 284 to
204.(544)

You shall have particular accounts of the Secret Committee and
their proceedings: but It will be at least a month before they
can make any progress.  You did not say any thing about
yourself in your last; never omit it, my dear child.

(521) Velters Cornwall, Esq., of Meccas Court, in
Herefordshire, and member for that county.-D.

(522) Son of the Earl of Clarendon.

(523) Afterwards vice-chamberlain.

(524) Afterwards Earl of Powis.

(525) Afterwards Lord Ravensworth.

(526) He had a place in the Ordnance.

(527) Son of the late lord chancellor, and afterwards a judge.

(528) Afterwards field.marshal.

(529) Afterwards secretary of the treasury.

(530) Afterwards solicitor to the Prince.

(531) Had been a lord of the treasury.

(532) Had a place on a change of the ministry. (He was a
Hampshire gentleman, and member for Christchurch.-D.)

(533) Afterwards King's remembrancer.

(534) Afterwards cofferer.

(535) Afterwards a lord of trade and baronet.

(536) Afterwards paymaster.

(537) Afterwards cofferer.

(538) Afterwards a judge.

(539) Afterwards Earl of Lichfield.

(540) Afterwards treasurer of the navy.

(541) Afterwards chancellor of the exchequer, then cofferer, and
then a baron.

(542) Nicholas Fazakerley, Esq.  Walpole calls him "a tiresome
Jacobite lawyer." He, however, appears to have been a speaker of
some weight in the House of Commons, and distinguished
himself by his opposition to Lord Hardwicke's mischievous
marriage bill in the year 1753.-D.  (He died in 1767.)

(543) "March 26, 27. The House of commons balloted for their
committee, being called over, and each opening his list at the
table, and putting it into a vessel which stood there.  This was
ended by five.  Then a committee began to examine the
lists, and sat from that time till four the next afternoon: for,
though two lists were given out, many delivered in
consisted partly of one, and partly of the other; and many were
put in different order.  Sir Thomas Drury, a friend of Lord
Orford's, put down four of the opposite side in his list.  Lord
Orford's friends hoped it would bring moderate persons over to
them, if they put some on their list who were not
partial to him."-" March 29.  The decision between Sir H.
Lyddel, Mr. J. Talbot. and Mr. W. Finch, was left to the
Speaker, who chose the two former." Secker MS.-E.

(544) This is not correct.  It appears, by the Journals, that the
motion passed in the negative by 204 against 184.  The debate is
thus noticed by the Bishop of Oxford:-"March 31. Sir Robert
Cotschall, Lord Mayor, moved for the repeal of the
Septennial Bill.  Mr. Pultney said, he thought annual
parliaments would be best, but preferred septennial to
triennial and voted against the motion.  In all, 204 against it,
and 184 for it."  Secker MS.-E.



243 Letter 61
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, April 8, 1742.

You have no notion how astonished I was, at reading your
account of Sir Francis Dashwood!-that it should be possible for
private and personal pique so to sour any man's temper and
honour, and so utterly to change their principles!  I own I am
for your mentioning him in your next despatch: they may at least
intercept his letters, and prevent his dirty
intelligence.  As to Lady Walpole,(545) her schemes are so wild
and so ill-founded, that I don't think it worth while to take
notice of them.  I possibly may mention this new one of changing
her name, to her husband, and of her coming-over
design, but I am sure he will only laugh at it.

The ill-situation of the King, which you say is so much talked of
at the Petraia,(546) Is not true; indeed he and the Prince are
not at all more reconciled for being reconciled; but I think his
resolution has borne him out.  All the public
questions are easily carried, even with the concurrence of the
Tories.  Mr. Pultney proposed to grant a large sum for
assisting the Queen of Hungary, and got Sir John Barnard to move
it.  They have given the King five hundred thousand
pounds for that purpose.(547)  The land-tax of four shillings in
the pound is continued.  Lord Stair is gone to Holland, and
orders are given to the regiments and guards to have their camp
equipages ready.  As to the Spanish war and Vernon, there is no
more talk of them; one would think they had both been taken by a
privateer.

We talk of adjourning, soon for a month or six weeks, to give the
Secret Committee time to proceed, which yet they have not done.
Their object is returned from Houghton in great health and
greater spirits.  They are extremely angry with him for laughing
at their power.  The concourse to him is as great as ever; so is
the rage against him.  All this week the mob has been carrying
about his effigies in procession, and to the Tower.  The chiefs
of the Opposition have been so mean as to give these mobs money
for bonfires, particularly the Earls of Lichfield, Westmoreland,
Denbigh, (548) and Stanhope:(549) the servants of these last got
one of these figures, chalked out a place for the heart and shot
at it.  You will laugh at me, who, the other day, meeting one of
these mobs, drove up to it to see what was the matter: the first
thing I beheld was a maulkin, in a chair, with three footmen, and
a label on the breast, inscribed "Lady mary." (550)

The Speaker, who has been much abused for naming two of our
friends to the Secret Committee, to show his
disinterestedness, has resigned his place of treasurer of the
navy.  Mr. Clutterbuck,(551) one of the late treasury is to have
it; so there seems a stop put to any new persons from the
Opposition.

His Royal Highness is gone to Kew his drawing-rooms Will not be
so crowded at his return, as he has disobliged so many
considerable people, particularly the Dukes of Montagu (552) and
Richmond, Lord Albemarle,(553) etc.  The Richmond went twice, and
yet was not spoken to; nor the others; nay, he has vented his
princely resentment even upon the women, for to Lady Hervey, not
a word.

This is all the news except that little Brook (554) is on the
point of matrimony with Miss Hamilton, Lady Archibald's
daughter.  She is excessively pretty and sensible, but as
diminutive as he.


I forgot to tell you that the Place Bill has met with the same
fate from the Lords as the Pension Bill (555) and the
Triennial Act; so that, after all their clamour and changing of
measures, they have not been able to get one of their
popular bills passed, though the newspapers, for these three
months, have swarmed with instructions for these purposes, from
the constituents of all parts of Great Britain to their
representatives.

We go into mourning on Sunday for the old Empress Amelia.(556)
Lord Chedworth, (557) one of three new Peers, is dead.  We hear
the King of Sardinia is at Piacenza, to open the
campaign.  I shall be in continual fears lest they disturb you at
Florence.  All love to the Chutes, and my compliments to all my
old acquaintance. I don't think I have forgot one of Them.
Pataman is entirely yours, and entirely handsome. Good night!

(545) Margaret Rolle, a great Devonshire heiress, the wife of
Robert, Lord Walpole, afterwards second Earl of Orford, the
eldest son of the minister.  She was separated from her
husband, and had quarrelled violently with his whole family.  She
resided principally at Florence, where she died in 1781; having
married secondly, after the death of Lord Orford, the Hon.
Sewallis Shirley.  She was a woman of bad character, as well as
Half mad: which last quality she to communicated to her
unfortunate son George, third Earl of Orford.  She
succeeded, in her own right, to the baronies of Clinton and Say,
upon the death, in 1751, of Hugh, Earl and Baron
Clinton.-D.  (This lady was married to Lord Walpole in 1724.  In
a letter to the Countess of mar, written in that year, Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu says:- "I have so good an opinion of your taste,
to believe harlequin in person will not make you laugh so much as
the Earl of Stair's furious passion for Lady
Walpole, aged fourteen and some months.  Mrs. Murray undertook to
bring the business to bear, and provided the opportunity, a great
ingredient You'll Say but the young lady proved
skittish.  She did not only turn his heroic flame into present
ridicule, but exposed all his generous sentiments, to divert her
Husband and father-in-law."  Works, vol. ii. p. 188.]

(546) A villa belonging to the Great Duke, where Prince Craon
resided in summer.

(547) "April 2.  In the Commons, 500,000 pounds voted for the
Queen of Hungary; I believe nem. con. Sir John Barnard moved it;
which, Mr. Sandys told me, was that day making himself the
chancellor of the exchequer.  He told me, also, the King was
unwilling to grant the Prince 50,000 pounds a-year; and I am told
from other hands, that he saith he never promised it.  The Bishop
of Sarum (Sherlock) says, Sir Robert Walpole told him, the King
would give 30,000 pounds, but no more.  Mr.
Sandys appeared determined against admitting Tories, and said it
was wonderful their union had held so long, and could not be
expected to hold longer; that he could not imagine why
every body spoke against Lord Carteret, but that he had better
abilities than any body; that as soon as foreign affairs could be
settled, they would endeavour to reduce the expenses of the crown
and interest of the debts."  Secker MS.

(548) William Fielding, fifth Earl of Denbigh, died 1755.-D.

(549) Philip, second Earl Stanhope, eldest son of the general and
statesman, who founded this branch of the Stanhope family.  Earl
Philip was a man of retired habits, and much devoted to
scientific pursuits.  He died in 1786.-D.

(550) Lady Mary Walpole, daughter of Sir R. W.

(551) This Mr. Clutterbuck had been raised by Lord Carteret, when
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, whom he betrayed to Sir R. Walpole;
the latter employed him, but never would trust him.  He then
ingratiated himself with Mr. Pelham, under a pretence of candour
and integrity, and was continually infusing
scruples into him on political questions, to distress Sir R. On
the latter's quitting the ministry, he appointed a board of
treasury at his own house, in order to sign some grants; Mr.
Clutterbuck made a pretence to slip away, and never returned.  He
was a friend, too, of the Speaker's: when Sir R. W. was told that
Mr. Onslow had resigned his place, and that Mr.
Clutterbuck was to succeed him, said, "I remember that the Duke
of Roxburgh, who was a great pretender to conscience, persuaded
the Duke of Montrose to resign the seals of'
Secretary of state, on some scruple, and begged them himself the
next day."  Mr. Clutterbuck died very soon after this
transaction. [Mr. Clutterbuck was appointed treasurer of the navy
in May, and died in November following.]

creation. He was a man of Some talent, and great eccentricity.

him, "My son-in-law Montagu is fifty, and he is still as mere a
boy as if he was only fifteen.".-D.  On his death, in 1749),the
title became extinct.)

amiable prodigal who filled various great offices, through the
favour of Lady Yarmouth, who died insolvent.-D.  [He married. in
1723, Lady Anne Lennox, daughter of Charles, first Duke of
Richmond, and, whilst ambassador to the French court, died
suddenly at Paris, in 1755.]

in 1773.]

(555) "March 26.  The Pension Bill read a second time in the
Lords.  Duke of Devonshire said a few words against it.  Lord
Sandwich pleaded for it, that some persons now in the ministry
had patronized it, and for their sakes it should be committed;
Lord Romney, that some objections against it had been obviated by
alterations.  These three speeches lasted scarce half a quarter
of an hour.  The question being put for committing, not-content,

and Lord Berkeley against it." Secker

246 Letter 62
To Sir Horace Mann.
April 15, 1742.

The great pleasure I receive from your letters is a little abated
by my continually finding that they have been opened.  It is a
mortification as it must restrain the freedom of our
correspondence, and at a time when more than ever I must want to
talk to you.  Your brother showed me a letter, which I
approve extremely, yet do not think this a proper time for it;
for there IS not only no present prospect of any further
alterations, but, if there were, none that will give that
person any interest.  He really has lost himself so much, that it
will be long before he can recover credit enough to do any body
any service.  His childish and troublesome behaviour,
particularly lately (,but I Will not mention instances,
because I would not have it known whom I mean), has set him in
the lowest light imaginable.  I have desired your brother to keep
your letter, and when we see a necessary or convenient
opportunity, which I hope will not arrive, it shall be
delivered.  However, if you are still of that opinion, say so,
and your brother shall carry it.  At present, my dear child, I am
much more at repose about you, as I trust no more will
happen to endanger your situation.  I shall not only give you the
first notice, but employ all the means in my power to
prevent your removal.

The Secret Committee, it seems, are almost aground, and, it is
thought, will soon finish.  They are now reduced, as I hear, to
inquire into the last month, not having met with any
foundation for proceeding in the rest of the time.  However, they
have this week given a strong instance of' their
arbitrariness and private resentments.  They sent for
Paxton,(558) the solicitor of the treasury, and examined him
about five hundred pounds which he had given seven years ago at
Lord Limerick's election.  The man, as it directly tended to
accuse himself, refused to answer.  They complained to the House,
and after a long debate he was committed to the
sergeant-at-arms -, and to-day, I hear, for still refusing, will
be sent to Newgate.(559)  We adjourn to-day for ten days, but the
committee has leave to continue sitting. . But, my dear child,
you may be quite at ease, for they themselves seem to despair of
being able to effect any thing.

The Duke (560) is of age to-day, and I hear by the guns, is just
gone with the King, to take his seat in the Lords.

I have this morning received the jar of cedrati safe, for
which I give you a million of thanks.  I am impatient to hear of
the arrival of your secretary and the things at Florence; it is
time for you to have received them.

Here! Amorevoli has sent me another letter.  Would you believe
that our wise directors for next year will not keep the
Visconti, and have sent for the Fumagalli?  She will not be heard
to the first row of the pit.

I am growing miserable, for it is growing fine weather-that is,
every body is going out of town.  I have but just begun to like
London, and to be settled in an agreeable set of' people, and now
they are going to wander all over the kingdom.
Because they have some chance of having a month of good
weather they will bury themselves three more in bad.

The Duchess of Cleveland (561) died last night of what they call
a miliary fever, which is much about: she had not been ill two
days.  So the poor creature, her duke, is again to be let; she
paid dear for the hopes of being duchess dowager.  Lady Catherine
Pelham,(562) has miscarried of twins; but they are so miserable
with the loss of their former two boys, that they seem glad now
of not having any more to tremble for.

There is a man who has by degrees bred himself up to walk upon
stilts so high, that he now stalks about and peeps into one pair
of stairs windows.  If this practice should spread,
dining-rooms will be as innocent as chapels.  Good night! I never
forget my best loves to the Chutes.

P. S. I this moment hear that Edgecombe (563) and Lord
Fitzwilliam are created English peers: I am sure the first is,
and I believe the second.

(558) Commemorated in a line of Pope-"'Tis all a libel,
Paxton, Sir, will say."-D.

(559) On a division of 180 against 128, Paxton was this day
committed to Newgate where he remained till the end of the
session, July 15.  He died in April 1744.-E.

(560) The Duke of Cumberland, third Son of George the
Second.-E.

(561) Lady Henrietta Finch, sister of the Earl of Winchilsea,
wife of William, Duke of Cleveland. [On whose death, in 1774, the
title became extinct.]

(562) Catherine, sister of John Manners, Duke of Rutland, and
 wife of Henry Pelham.  They lost their two sons by an epidemic
sore-throat, after which she would never go to Esher, or any
house where she had seen them.

(563) Richard Edgecombe, a great friend of Sir R. Walpole, was
Created a baron to prevent his being examined by the Secret
Committee concerning the management of the Cornish boroughs.  (He
was created Lord Edgecumbe on the 20th of April, and in December
appointed chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.  He died in
1758.]



247 Letter 63
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, April 22, 1742.

You perceive, by the size of my paper, how little I have to say.
The whole town is out of town for Easter, and nothing left but
dust, old women, and the Secret Committee.  They go on warmly,
and have turned their whole thoughts to the
secret-service money, after which they are inquiring by all
methods.  Sir John Rawdon (564) (you remember that genius in
Italy) voluntarily swore before them that, at the late
election at Wallingforrd, he spent two thousand pounds, and that
one Morley promised him fifteen hundred more, if he would lay it
out. "Whence was Morley to have it?"-"I don't know; I believe
from the first minister." This makes an evidence.  It is thought
that they will ask leave to examine members, which was the reason
of Edgecumbe's going into the peerage, as they supposed he had
been the principal agent for the Cornish
boroughs.  Sir John Cotton said, upon the occasion, "Between
Newgate (565 and the House of Lords the committee will not get
information."

The troops for Flanders go on board Saturday se'nnight, the first
embarkation of five thousand men: the whole number is to be
sixteen thousand.  It is not yet known what success Earl Stair
has had at the Hague.  We are in great joy upon the news of the
King of Prussia's running away from the Austrians:
(566) though his cowardice is well established, it is yet
believed that the flight in question was determined by his head,
not his heart; in short, that it was treachery to his allies.

I forgot to tell you, that of the Secret Committee Sir John
Rushout and Cholmley TurnOr never go to it, nor, which is more
extraordinary, Sir John Barnard.  He says he thought their views
were more general, but finding them so particular
against one man, he Will not engage with them.

I have been breakfasting this morning at Ranelagh-garden:
(567) they have built an immense amphitheatre, with balconies
full of little ale-houses; it is in rivalry to Vauxhall, and
costs above twelve thousand pounds.  The building is not
finished, but, they get great sums by people going to see it and
breakfasting in the house: there were yesterday no less than
three hundred and eighty persons, at eighteen pence
a-piece.  You see how poor we are, when, with a tax of four
shillings in the pound, we are laying out such sums for cakes and
ale.

We have a new opera, with your favourite song, se cerca, se dice:
(568) Monticelli sings it beyond what you can conceive.  Your
last was of April 8th.  I like the medal of the Caesars and
Nihils (569) extremely; but don't at all like the cracking of
your house, (570) except that it drives away your
Pettegola. (571) What I like much worse is your recovering your
strength so slowly; but I trust to the warm weather.

Miss Granville, daughter of the late Lord Lansdown, (572) is
named maid of honour, in the room of Miss Hamilton, who I told
you is to be Lady Brook-they are both so small! what little eggs
they will lay!

How does my Princess?(573)  does not she deign to visit you too?
Is Sade (574) there still?  Is Madame Suares quite gone into
devotion yet?  Tell me any thing-I love any thing that you write
to me.  Good night!

(564) He was afterwards made an Irish lord. (Lord Rawdon in 1750,
and Earl of Moira in 1761.  His first two wives were the
daughters of the Earl of Egmont and Viscount Hillsborough.  His
third wife, by whom he was the father of the late Lord Hastings,
was the daughter, and eventually the heiress, of Theophilus,
ninth Earl of Huntingdon.-D.)

(565) Alluding to Paxton, who was sent thither for refusing to
 give evidence.

(566) this must allude to the King of Prussia's abandonment of
his design to penetrate through Austria to Vienna, which he gave
of) in consequence of the lukewarmness of his Saxon and the
absence of his French allies.  It is curious now, when the mist
of contemporary prejudices has passed away, to hear
Frederick the Great accused of cowardice.-D.

(567) the once celebrated place of amusement was so called from
its site being that of a villa of' Viscount Ranelagh, near
Chelsea. The last entertainment given in it was the
installation ball of the Knights of the Bath, in 1802.  It has

dominions, et Caesar et nihil.

(570) Sir H. Mann had mentioned, in one of his letters, the
appearance of several cracks in the walls of his house at

249 Letter 64
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, April 29, 1742.

By yours of April 17, N. S. and some of your last letters, I find
my Lady Walpole is more mad than ever-why, there never was so
wild a scheme as this, of setting up an interest
through Lord Chesterfield!  one who has no power; and, if he had,
would think of, or serve her, one of the last persons upon earth.
What connexion has he with what interest could he have in
obliging her? and, but from views, what has he ever done, or will
he ever do? But is Richcourt (575) so shallow, and so ambitious,
as to put any trust in there projects?  My dear child, believe
me, if I was to mention them here, they would sound so
chimerical, so womanish, that I should be
laughed at for repeating them.  For yourself, be quite at
rest, and laugh, as I do, at feeble, visionary malice, and assure
yourself, whoever mentions such politics to you, that my Lady
Walpole must have very frippery intelligence from
hence, if she can raise no better views and on no better
foundations.  For the poem you mention, I never read it: upon
inquiry, I find there was such a thing though now quite
obsolete: undoubtedly not Pope's, and only proves what I said
before, how low, how paltry, how uninformed her ladyship's
correspondents must be.

We are now all military! all preparations for Flanders! no
parties but reviews; no officers, but "hope" they are to go
abroad-at least, it is the fashion to say so.  I am studying
lists of regiments and Dames of colonels-not that "I hope I am to
go abroad," but to talk of those who do.  Three thousand men
embarked yesterday and the day before, and the thirteen thousand
others sail as soon as the transports can return.  Messieurs
d'Allemagne (576) roll their red eyes, stroke up their great
beards, and look fierce-you know one loves a
review and a tattoo.

We had a debate yesterday in the House on a proposal for
replacing four thousand men of some that are to be sent
abroad, that, in short, we might have fifteen thousand men to
guard the kingdom.  This was strongly opposed by the Tories, but
we carried it in the committee, 214 against 123, and
to-day, in the House, 280 against 169.  Sir John Barnard,
Pultney, the new ministry, all the Prince's people, except the
Cobham cousins,(577) the Lord Mayor, several of the
Opposition, voted with us; so you must interpret Tories in the
strongest sense of the word.

The Secret Committee has desired leave to-day to examine three
members, Burrel, Bristow, and Hanbury Williams: (578) the two
first are directors of the bank; and it is upon an agreement made
with them, and at which Williams was present, about
remitting some money to Jamaica, and in which they pretend Sir
Robert made a bad bargain, to oblige them as members of
Parliament.  they all three stood up, and voluntarily offered to
be examined; so no vote passed upon it.

These are all the political news: there is little of any other
sort; so little gallantry is stirring, that I do not hear of so
much as one maid of honour who has declared herself with child by
any officer, to engage him not to go abroad.  I told you once or
twice that Miss Hamilton is going to be married to Lord Brook:
somebody wished Lord Archibald joy.  He replied, "Providence has
been very good to my family."

We had a great scuffle the other night at the Opera, which
interrupted it.  Lord Lincoln was abused in the most shocking
manner by a drunken officer, upon which he kicked him, and was
drawing his sword, but was prevented.  were they were put
under arrest, and the next morning, the man begged his pardon
before the Duke of Marlborough, Lord Albemarle, and other
officers, in the most submissive terms.  I saw the quarrel from
the other side of the house, and rushing to get to Lord Lincoln,
could not for the crowd.  I climbed into the front boxes, and
stepping over the shoulders of three ladies, before I knew where
I was, found I had lighted in Lord Rockingham's (579) lap.  It
was ridiculous! Good night!

(575) Count Richcourt was a Lorrainer, and chief minister of
Florence; there was a great connexion between him and Lady
Walpole.

(576)The royal family.

(577) Pitts, Grenvilles, Lytteltons, all related by marriage, or
female descent, to Lord Cobham.-D.

(578) Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, a devoted follower of Sir
Robert Walpole.  His various satirical poems against the
enemies and successors of that minister are well known, and must
ever be admired for their ease, their spirit, and the wit and
humour of their sarcasm.  It was said at the time that Sir
Charles's poetry had done more in three months to lower and
discredit those it was written against, than the Craftsman and
other abusive papers had been able to effect against Sir
Robert in a long series of years.-D.

(579) Lewis Watson, second Earl of Rockingham.  He married
Catharine, second daughter and coheir of George Sondes, Earl of
Feversham, and died in 1745.-D.



251 Letter 65
To Richard West, Esq.
London, May 4, 1742.

Dear West,
Your letter made me quite melancholy, till I came to the
postscript of fine weather.  Your so suddenly finding the
benefit of it makes me trust you will entirely recover your
health and spirits with the warm season: nobody wishes it more
than I: nobody has more reason, as few have known you so long.
Don't be afraid of your letters being dull.  I don't deserve to
be called your friend, if I were impatient at hearing your
complaints.  I do not desire you to suppress them till the causes
cease; nor should I expect you to write cheerfully
while you are Ill.  I never desire to write any man's life as a
stoic, and consequently should not desire him to furnish me with
opportunities of assuring posterity what pains he took not to
show any pain.

If you did amuse yourself with writing any thing in poetry, you
know how pleased I should be to see it; but for
encouraging you to it, d'ye see, 'tis an age most unpoetical!
'Tis even a test of wit to dislike poetry; and though Pope has
half a dozen old friends that he has preserved from the taste of
last century, yet, I assure you, the generality of readers are
more diverted with any paltry prose answer to old
Marlborough's secret history of Queen Mary's robes.  I do not
think an author would be universally commended for any
production in verse, unless it were an ode to the Secret
Committee, with rhymes of liberty and property, nation and
administration.

Wit itself is monopolized by politics; no laugh would be
ridiculous if it were not on one side or t'other.  Thus,
Sandys thinks he has spoken an epigram, when he crincles up his
nose and lays a smart accent on ways and means.

We may, indeed. hope a little better now to the declining
arts.  The reconciliation between the royalties is finished, and
fifty thousand pounds a-year more added to the heir
apparent's revenue.  He will have money now to tune up Glover,
and Thomson, and Dodsley again: Et spes
et ratio studiorum in Caesare tantUM.

Asheton is much yours.  He has preached twice at Somerset
Chapel with the greatest applause.  I do not mind his pleasing
the generality, for you know they ran as much after Whitfield as
they could after Tillotson; and I do not doubt but St. Jude
converted as many Honourable women as St. Paul.  But I am sure
you would approve his compositions, and admire them still more
when you heard him deliver them.  He will write to you himself
next post, but is not mad enough with his fame to write you a
sermon.  Adieu, dear child!  Write me the progress of your
recovery,(580) and believe it will give me a sincere pleasure;
for I am, yours ever.

(580) Mr. West died in less than a month from the date of this
letter, in the twenty-sixth year of his age.  (see ant`e, p. 121,
Letter 1.)  In his last letter to Grey, written a few days before
his death, he says, "I will take my leave of you for the present,
with a vale et vive paulisper cum vivis:" so little was he aware
of the short time that he himself would be
numbered among the living.  But this is almost constantly the
case with those who die of that most flattering of all
diseases, a consumption.  "Shall humanity," says Mason, "be
thankful or sorry that it is so?  Thankful, surely! for as this
malady generally attacks the young and the innocent, it seems the
merciful intention of Heaven, that to these death should come
unperceived, and, as it were, by stealth; divested of one of its
sharpest stings, the lingering expectation of their
dissolution."-E.




252 Letter 66
To Sir Horace Mann.
Downing Street, May 6, 1742.

I have received a long letter from you of the 22d of April.  It
amazes me! that our friends of Florence should not prove our
friends.(581)  Is it possible?  I have always talked of their
cordiality, because I was convinced they could have no shadow of
interest in their professions:--of that, indeed, I am convinced
still-but how could they fancy they had?  There is the wonder!
If they wanted common honesty, they seem to have wanted common
sense more.  What hope of connexion could there ever be between
the British ministry and the Florentine nobility!  The latter
have no views for being, or knowledge for being envoys, etc.
They are too poor and proud to think of trading with us; too
abject to hope for the restoration of their liberty from us-and,
indeed, however we may affection our own, we have showed no
regard for their liberty-they have had no reason ever to expect
that from us!  In short, to me it is mystery! But how could you
not tell me some particulars?  Have I so little interested myself
with Florence, that you should think I can be satisfied without
knowing the least particulars? I must know names.  Who are these
wretches that I am to scratch out of my list?  I shall give them
a black blot the moment I know who have behaved ill to you.  Is
Casa Ferroni of the number?  I suspect it:-that was of your first
attachments.  Are the prince and princess dirty?-the Suares?-tell
me, tell me!  Indeed, my dear Mr. Chute, I am not of your
opinion, that he should shut himself up and despise them; let him
go abroad and despise them.  Must he mope because the Florentines
are like the rest of the world? But that is not true, for the
world in England have not declared themselves so suddenly.  It
has not been the fashion to desert the earl and his friends: he
has had more concourse, more professions, and has still, than in
the height of his power.  So your neighbours have been too hasty:
they are new style, at least, eleven days before us.  Tell them,
tell Richcourt, tell his Cleopatra,(582) that all their hopes are
vanished, all their faith in Secret Committees-the reconciliation
is made, and whatever reports their secretships may produce,
there will be at least above a hundred votes added to our party.
Their triumph has been but in hope, and their hope has failed in
two months.

As to your embroil with Richcourt, I condemn you excessively: not
that you was originally in fault, but by seeming to own yourself
so. He is an impertinent fellow, and will be so if you'll let
him.  My dear child, act with the spirit of your friends here;
show we have lost no credit by losing power, and that a little
Italian minister must not dare to insult you.  Publish the
accounts I send you; which I give you my honour are authentic.
If they are not, let Cytheris, your Antony's travelling
concubine, contradict them.

You tell me the St. Quintin is arrived at Genoa: I see by the
prints of to-day that it is got to leghorn: I am extremely glad,
for I feared for it, for the poor boy, and for the things.  Tell
me how you like your secretary.  I shall be quite happy, if I
have placed one with you that you like.

I laughed much at the family of cats I am to receive.  I believe
they will be extremely welcome to Lord Islay now: for he appears
little, lives more darkly and more like a wizard than ever.
These huge cats will figure prodigiously in his cell: he is of'
the mysterious, dingy nature of Stosch.

As words is what I have not rhetoric to
find out to thank you, for sending me this paragraph of Madame
Goldsworthy, I can only tell you that I have laughed for an hour
at it.  This was one of my Lady Pomfret's correspondents.

There seems to be a little stop in our embarkations: since the
first, they have discovered that the horse must not go till all
the hay is provided.  Three thousand men will make a fine figure
towards supporting the balance of power! Our whole number was to
be but sixteen; and if all these cannot be assembled before the
end of July, what will be said of it?

The Secret Committee go on very pitifully: they are now inquiring
about some customhouse officers that were turned out at Weymouth
for voting wrong at elections.  Don't you think these articles
will prove to the world what they have been saying of Sir Robert
for these twenty years?  The House still sits in observance to
them; which is pleasant to me, for it keeps people in town.  We
have operas too; but they are almost over, and if it were not for
a daily east wind, they would give way to Vauxhall and Chelsea.
The new directors have agreed with the Fumagalli for next year,
but she is to be second woman: they keep the Visconti. Did I
never mention the Bettina, the first dancer.  It seems she was
kept by a Neapolitan prince, who is extremely jealous of her
thither.  About a fortnight ago, she fell ill, upon which her
Neapolitan footman made off immediately.  She dances again, but
is very weak, and thinks herself poisoned.

Adieu! my dear child; tell me you are well, easy, and in
spirits: kiss the Chutes for me, and believe me, etc

(581) This alludes to an account given by Sir Horace Mann, in one
of his letters, of the change he had observed in the manner of
many of the Florentines towards himself since Sir Robert
Walpole's retirement from office, upon the supposition
entertained by them that he was intimately connected with the
fallen minister@D.

254 Letter 67
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, May 13, 1742.

As I am obliged to put my letter into the secretary's office by
nine o'clock, and it now don't want a quarter of it, I can say
but three words, and must defer till next post answering Your
long letter by the courier.  I am this moment come from the
House, where we have had the first part of the Report from the
Secret Committee. It is pretty long; but, unfortunately for them,
there is not once to be found in it the name of the Earl of
Orford: there is a good deal about Mr. Paxton and the borough of
Wendover; and it appears that in eleven years Mr. Paxton has
received ninety-four thousand pounds unaccounted for: now, if
Lady Richcourt can make any thing of all this, you have freely my
leave to communicate it to her.  Pursuant to this report, and Mr.
Paxton's contumacy, they moved for leave to bring in a bill to
indemnify all persons who should accuse themselves of any crime,
provided they do but accuse Lord Orford, and they have carried it
by 251 to 228! but it is so absurd a bill, that there is not the
least likelihood of its passing the Lords.  By this bill, whoever
are guilty of murder, treason, forgery, etc. have nothing to do
but to add perjury, and swear Lord Orford knew of it, and they
may plead their pardon.  Tell Lady Richcourt this.  Lord Orford
knew of her gallantries: she may plead her pardon.  Good night! I
have not a moment to lose.




254 Letter 68
To Sir Horace Mann.
May 20, 1742.

I sent you a sketch last post of the division on the Indemnity
Bill.  As they carried the question for its being brought in,
they brought it in on Saturday; but were prevailed on to defer
the second reading till Tuesday.  Then we had a long debate till
eight at night, when they carried it, 228 against 217, only
eleven majority: before, they had had twenty-three.  They
immediately went into the committee on it,-and reported it that
night.  Yesterday it came to the last reading; but the House,
having sat so late the night before, was not so full, and they
carried it, 216 to 184.  But to-day it comes into the
Lords,-where they do not in the least expect to succeed; yet, to
show their spirit, they have appointed a great dinner at the
Fountain to-morrow to consider on methods for supporting the
honour of the Commons, as they call it, against the Lords, So now
all prospect of quiet seems to vanish!  The noise this bill makes
is incredible; it is so unprecedented, so violent a step! Every
thing is inflamed by Pultney, who governs both parties only, I
think, to exasperate both more.  Three of our own people of the
committee, the Solicitor,(582) Talbot, and Bowles, vote against
us in the Indemnity Bill, the two latter have even spoke against
us.  Sir Robert said, at the
beginning, when he was congratulated on having some of his own
friends in the committee, "The moment they are appointed, they
will grow so jealous of the honour of their committee, that they
will prefer that to every other consideration."(583)

Our foreign news are as bad as our domestic: there seem little
hopes of the Dutch coming into our measures; there are even
letters, that mention strongly their resolution of not
stirring-so we have Quixoted away sixteen thousand men! On
Saturday we had accounts of the Austrians having cut off two
thousand Prussians, in a retreat; but on Sunday came news of the
great victory,(584) which the latter have gained, killing six,
and taking two thousand Austrians prisoners, and that Prince
Charles is retired to Vienna wounded.  This will but too much
confirm the Dutch in their apprehensions of Prussia.
As to the long letter you wrote me, in answer to a very
particular one of mine, I cannot explain myself, till I find a
safer conveyance than the post, by which, I perceive all our
letters are opened.  I can only tell you, that in most things you
guessed right; and that as to myself (585) all is quiet.
I am in great concern, for you seem not satisfied with the boy we
sent you.  Your brother entirely agreed with me that he was what
you seem to describe; and as to his being on the foot of a
servant, I give you my honour I repeated it over and over to his
mother.  I suppose her folly was afraid of shocking him.  As to
Italian, she assured me he had been learning it some time.  If he
does not answer your purpose, let me know if you can dispose of
him any other way, and I will try to
accommodate you better.  Your brother has this moment been here,
but there was no letter for me; at least, none that they will
deliver yet.

I know not in the least how to advise Mr. Jackson.(586)  I do not
think Mr. Pelham the proper person to apply to; for the Duke of
Newcastle is as jealous of him as of any body.(587)  Don't say
this to him.  For Lord Hervey, though Mr. Jackson has interest
there, I would not advise him to try it, for both hate him.  The
application to the Duke of Newcastle by the Most direct means, I
should think the best, or by any one that can be serviceable to
the government.

You will laugh at an odd accident that happened the other day to
my uncle:(588) they put him into the papers for Earl of
Sheffield.  There have been little disputes between the two
Houses about coming into each other's House; when a lord comes
into the Commons, they call out, withdraw: that day, the
moment my uncle came in, they all roared out, Withdraw!
withdraw!

The great Mr. Nugent has been unfortunate, too, in parliament;
besides being very ill heard, from being a very indifferent
speaker, the other day on the Place Bill, (which, by the way, we
have new modelled and softened, and to which the Lords have
submitted to agree to humour Pultney,) he rose, and said, "He
would not vote, as he was not determined in his opinion; but he
would offer his sentiments; which were, particularly, that the
bishops had been the cause of this bill being thrown out before."
Winnington called him to order, desiring he would be tender of
the Church of England.  You know he was a papist.  In answer to
the beginning of his speech, Velters Cornwall, who is of the same
side, said, "He wondered that when that gentleman could not
convince himself by his eloquence, he
should expect to convince the majority."

Did I tell you that Lord Rochford,(589) has at last married Miss
Young?(590)  I say, at last, for they don't pretend to have been
married this twelvemonth; but they were publicly married last
week.  Adieu!

(585) This relates to some differences between Mr. Walpole and
his father, to which the former had alluded in one of his
letters.  They never suited one another either in habits,
tastes, or opinions; in addition to which, Sir Robert appears to
have been rather a harsh father to his youngest son.  If such was
the case, the latter nobly revenged himself, by his earnest
solicitude through life for the Honour of his parent's memory.-D.

256 Letter 69
To Sir Horace Mann
Downing Street, May 26, 1742.

To-day calls itself May the 26th, as you perceive by the date;
but I am writing to you by the fireside, instead of going to
Vauxhall.  if we have one warm day in seven, "we bless our stars,
and think it luxury."  And yet we have as much
waterworks and fresco diversions, as if we lay ten degrees nearer
warmth.  Two nights ago Ranelagh-gardens were opened at Chelsea;
the Prince, Princess, Duke, much nobility, and much mob besides,
were there.  There is a vast amphitheatre, finely gilt, painted,
and illuminated, into which every body that loves eating,
drinking, staring, or crowding, is admitted for twelvepence.  The
building and disposition of the gardens cost sixteen thousand
pounds.  Twice a-week there are to be
ridottos, at guinea tickets, for which you are to have a
supper and music.  I was there last night, but did not find the
joy of it.  Vauxhall is a little better; for the garden is
pleasanter, and one goes by water.  Our operas are almost
over; there were but three-and-forty people last night in the pit
and boxes.  There is a little simple farce at Drury Lane, called
"Miss Lucy in Town,"(591) in which Mrs. Clive (592) mimes the
Muscovita admirably, and Beard, Amorevoli tolerably.  But all the
run is now after Garrick, a wine-merchant, who is turned player,
at Goodman's-fields.  He plays all parts, and is a very good
mimic.  His acting I have seen, and may say to you, who will not
tell it again here, I see nothing wonderful in it.(593)  but it
is heresy to say so: the Duke of Argyll says, he is superior to
Betterton.  Now I talk of players, tell Mr. Chute that his friend
Bracegirdle breakfasted with me this morning.  As she went out,
and wanted her clogs, she
turned to me, and said, "I remember at the playhouse, they used
to call Mrs.  Oldfield's chair! Mrs. Barry's clogs! and Mrs.
Bracegirdle's pattens!"

I did, indeed, design the letter of this post for Mr. Chute; but
I have received two such charming long ones from you of the 15th
and 20th of May (N.  S.), that I must answer them, and beg him to
excuse me till another post; so must the
Prince,(594) Princess, the Grifona, and Countess Galli.  For the
Princess's letter, I am not sure I shall answer it so
soon, for hitherto I have not been able to read above every third
word; however, you may thank her as much as if I
understood it all.  I am very happy that mes bagatelles (for I
still insist they were so) pleased.  You, my dear child, are very
good to be pleased with the snuff-box.. I am much obliged to the
superior lumi`eres of old Sarasin (595) about the
Indian ink: if' she meant the black, I am sorry to say I had it
into the bargain with the rest of the Japan: for the
coloured, it is only a curiosity, because it has seldom been
brought over.  I remember Sir Hans Sloane was the first who ever
had any of it, and would on no account give my mother the least
morsel of it.  since that, She afterwards got a good deal of it
from China; and more has come over; but it is even less valuable
than the other, for we never could tell how to use it; however,
let it make its figure.

I am sure you blame me all this time, for chatting about so many
trifles, and telling you no politics.  I own to you, I am so
wearied, so worn with them, that I scarce know how to turn my
hand to them; but you shall know all I know.  I told you of the
meeting at the Fountain tavern: Pultney had promised to be there,
but was-not; nor Carteret.  As the Lords had put off the debate
on the Indemnity Bill, nothing material passed; but the meeting
was very Jacobite.  Yesterday the bill came on, and Lord Carteret
took the lead against it, and about seven in the evening it was
flung out by almost two to one, 92 to 47, and 17 proxies to 10.
To-day we had a motion by the new Lord
Hillsborough,(596) (for the father is Just dead,) and seconded by
Lord Barrington,(597) to examine the Lords' votes, to see what
has become of the bill: this is the form.  The chancellor of the
exchequer, and all the new ministry, were with us
against it; but they carried it, 164 to 159.  It is to be
reported to-morrow, and as we have notice, we may possibly throw
it out; else they will hurry on to a breach with the Lords.
Pultney was not in the House: he was riding the other day, and
met the King's coach; endeavouring to turn out of the way, his
horse started, flung him, and fell upon him: he is much bruised
but not at all dangerously.  On this occasion, there was an
epigram fixed to a list, which I will explain to you afterwards
it is not known who wrote it, but it was
addressed to him:

"Thy horse does things by halves, like thee:
Thou, with irresolution,
Hurt'st friend and foe, thyself and me,
The King and Constitution."

The list I meant: you must know, some time ago, before the
change, they had moved for a committee to examine, and state the
public accounts: It was passed.  Finding how little
success they had with their Secret Committee, they have set this
on foot, and we were to ballot for seven commissioners, who are
to have a thousand a-year; We balloted yesterday: on our lists
were Sir Richard Corbet,(598) Charles Hamilton (599) Lady
Archibald's brother,) Sir William Middleton,(600) Mr. West, Mr.
Fonnereau, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Ellis.(601)  On theirs
 Mr. Bance, George Grenville, Mr. Hooper, Sir Charles
Mordaunt,(602) Mr, Phillips, Mr. Pitt, and Mr. Stuart.  On
casting up the numbers, the four first on ours, and the three
first on their list, appeared to have the majority,: so no great
harm will come from this, should it pass the Lords;
which it is not likely to do.  I have now told you, I think, all
the political news, except that the troops continue going to
Flanders, though we hear no good news yet from Holland.
If we can prevent any dispute between the two Houses, it is
believed and much hoped by the Court, that the Secret
Committee will desire to be dissolved: if it does, there is an
end of all this tempest!

I must tell you an ingenuity of Lord Raymond,(603) an epitaph on
the Indemnifying Bill-I believe you would guess the
author:-

"Interr'd beneath this marble stone doth lie
The Bill of Indemnity;
To show the good for which it was designed,
It died itself to save mankind."

My Lady Townshend made me laugh the other night about your old
acquaintance, Miss Edwin; who, by the way, is grown almost a
Methodist.  My lady says she was forced to have an issue made on
one side of her head, for her eyes, and that Kent(604)
advised her to have another on the other side for symmetry.
There has lately been published one of the most impudent
things that ever was printed; it is called "The Irish
Recister," and is a list of all the unmarried women of any
fashion in England, ranked in order, duchesses-dowager,
ladies, widows, misses, etc. with their names at length, for the
benefit of Irish fortune-hunters, or as it is said, for the
incorporating and manufacturing of British commodities.  Miss
Edwards(605) is the only one printed with a dash, because they
have placed her among the widows.  I will send you this, "Miss
Lucy in Town," and the magazines, by the first
opportunity, as I should the other things, but your brother tells
me you have had then) by another hand.  I received the cedarati,
for which I have already thanked you: but I have been so much
thanked by several people to whom I gave some, that I can very
well afford to thank you again.

As to Stosch expecting any present from me, he was so
extremely well paid for all I had of' him, that I do not think
myself at all in his debt: however, you was very good to offer to
pay him.

As to my Lady Walpole, I shall say nothing now, as I have not
seen either of the two persons since I received your letter to
whom I design to mention her; only that I am extremely sorry to
find you still disturbed at any of the little nonsense of' that
cibal.  I hoped that the accounts which I have sent you, and
which, except in my last letter, must have been very
satisfactory, would have served you as an antidote to their
legends; and I think the great victory in the House of Lords, and
which, I assure you, is here reckoned prodigious, Will raise your
spirits against them.  I am happy you have taken that step about
Sir Francis Dashwood; the credit it must have given you with the
King will more than counterbalance any
little hurt you might apprehend from the cabal.

I am in no hurry for any of my things; as we shall be moving from
hence as soon as Sir Robert has taken another house, I shall not
want them till I am more settled.

Adieu! I hope to tell you soon that we are all at peace, and then
I trust you will be so.  A thousand loves to the Chutes.  How I
long to see you all!

P. S. I unseal my letter to tell you what a vast and,
probably, final victory we have gained to-day.  They moved, that
the lords flinging out the Bill of Indemnity was an
obstruction of justice, and might prove fatal to the liberties
of' this country.  We have sat till this moment, seven
o'clock, and have rejected this motion by 245 to 193.  The call
of the House, which they have kept off from fortnight to
fortnight, to keep people in town, was appointed for to-day.  The
moment the division was over, Sir John Cotton rose and said, "As
I think the inquiry is at an end, you may do what you will with
the call." We have put it off for two months.  There's a noble
postscript!

(591) This farce, the production of Fielding, was acted
several nights with success; but it being hinted, that one of the
characters was written in ridicule of a man of quality, the Lord
Chamberlain sent an order to forbid its being
performed any more.-E.

(592) catherine Clive, an excellent actress in low comedy.
Churchill says of her, in the Rosciad,

In spite of outward blemishes she shone,
For humour famed, and humour all her own.
Easy, as if at home, the stage she trod,
Nor sought the critic's praise, nor fear'd his rod
Original in spirit and in ease,
She pleased by hiding all attempts to please.
No comic actress ever yet could raise
On humour's base, more merit or more praise."

In after life she lived at Twickenham, in the house now called
Little Strawberry Hill, and
became an intimate friend of Horace Walpole@D.

(593) Garrick made his first appearance, October 19, 1741, in the
character of Richard the Third.  Walpole does not appear to have
been singular in the opinion here given.  Gray in a letter to
Chute, says, "Did I tell you about Mr. Garrick, that the town are
horn-mad after: there are a dozen dukes of a
night at Goodman-fields sometimes; and vet I am stiff in the
opposition."-E.

(594) prince Craon.

(595) Madame Sarasin, a Lorrain lady, companion to Princess
Craon.

(596) Wills Hill, the second Lord Hillsborough, afterwards
created an Irish earl and made cofferer of the household. (In the
reign of George III. he was created Earl of Hillsborough, in
England, and finally Marquis of Downshire, in Ireland; and held
the office of secretary of state for the colonies.-D.)

(597) William Wildman, Viscount Barrington, made a lord of the
admiralty on the coalition, and master of the great wardrobe, in
1754.  He afterwards held the offices of chancellor of the
exchequer, secretary at war, and treasurer of the navy, and died
February 1st, 1793.-D.)

(598) Sir Richard Corbett, of Leighton, in Montgomeryshire, the
fourth baronet of that family. He was member for
Shrewsbury, and died in 1774.-D.

(599) The Hon. Charles Hamilton, sixth son of James, sixth Earl
of Abercorn.  Member for Truro, comptroller of the green cloth to
the Prince of Wales, and subsequently receiver-general of the
Island of Minorca.  He died in 1787.-D.

(600) Sir William Middleton, Bart. of Belsay Castle,
Northumberland, the third baronet of the family.  He was
member for Northumberland, and died in 1767.-D.''

(601) Welbore Ellis, member of parliament for above half a
century; during which period he held the different offices of a
lord of the admiralty, secretary at war, treasurer of the navy,
vice-treasurer of Ireland, and secretary of state. He was created
Lord Mendip in 1794, with remainder to his nephew, Viscount
Clifden, and died February 2, 1802, at the age of
eighty-eight.-D.

(602) Sir Charles Mordaunt, of Massingham, in Norfolk, the sixth
baronet of the family.  He was member for the county of Warwick,
and died in 1778.-D.

(603) Robert, the second Lord Raymond, son of the lord chief
justice.  [On whose death, in 1753, without issue, the title
expired.]

(604) William Kent, of whom Walpole himself drew the following
just character:-"He was a painter, an architect, and the
father of modern gardening.  In the first character he was below
mediocrity; in the second, he was a restorer of the
science; in the last, an original, and the inventor of an art
that realizes painting and improves nature.  Mahomet imagined an
elysium, Kent created many."-The misfortune of Kent was, that his
fame and popularity in his own age were so great, that he was
employed to give designs for all things, even for those which he
could know nothing about-such as ladies'
birthday dresses, which he decorated with the five orders of
architecture.  These absurdities drew upon him the satire of
Hogarth.-D.  [Walpole further states of Kent, that Pope
undoubtedly contributed to form his taste.]

(605) Miss Edwards, an unmarried lady of great fortune, who
openly kept Lord Anne Hamilton.




260 Letter 70
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, June 3, 1742.

I have sent Mr. Chute all the news; I shall only say to you that
I have read your last letter about Lady W. to Sir R.  He was not
at all surprised at her thoughts of England, but told me that
last week my Lord Carteret had sent him a letter which she had
written to him, to demand his protection.  This you may tell
publicly; it will show her ladyship's credit.

Here is an epigram, which I believe will divert you: it is on
Lord Islay's garden upon Hounslow Heath.

"Old Islay, to show his fine delicate taste,(606)
In improving his gardens purloined from the waste,
Bade his gard'ner one day to open his views,
By cutting a couple of grand avenues:
No particular prospect his lordship intended,
But left it to chance how his walks should be ended.

With transport and joy he beheld his first view end
In a favourite prospects church that was ruin'd-
But alas! what a sight did the next cut exhibit!
At the end of the walk hung a rogue on a gibbet!
He beheld it and wept, for it caused him to muse on
Full many a Campbell that died with his shoes on.
All amazed and aghast at the ominous scene,
He order'd it quick to be closed up again
With a clump of Scotch firs that served for a Screen."

Sir Robert asked me yesterday about the Dominichini, but I did
not know what to answer: I said I would write to you about it.
Have you bought it? or did you quite put it off? I had forgot to
mention it again to you.  If you have not, I am still of opinion
that you should buy it for him.  Adieu!

(606) These lines were written by Bramston, author of
"The Art of Politics," and "The Man of Taste." [The Reverend
James Bramston, vicar of Starling, Sussex.  Pope took the line in
the Dunciad, "Shine in the dignity of F. R. S." from his Man of
Taste;-"A satire," says Warton, "in which the author has been
guilty of the absurdity of making his hero laugh at himself and
his own follies."  He died in 1744.]



261 Letter 71
To Sir Horace Mann.
June 10, the Pretender's birthday, which, by the way, I believe
he did not expect to keep at Rome this year, 1742.

Since I wrote you my last letter, I have received two from you of
the 27th May and 3d of June, N. S. I hope you will get my two
packets; that is, one of them was addressed to Mr. Chute, and in
them was all my fagot of compliments.

Is not poor SCUlly (607) vastly disappointed that we are not
arrived? But really, will that mad woman never have done! does
she still find credit for her extravagant histories.  I
carried her son with me to Vauxhall last night: he is a most
charming boy,(608) but grows excessively like her in the face.
I don't at all foresee how I shall make out this letter: every
body is gone out of town during the Whitsuntide, and many will
not return, at least not these six weeks; for so long they say it
will be before the Secret Committee make their Report, with which
they intend to finish.  We are, however, entertained with
pageants every day-reviews to gladden the heart of
David,(609) (609) and triumphs to Absalom! He,(610) and his wife
went in great parade yesterday through the city and the dust to
dine at Greenwich; they took water at the Tower, and trumpeting
away to Grace Tosier's,

"Like Cimon, triumph'd over land and wave"

I don't know whether it was my Lord of Bristol (611) or some of
the SaddlerS,((612) Company who had told him that this was the
way "to steal the hearts of the people." He is in a
quarrel with Lord Falmouth.(613)  There is just dead one
Hammond,(614) a disciple of Lord Chesterfield,
and equerry to his royal highness: he had parts, and was Just
come into parliament, strong of the Cobham faction, or
nepotism, as Sir Robert calls it.  The White Prince desired Lord
Falmouth to choose Dr. Lee, who, you know, has disobliged the
party by accepting a lordship of the admiralty.  Lord
Falmouth has absolutely refused, and insists upon choosing one of
his own brothers: his highness talks loudly of opposing him.  The
borough is a Cornish one.

There is arrived a courier from Lord Stair, with news of
Prince Lobkowitz having cut off five thousand French.  We are
hurrying away the rest of our troops to Flanders, and say that we
are in great spirits, and intend to be in greater when we have
defeated the French too.

For my own particular, I cannot say I am well; I am afraid I have
a little fever upon my spirits, or at least have nerves, which,
you know, every body has in England.  I begin the
cold-bath to-morrow, and talk of going to Tunbridge, if the
parliament rises soon.

Sir R. who begins to talk seriously of Houghton, has desired me
to go -with him thither;' but that is not all settled.  Now I
mention Houghton, you was in the right to miss a gallery there;
but there is one actually fitting up, where the
green-house was, and to be furnished with the spoils of
Downing-street.

I am quite sorry you have [)ad so much trouble with those
odious cats of Malta: dear child, fling them into the Arno, if
there is water enough at this season to drown them; or, I'll tell
you, give them to Stosch, to pay the postage he talked of.  I
have no ambition to make my court with them to the old wizard.

I think I have not said any thing lately to you from Patapan; he
is handsomer than ever, and crows fat: his eyes are
charming; they have that agreeable lustre which the vulgar
moderns call sore eyes, but the judicious ancients golden
eyes, ocellos Patapanicos.

The process is begun against her Grace of Beaufort,(615) and
articles exhibited in Doctors' Commons.  Lady Townshend has had
them copied, and lent them to me.  There is every thing proved to
your heart's content, to the birth of the child, and much
delectable reading.

Adieu! my dear child; you see I have eked out a letter: I hate
missing a post, and yet at this dead time I have almost been
tempted to invent a murder or a robbery.  But you are good, and
will be persuaded that I have used my eyes and ears for your
service; when, if it were not for you, I should let them lie by
in a drawer from week's end to week's end.  Good night!

(607) An Irish tailor at Florence, who let out ready-furnished
apartments to travelling English.  Lady W. had reported that Lord
Orford was flying from England and would come thither.
(608) George Walpole, afterwards the third Earl of Orford.  He
succeeded to the earldom in 1751, and was appointed
lord-lieutenant and custos rotulorum of the county of Norfolk Mr,
Pitt, in a letter, written in 1759, says, "Nothing could make a
better appearance than the two Norfolk battalions: Lord Orford,
with the port of Mars himself, and really the
genteelest figure under arms I ever saw, was the theme of
every tongue." Chatham Correspondence, vol. ii. p. 4.-E.

(609) George the Second.

(610) Frederic, Prince of Wales.

(611) Dr. Secker, afterwards Bishop of Oxford. (And eventually
Archbishop of Canterbury.  According to Walpole, he was bred a
man-midwife.-D.)  [Secker had committed in Walpole's eyes, the
unpardonable offence of having "procured a marriage between the
heiress of the Duke of Kent and the chancellor's
(Hardwicke's) son;" he, therefore, readily propagated the
charges of his being "a Presbyterian, a man-midwife, and
president of a very freethinking club," (Memoires, i. p. 56,)
when the fact is, the parents of Secker were Dissenters, and he
for a time pursued the study, though not the practice of medicine
and surgery.  The third charge is a mere falsehood.  See also
Quarterly Review, xxv'i. p. 187.]

(612) The Prince was a member of the Saddlers' company.

(613) Hugh Boscawen, second Viscount Falmouth, a great dealer in
boroughs.  It is of him that Lord Dodington tells the
story, that he went to the minister to ask a favour, which the
minister seemed unwilling to grant; upon which Lord Falmouth
said, "Remember, Sir, we are seven."-D.

(614) Author of Love Elegies. [See ant`e, p. 210.)

(615) Frances, daughter and heir of the last Lord Scudamore, wife
of Henry Somerset, Duke of Beaufort; from whom she was divorced
for adultery with Lord Talbot.  She was afterwards married to
Colonel Fitzroy, natural son of the Duke of
Grafton. [The duke Having clearly proved the incontinence of his
wife, obtained a divorce in March 1743-4.)



263 Letter 72
To Sir Horace Mann.
Downing Street, June 14, 1742.

We were surprised last Tuesday with the great good news of the
peace between the Queen and the King of Prussia.  it was so
unexpected and so welcome, that I believe he might get an act of
parliament to forbid any one thinking that he ever made a slip in
integrity.  Then, the reported accounts of the
successes of Prince Charles and Lobkowitz over the French have
put us into the greatest spirits.  Prince charles is extremely
commended for courage and conduct, and makes up a little for
other flaws in the family.

it is at last settled that Lords gower,(616) Cobham, and
Bathurst (617) are to come in.  The first is to be privy-seal,
and was to have kissed hands last Friday, but Lord Hervey had
carried the seal with him to Ickworth; but he must bring it back.
Lord Cobham is to be field-marshal, and to command all the forces
in England.  Bathurst was to have the
Gentleman-pensioners, but Lord Essex,(618) who is now the
Captain, and was to have had the Beef-eaters, will not change.
Bathurst is to have the Beef-eaters; the Duke of Bolton (619) who
has them, is to have the Isle of Wight, and Lord
lymington,(620) who has that, is to have--nothing!

The Secret Committee are in great perplexities about
Scrope:(621) he would not take the oath, but threatened the
Middlesex justices who tendered it to him "Gentlemen," said he,
"have you any complaint against Me?  if you have not,
don't you fear that I will prosecute you for enforcing oaths?"
However, one of them began to read the oath--"I, John
Scrope,"--"I John Scrope:"said he; "I did not say any such thing;
but come, however, let's hear the oath;"--"do promise that I will
faithfully and truly answer all such questions as shall be asked
me by the Committee of Secrecy, and--" they were going on, but
Scrope cried out, "Hold, hold! there is more than I can digest
already."  He then went before the
committee, and desired time to consider.  Pitt asked him
abruptly, if he wanted a quarter of an hour: he replied, "he did
not want to inform either his head or his heart, for both were
satisfied what to do; but that he would ask the King's leave."
He wants to fight Pitt.  He is a most testy little old gentleman,
and about eight years ago would have fought Alderman Perry.  It
was in the House, at the time of the
excise: he said we should carry it: Perry said he hoped to see
him hanged first. "You see me hanged, you dog, you!" said
Scrope, and pulled him by the nose.  The committee have tried all
ways to soften him, and have offered to let him swear to only
what part he pleased, or only with regard to money given to
members of parliament.  Pultney himself has tried to work on him;
but the old gentleman is inflexible, and answered, "that he was
fourscore years old, and did not care whether he spent the few
months he had to live (622) in the Tower or not; that the last
thing he would do should be to betray the King and next to him
the Earl of Orford." It remains in suspense.
The troops continue going to Flanders, but slowly enough.  Lady
Vane has taken a trip thither after a cousin (623) of Lord
Berkeley, who is as simple about her as her own husband is, and
has written to Mr. Knight at Paris to furnish her with what money
she wants.  He says she is vastly to blame; for he was trying to
get her a divorce from Lord Vane, and then would have married her
himself.  Her adventures(624 arc worthy to be bound up with those
of my good sister-in-law,
 as the German Princess, and Moll Flanders.

Whom should I meet in the Park last night but Ceretesi!  He told
me he was at a Bagne.  I will find out his bagnio; for though I
was not much acquainted with him, yet the obligations I had to
Florence make me eager to show any Florentine all the civilities
in my power; though I do not love them near so
well, since what you have told me of their late behaviour;
notwithstanding your letter of June 20th, which I have just
received.  I perceive that simple-hearted, good, unmeaning
Ituccilai is of the number of the false, though you do not
directly say so.

I was excessively diverted with your pompous account of the siege
of Lucca by a single Englishman.  I do believe that you and the
Chutes might put a certain city into as great a panic.  Adieu!

(616) John Leveson Gower, second Lord Gower; in 1746 created an
earl.  He died in 1754.-E.

(617) Allan, first Lord Bathurst, one of the twelve Tory peers
created by Queen Anne, in 1711.  He was the friend of Pope,
Congreve, Swift, Prior, and other men of letters.  He lived to
see his eldest son chancellor of England, and died at the
advanced age of ninety, in 1775; having been created an earl in
1772.-D.

(618) William Capel, third Earl of Essex; ambassador at the court
of Turin. he died in January 1743.  The Beef-eaters are otherwise
called the Yeomen of the Guard.-D.

(619) Charles Powlett, third Duke of Bolton.  His second wife was
Miss Lavinia Fenton, otherwise Mrs. Beswick, the actress; who
became celebrated in the character of Polly Peacham in the
Beggar's Opera.  By her the duke had three sons, born before
marriage.  With his first wife, the daughter and sole heiress of
John Vaughan, Earl of Carberry in Ireland, he never
cohabited.  He died in 1754.-D.

(620) John Wallop, first Viscount Lymington; in the following
April created Earl of Portsmouth.  He died in 1762.-E.

(621) John Scrope, secretary of the treasury.  He had been in
Monmouth's rebellion, when very young, and carried
intelligence to Holland in woman's clothes.

(622) He did not die till 1753.  Tindal states that, upon
giving this answer he was no further pressed.-E.

(623) Henry Berkeley; killed the next year at the battle of
Dettingen.

(624) Lady Vane's Memoirs, dictated by herself, were actually
published afterward,,; in a book, called "The Adventures of
Peregrine Pickle;" and she makes mention of Lady Orford. [See
ant`e, p. 189, Letter 42.  Sir Walter Scott says, that "she not
only furnished Smollett with the materials for recording her own
infamy, but rewarded him handsomely for the insertion of her
story."]




265 Letter 73
To sir Horace Mann.
Midsummer Day, 1742.

One begins every letter with an Io Paean! indeed our hymns are
not so tumultuous as they were some time ago, to the tune of
Admiral Vernon.  They say there came an express last night, of
the taking of Prague and the destruction of some thousand
French.  It is really amazing the fortune of the Queen! We expect
every day the news of the king of Poland having made his peace;
for it is affirmed that the Prussians left him but sixteen days
to think of it.  There is nothing could stop the King of Prussia,
if he should march to Dresden: how long his being at peace with
that king will stop him I look upon as very uncertain.

They say we expect the Report from the Secret Committee next
Tuesday, and then finish.  I preface all my news with "they say;"
for I am not at all in the secret, and I had rather that "they
say" should tell you a lie than myself.  They have sunk the
affair of Scrope: the Chancellor (625) and Sir John
Rushout spoke in the committee against persecuting him, for he is
secretary to the treasury.  I don't think there is so easy a
language as the ministerial in the world-one learns it in a week!
There are few members in town, and most of them no
friends to the committee; so that there is not the least
apprehension of any violence following the Report.  I dare say
there is not; for my uncle, who is my political weather-glass,
and whose quicksilver rises and falls with the least variation of
parliamentary weather, is in great spirits, and has spoken three
times in the House within this week; he had not opened his lips
before since the change.  Mr. Pultney has his warrant in his
pocket for Earl of Bath, and kisses hands as soon as the
parliament rises.  The promotions I mentioned to you are not yet
come to pass; but a
fortnight will settle things wonderfully.

The Italian, (626) who I told you is here, has let me into a
piece of secret history, which you never mentioned: perhaps it is
not true; but he says the mighty mystery of the
Count's (627) elopement from Florence, was occasioned by a letter
from Wachtendonck,(628) which was so impertinent as to talk of
satisfaction for some affront.  The great Count very wisely never
answered it-his life, to be sure, is of too great consequence to
be trusted at the end of a rash German's sword! however, the
General wrote again, and hinted at coming himself for an answer.
So it happened that when he arrived, the Count was gone to the
baths of Lucca-those waters
were reckoned better for his health, than steel in the
abstract-How oddly it happened!  He Just returned to Florence as
the General was dead!  Now was not this heroic lover worth
running after? I wonder, as the Count must have known my
lady's courage and genius for adventures, that he never
thought of putting her in men's clothes, and sending her to
answer the challenge. How pretty it would have been to have
fought for one's lover! and how great the obligation,
when he durst not fight for himself!

I heard the other day, that the Primate of Lorrain was dead of
the smallpox.  Will you make my compliments of condolence?
though I dare say they are little afflicted: he -was a 'most
worthless creature, and all his wit and parts, I believe little
comforted them for his brutality and other vices.

The fine Mr. Pit (629) is arrived: I dine with him
to-day at Lord Lincoln's, with the Pomfrets.  So now the old
partie quarr`ee is complete again.  The earl is not quite
cured,(630) and a partner in sentiments may help to open the
wound again.  My Lady Townshend dines with us too.  She flung the
broadest Wortley-eye (631) on Mr. Pitt, the other night, in the
park!

Adieu! my dear child; are you quite well? I trust the summer will
perfectly re-establish you.

(625) Mr. Sandys, chancellor of the exchequer.

(626) Ceretesi.

(627) Count Richcourt.

(628) General Wachtendonck, commander of the Queen
of Hungary's troops at Leghorn.

(629) George Pitt, of Strathfieldsea: he had
been in love with Lady Charlotte Fermor, second daughter of Lord
Pomfret, who was afterwards married to William Finch,
vice-chamberlain.  (Mr.  Pitt was created Lord Rivers in 1776.
In 1761 he was British envoy at Turin in 1770, ambassador
extraordinary to Spain.  He died in 1803.-D.)

(630) Of his love for lady Sophia Fermor.-D.

(631) Mr. Pitt was very handsome, and Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu had liked him extremely, when he was in Italy.



267 Letter 74
To Sir Horace Mann.
Downing Street, June 30, 1742.

It is about six o'clock, and I am come from the House, where, at
last, we have had another Report from the
Secret Committee.  They have been disputing this week among
themselves, whether this should be final or not.  The new
ministry, thanked them! were for finishing; but their arguments
were not so persuasive as dutiful, and we are to have yet
another.  This lasted two hours and a half in reading, though
confined to the affair of Burrel and Bristow, the Weymouth
election, and secret-service money.  They moved to print it; but
though they had fetched most of their members from Ale and the
country, they were not strong enough to divide.  Velters
Cornwall, whom I have mentioned to you, I believe, for odd
humour, said, "ie believed the somethingness of this report would
make amends for the nothingness of the last, and that he was for
printing it, if it was only from believing that the King would
not see it, unless it is printed." Perhaps it may be printed at
the conclusion; at least it will without authority-and so you
will see it.

I received yours of June 24, N. S. with
one from Mr. Chute, this morning, and I will now go answer it and
Your last.  You seem still to be uneasy about my letters, and
their being retarded.  I have not observed, lately, the same
signs of yours being opened; and for my own, I think it may very
often depend upon the packet-boat and winds.

You ask me if Pultney has lately received any new
disgusts.-How can one answer for a temper so hasty,
so unsettled!-not that I know, unless that he finds, what he has
been twenty years undoing, is not yet undone.

I must interrupt the thread of my answer, to tell you that I hear
news came last night that the States of Holland have voted
forty@seven thousand men for the Assistance of the Queen,(632)
and that it was not doubted but the
States--General would imitate this resolution.  This seems to be
the consequence of the King of Prussia's proceedings-but how can
they trust him so easily?

I am amazed that your leghorn ministry are so wavering; they are
very old style, above eleven days out of fashion, if they any
longer fear the French: my only apprehension is, lest
these successes should make Richcourt more impertinent.

You have no notion how I laughed at the man that "takes
nothing but Madeira."(633)  I told it to my Lady
Pomfret, concluding it would divert her too; and forgetting that
she repines when she should laugh, and reasons when she should be
diverted.  She asked gravely what language that was That Madeira
being subject to an European prince, to be sure they talk some
European dialect!" The grave personage!  It was a piece with her
saying, "that Swift would have written better, if he had never
written ludicrously."

I met a friend of yours the other day at an auction, and
though I knew him not the least, yet being your friend,
and so like you (for, do you know, he is excessively,) I had a
great need to speak to him-and did.  He says, "he has left off
writing to you, for he never could get an answer." I said, you
had never received 'but one from him in all the time I was with
you, and that I was witness to your having Answered it.  He was
with his mother, Lady Abercorn,(634) a most frightful
gentlewoman: Mr. Winnington
says, he one day overheard her and the Duchess of Devonshire
(635) talking of "hideous ugly women!"  By the way, I find I have
never told you that it was Lord Paisley;(636) but that you will
have perceived.

Amorevoli is gone to Dresden for the
summer; our directors are in great fear that he will serve them
like Farinelli, and not return for the winter.

I am writing to you in one of the charming rooms towards the
park: it is a delightful evening, and I am willing to enjoy this
sweet corner while I may, for we are soon to quit it.  Mrs.
Sandys came yesterday to give us warning; Lord Wilmington has
lent it to them.  Sir Robert might have had it for his own at
first, but would only take it as first lord of the
treasury.(637)  He goes into a small house of his own in
Arlington Street, opposite to where we formerly lived.
Whither I shall travel is yet uncertain: he is for my
living with him; but then I shall be cooped-and besides, I never
found that people loved one another the less for living asunder.

The drowsy Lord Mayor (638) is dead-so the
newspapers say.  I think he is not dead, but sleepeth.  Lord
Gower is laid up with the gout: this, they say, is the reason of
his not having the privy seal yet.  The town has talked of
nothing lately but a plot: I will tell you the circumstances.
last week the Scotch hero (639) sent his brother (640) two
papers, which he said had been left at his house by an Unknown
hand; that he believed it was by Colonel Cecil, agent for the
Pretender--though how could that be, for he had had no
conversation with Colonel Cecil for these two years!  He
desired Lord Islay to lay them before the ministry.  One of the
papers seemed a letter, though with no address or
subscription, written in true genuine Stuart characters.  It was
to thank Mr. Burnus (D. of A.) for his services, and that he
hoped he would answer the assurances given of him.  The other was
to command the Jacobites, and to exhort the patriots to continue
what they had mutually so well begun, and to say how pleased he
was with their having removed mr. Tench.  Lord Islay showed these
letters to Lord Orford, and then to the King, and told him he had
showed them to my father. "You did well."-Lord Islay, "Lord
Orford says one is of the Pretender's hand."-King, "He
(641) knows it: whenever any thing of this sort comes to your
hand, carry it to Walpole."  This private conversation you must
not repeat.  A few days afterwards, the Duke wrote to his
brother, "That upon recollection he thought it right to say, that
he had received those letters from Lord Barrimore"(642) who is as
well known for General to the Chevalier, as Montemar is to the
Queen of Spain-or as the Duke of A. would be to either of them.
Lord Islay asked Sir R. if he was against publishing this story,
which he thought was a justification both of his brother and Sir
R. The latter replied, he could certainly have no objection to
its being public-but pray, will his grace's sending these letters
to the secretaries of state Justify him from the assurances that
had been given of' him?(643)  However, the Pretender's being of
opinion that the dismission of Mr. Tench was for his service,
will scarce be an argument to the new ministry for making more
noise about these papers.

I am sorry the boy is so uneasy at being on the foot of a
servant.  I will send for his mother, and ask her why she did not
tell him the conditions to which we had agreed; at the same time,
I will tell her that she may send any letters for him to me.
Adieu! my dear child: I am going to write to Mr. Chute,
that is, to-morrow.  I never was more diverted than with his
letter.

(632) The Queen of Hungary, Maria Theresa.-D.

(633) The only daughter and heiress of the
Marquis Accianoli at Florence, was married to one of the same
name, who was born at Madeira.
'
(634) Anne Plummer, Countess of Abercorn, wife of
James, the seventh earl.  She died in 1756.-E.

(635) Catherine, daughter of John Hoskins, Esq.  She was
married to the third Duke of Devonshire in 171@, and died in
1777.-E.

(636) James Hamilton succeeded as eighth Earl of Abercorn, on the
death of his father in 1743.  He was created Viscount
Hamilton in England in 1786, and died unmarried in 1789.-D.

(637) This is the house, in Downing Street, which is still the
residence of the first lord of the treasury.  George the First
gave it to Baron Bothmar, the Hanoverian minister-, for life.  On
his death, George the Second offered to give it to Sir
Robert Walpole; who, however, refused it, and begged of the King
that it might be attached to the office of first lord of the
treasury.-D.

(638) Sir Robert Godschall.

(639) The Duke of Argyll.

(640) Earl of Islay.

(641) Besides intercepted letters, Sir R. Walpole had more than
once received letters from the Pretender, making him the greatest
offers, which Sir R. always carried to the King, and got him to
endorse, when he
returned them to Sir R.

(642) James Barry, fourth Earl of Barrymore, succeeded his
half-brother Lawrence in the family titles in 1699, and died in
1747, at the age of eighty.  James, Lord Barrymore, was an
adherent of the Pretender, whereas Lawrence had been so great a
supporter of the revolution, that he was attainted, and his
estates sequestered by James the Second's Irish parliament, in
1689.-D.

(643) The Duke of Argyll, in the latter part of his life, was
often melancholy and disordered in his understanding.
After this transaction, and it is supposed he had gone still
farther, he could with difficulty be brought even to write his
name.  The marriage of his eldest daughter with the Earl of
Dalkeith was deferred for some time, because the duke could not
be prevailed upon to sign the writings.




269 Letter 75
To Sir Horace Mann.

On the Death of Richard West, Esq.(644)

While surfeited with life, each hoary knave
Grows, here, immortal, and eludes the grave,
Thy virtues immaturely met their fate,
Cramp'd in the limit of too short a date!


Thy mind, not exercised so oft in vain,
In health was gentle, and composed in pain:
successive trials still refined thy soul,
And plastic Patience perfected the whole.

A friendly aspect, not suborn'd by art;
An eye, which look'd the meaning of thy heart;
A tongue, With simple truth and freedom fraught,
The faithful index of thy honest thought.

Thy pen disdain'd to seek the servile ways
Of partial censure, and more partial praise;
Through every tongue it flowed in nervous ease,
With sense to Polish , and With wit to please.

No lurking venom from thy pencil fell;
Thine was the kindest satire, living well:
The vain, the loose, the base, might blush to see
In what thou wert, what they themselves should be,

Let me not charge on Providence a crime,
Who snatch'd thee, blooming, to a better clime,
To raise those virtues to a higher sphere:
Virtues! which only could have starved thee here;


                         A Receipt To Make A Lord.
             Occasioned by a late report of a promotion.(645)

Take a man, who by nature's a true son of earth,'
By rapine enriched, though a beggar by birth;
In genius the lowest, ill-bred and obscene;
In morals most Wicked, most nasty in mien;
By none ever trusted, yet ever employed;
In blunders quite fertile, in merit quite void;
A scold in the Senate, abroad a buffoon,
The scorn and the jest of all courts but his own:
A slave to that wealth that ne'er made him a friend,
And proud of that cunning that ne'er gain'd an end;
A dupe in each treaty, a Swiss in each vote;
In manners and form, a complete Hottentot.
Such an one could you find, of all men you'd commend him;  But be
sure let the curse of each Briton attend him.
thus fully prepared, add the grace of the throne,
The folly of monarchs, and screen of a crown--
Take a prince for his purpose, without ears or eyes,
And a long parchment roll stuff'd brimful of lies:
These mingled together, a fiat shall pass,
and the thing be a Peer, that before was an ass.

The former copy I think you will like: it was written by one Mr.
Ashton (646) on Mr. West, two friends of mine, whom you have
heard me often mention.  The other copy was printed in the Common
Sense, I don't know by whom composed: the end of it is very bad,
and there are great falsities in it, but some strokes are
terribly like!

I have not a moment to thank the Grifona, nor to answer yours of
June 17, N. S. which I have this instant read.  Yours, in great
haste.

(644) See ante, pp. 121, (Letter 1), 251, (Letter 65).

(645) The report, mentioned in a preceding letter, that Horace
Walpole, brother to Sir Robert, was created a peer.

ant`e, p. 128, Letter 6, footnote 153.)

271 Letter 76
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, July 7, 1742.

Well! you may bid the Secret Committee good night.  The House
adjourns to-day till Tuesday, and on Thursday is to be
prorogued.  Yesterday we had a bill
of Pultney's, about returning officers and regulating
elections: the House was thin, and he carried it by 93 to 92.
Mr. Pelham was not there, and Winnington did not vote, for the
gentleman is testy still; when he saw how near he had been to
losing it, he said loud enough to be heard, "I will make the
gentlemen of that side feel me!" and, rising up, he said, "He
was astonished, that a bill so calculated for the freedom of
elections was so near being thrown out; that there was a
report on the table, which showed how necessary such a bill
was, and that though we had not time this year to consider
what was proper to be done in consequence of it, he hoped we
should next,"-with much to the same purpose; but all the
effect this notable speech had, was to
frighten my uncle, and make him give two or three shrugs
extraordinary to his breeches.  They now say,(647) that
Pultney will not take out the patent for his earldom, but
remain in the House of Commons in terrorem; however, all his
friends are to have places immediately, or, as the fashion of
expressing it is, they are to go to Court in
the Bath coach!"(648)

Your relation Guise (649) is arrived from Carthagena, madder
than ever.  As he was marching up to one of the forts, all his
men deserted him; his lieutenant advised him to
retire; he replied, "He never had turned his back yet, and
would not now," and stood all the fire.  When the pelicans
were flying over his head, he cried out, "What would Chloe
(650) give for some of these to make a
pelican pie!" When he is brave enough to perform such actions
as are really almost incredible, what pity it is that he
should for ever persist In saving things that are totally so!

Lord Annandale (651) is at last mad in all the forms: he has
long been an out-pensioner of Bedlam College.  Lord and Lady
Talbot,(652) are parted; he gives her three thousand pounds
a-year.  Is it not amazing, that in England people will not
find out that they can live separate without parting?  The
Duke of Beaufort says, "He pities Lord Talbot to have met with
two such tempers as their two wives!"

Sir Robert Rich (653) is going to Flanders, to try
to make up an affair for his son; who, having quarrelled with
a Captain Vane, as the commanding officer was trying to make
it up at the head of the regiment, Rich came behind Vane, "And
to show you," said he, "that I will not make it up, take
that," and gave him a box on the ear.  They were immediately
put in arrest; but the learned in the laws of honour say, they
must fight, for no German officer will serve with Vane, till
he has had satisfaction.

Mr. Harris,(654) who married Lady Walpole's mother, is to be
one of the peace-offerings on the new altar.  Bootle is
to be chief-justice; but the Lord Chancellor would not consent
to it, unless Lord Glenorchy,(655) whose daughter is married
to Mr. Yorke, had a place in lieu of the Admiralty, which he
has lost-he is to have Harris's.  Lord Edgecumbe's, in
Ireland, they say, is destined to Harry Vane,(656) Pultney's
toad-eater.

Monticelli lives in a manner at our house.  I tell my sister
that she is in love with him, and that I am glad it was not
Amorevoli.  Monticelli dines frequently with Sir Robert, which
diverts me extremely; you know how low his ideas are of music
and the virtuosi; he calls them all fiddlers.

I have not time now to write more, for I am going to a
masquerade at the Ranelagh amphitheatre: the King is fond of
it, and has pressed people to go; but I don't find that it
will be full.  Good night! All love to the Pope for his good
thing.


(647) Sir R. W. to defeat Pultney's ambition persuaded the
++King to insist on his going into the House of Lords: the
day he carried his patent thither, he flung it upon the floor
in a passion, and could scarce be prevailed on to have it
passed. ["I remember," says Horace Walpole, (Reminiscences),
"my father's action and words when he returned from court, and
told me what he had done - 'I have turned the key of the
closet on him!' making that motion with his
hand."]

(648) His title was to be Earl of Bath.

(649) General Guise, a, very brave officer, but apt to
romance; and a great connoisseur in pictures.  (He bequested
his collection of pictures, which is a very indifferent one,
to christ church College, Oxford.-D.)

(650) the duke of Newcastle's French cook.

(651) George Johnstone, third Marquis of
Annandale, in Scotland.  He was not declared a lunatic till
the year 1748.  Upon his death, in
1792, his titles became either extinct or dormant.-D.

(652) Mary, daughter of Adam de Cardonel,
secretary to John the great Duke of Marlborough, married to
William, second Lord Talbot, eldest son of Lord Chancellor
Talbot.-D.

(653) Sir Robert Rich, Bart., of Rose Hall, Suffolk.  At his
death, in 1768, he was colonel of the fourth regiment of
dragoons, governor of Chelsea Hospital, and field-marshal of
the forces.-E.

(654) This article did not prove true.  Mr. Harris was not
removed, nor Bootle made chief-justice.

(655) John Campbell, Lord Glenorchy, and, on his
father's death, in 1752, third Earl of Breadalbane.  His first
wife was Lady Amiable Grey, eldest daughter and coheir of the
Duke of Kent.  By her he had an only daughter,
Jemima, who, upon the death of her grandfather, became
Baroness Lucas of Crudwell, and Marchioness de Grey.  She
married Philip Yorke, eldest son of the Chancellor
Hardwicke, and eventually himself the second duke of that
title.-D.

(656) Henry Vane, eldest son of Gilbert, second
Lord Barnard, and one of the tribe who came into office upon
the breaking up of Sir Robert Walpole's administration.  He
was created Earl of Darlington in 1753, and died in
1758.-D.




273 Letter 77
To Sir Horace Mann.
Downing Street, July 14, 1742.

Sir Robert Brown(657) is displaced from being paymaster of
something, I forget what, for Sir Charles Gilmour, a friend of
Lord Tweedale.(658)  Nee Finch (659) is made groom
of the bedchamber, which was vacant; and Will Finch (660) vice
chamberlain, which was not vacant; but they have emptied it of
Lord Sidney Beauclerc.(661)  Boone is made commissary-general,
in Hurley's room, and JefFries(662) in Will Stuart's.  All
these have been kissing hands to-day, headed by the Earl of
Bath.  He went into the King the other day ",it this'long
list, but was told shortly, that unless he would take up his
patent and quit the House of Commons,
nothing should be done-he has consented.  I made some of them
very angry; for when they told me who had kissed hands, I
asked, if the Pretender had kissed hands too, for being King?  I
forgot to tell you, that Murray is to be solicitor-general,
in Sir John Strange's place, who is made chief justice, or
some such thing.(663)

I don't know who it was that said it, but it was a very good
answer to one who asked why Lord Gower had not kissed hands
sooner--"the Dispensation was not come
from Rome."(664)

I am writing to you up to the ears in packing: Lord Wilmington
has lent this house to Sandys, and he has given us instant
warning; we are moving as fast as possible to Siberia,-Sir
Robert has a house there, within a few mile,, of the Duke of
Courland; in short, child, we are all going to Norfolk,
till we can get a house ready in town: all the furniture is
taken down, and lying about in confusion.  I look like St.
John in the Isle of Patmos, writing revelations, and
prophesying "Woe! woe! woe! the kingdom of desolation is at
hand!" -indeed, I have prettier animals about me, than he ever
dreamed of: here is the dear Patapan, and a little Vandyke
cat, with black whiskers -ind boots; you would swear it was of
a very ancient family, in the West of England,
famous for their loyalty.

I told you I was going to the masquerade at Ranelagh gardens,
last week: it was miserable; there were but an hundred men,
six women, and two shepherdesses.  The King liked it,--and
that he might not be known, they had dressed him a box with
red damask!  Lady Pomfret and her three daughters were there,
all dressed alike, that they might not be known.  My Lady
said to Lady Bel Finch,(665) who was dressed like a nun, and
for coolness had cut off the nose of her mask, "Madam, you are
the first nun that ever I saw without a nose!"

As I came home last night, they told me there was a fire in
Downing Street; when I came to Whitehall, I could not get to
the end of the street in my chariot, for the crowd; when I got
out, the first thing I heard was a man enjoying himself:
"Well! if it lasts two hours longer, Sir Robert Walpole's
house will be burnt to the ground!"  it was a very comfortable
hearing! but I found the fire was on the opposite side of the
way, and at a good distance.  I stood in the crowd an hour to
hear their discourse: one man was relating at how many fires
he had happened to be present, and did not think himself at
all unlucky in passing by, just at this.  What diverted me
most, was a servant-maid, who was working, and carrying pails
of water, with the strength of half-a-dozen troopers, and
swearing the mob out of her way-the soft creature's name was
Phillis! When I arrived at our door, I found the house
full of goods, beds, women, and children, and three Scotch
members of parliament, who lodge in the row, and who had sent
in a saddle, a flitch of bacon, and a bottle of ink.  There
was no wind, and the house was saved, with the loss of only
its garret, and the furniture.

I forgot to mention the Dominichin last post, as I suppose I
had before, for I always was for buying it; it is one of the
most engaging pictures I ever saw.  I have no qualms about its
originality; and even if Sir Robert should not like
it when it comes, which is impossible, I think I would live
upon a flitch of bacon and a bottle of ink, rather than not
spare the money to buy it myself: so my dear Sir, buy it.

Your brother has this moment brought me a letter: I find by
it, that you are very old style with relation to the Prussian
peace.  Why, we have sent Robinson (666) and Lord Hyndford
(667) a green ribbon, for it, above a fortnight ago.  Muley,
(as Lord Lovel calls him,) Duke of Bedford, (668) is, they
say, to have a blue one, for making his own peace: you know we
always mind home-peaces more than foreign ones.

I am quite sorry for all the trouble you have had about the
Maltese cats; but you know they were for Lord Islay, not for
myself.  Adieu!  I have no more time.

(657) Sir Robert Brown had been a merchant at Venice, and
British resident there, for which he was created a baronet in
1732.  He held the place at this time of" "paymaster of his
Majesty's works, concerning the repairs, new buildings, and
well-keeping of any of his Majesty's houses of access, and
others, in time of progress."-D

(658) John Hay, fourth Marquis of Tweedale.  In 1748, he
married Frances, daughter of John Earl Granville, and died in
1762.-E.

(659) The Hon.  Edward Finch, fifth son of Daniel, sixth Earl
of Winchilsea and second Earl of Nottingham, and the direct
ancestor of the present Lord Winchilsea.  He assumed the name
of Hatton, in 1764, in consequence of inheriting the fortune
of William Viscount Hatton, his mother's brother.  He was
employed in diplomacy, and was made master of the robes in
1757.  He died in 1771.-D.

(660) The Hon. William Finch, second son of Daniel, sixth Earl of
Winchilsea, had been envoy in Sweden and in Holland.  He
continued to hold the office of vice-chamberlain of the
household till his death in 1766.  These two brothers, and
their elder brother Daniel, seventh Earl of Winchilsea, are
the persons whom Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, calls, on
account of the blackness of their complexions, "the dark,
funereal
Finches."  [His widow, Charlotte, daughter of the Earl of
Pomfret,
was appointed governess to the young princes and princesses.]

(661) Lord Sidney Beauclerk, fifth son of the first Duke of
St. Albans; a man of bad character.  Sir Charles Hanbury
Williams calls him "Worthless Sidney." He was notorious for
hunting after the fortunes of the old and childless.  Being
very handsome, he had almost persuaded Lady Betty Germain, in
her old age, to marry him; but she was dissuaded from it by
the Duke of Dorset and her relations.  He failed also in
obtaining
the fortune of Sir' Thomas Reeve, Chief Justice of the (common
Pleas, whom he used to attend on the circuit, with a view of
ingratiating himself with him.  At length he induced Mr.
Topham, of Windsor, to leave his estate to him.  He died in
1744, leaving one son, Topham Beauclerk,
Esq.-D. [This son, so celebrated for his conversational,
talents, and described by Dr. Jonson as uniting the eloquent
manners of a gentleman with the mental acccomplishments of a
scholar, married, in 1768, Lady Diana Spencer, daughter of the
Duke of Marlborough, and died in 1780.]

(662) John JefFries, secretary of the treasury.-D.


(663) Sir John Strange was made master of the rolls, but not
till some years afterwards; he died in 1754.

(664) From the Pretender.  Lord Gower had been, until he was
made privy-seal, one of the leading Jacobites; and was even
supposed to lean to that party, after he had accepted the
appointment.

(665) Lady Isabella Finch, third daughter of the sixth Earl of
Winchilsea, first lady of the bedchamber to the Princess
Amelia.  It was for her that Kent built the pretty and
singular house on the western side of Berkeley Square, with a
fine room in it, of which the ceiling is painted in arabesque
compartments, by Zucchi;-now the residence of C. B. Wall,
Esq.-D. [In this house her ladyship died unmarried, in 1771.)

(666) Sir Thomas Robinson, minister at Vienna; be was made
secretary of state in 1754.  (And a peer, by the title of Lord
Grantham, in 1761.-D.)

(667) John Carmichael, third Earl of Hyndford.  He had been
sent as envoy to the King of Prussia, during the first war of
Silesia.  He was afterwards sent ambassador to St. Petersburgh
and Vienna, and died in 1767.-D.

(668) The Duke of Bedford had not the
Garter till some years after this.



275 Letter 78
To Sir Horace Mann.

You scolded me so much about my little paper, that I dare not
venture upon it even now, when I have very little to say to
you.  The long session is over, and the Secret Committee
already forgotten.  Nobody remembers it but poor Paxton, who
has lost his place(669)  by it.  saw him the day after he came
out of Newgate: he came to Chelsea:(670) Lord Fitzwilliam was
there, and in the height of zeal, took him about the neck and
kissed him.  Lord Orford had been at Court that morning, and
with his usual spirits, said to the new ministers, "So! the
parliament is up, and Paxton, Bell, and I have got our
liberty!"  The King spoke in the kindest manner to him at his
levee, but did not call him into the closet, as the new
ministry feared he would, and as perhaps, the old ministry
expected he would.  The day before, when the King went to put
an end to the session, Lord Quarendon asked Winnington
"whether Bell would be let out time enough to hire a mob to
huzza him as he went to the House of Lords."

The few people that are left in town have been much diverted
with an adventure that has befallen the new ministers.  Last
Sunday the Duke of Newcastle gave them a dinner at Claremont,
where their servants got so drunk, that when they came to the
inn over against the gate of Newpark,(671) the coachman, who
was the only remaining fragment of their suite, tumbled off
the box, and there they were planted.  There were Lord Bath,
Lord Carteret, Lord Limerick, and Harry Furnese (672) in the
coach: they asked the innkeeper if he could contrive no way to
convey them to town. , No," he said, "not unless it was to get
Lord Orford's coachman to drive them." They demurred; but Lord
Carteret said "Oh, I dare say, Lord Orford will willingly let
us have him."  So they sent and he drove them home.(673)

Ceretesi had a mind to see this wonderful Lord Orford, of whom
he had heard so much; I carried him to dine at Chelsea.  You
know the earl don't speak a word of any language but English
and Latin,(674) and Ceretesi not a word of either; yet he
assured me that he was very happy to have made cosi bella
conascenza!  He whips out his pocket-book every moment, and
writes descriptions in issimo of every thing he sees: the
grotto alone took up three pages.  What volumes he will
publish at his return, in usum Serenissimi Pannom!(675)

There has lately been the most shocking scene of murder
imaginable; a parcel of drunken constables took it into their
heads to put the laws in execution against disorderly persons,
and so took up every woman they met, till they had collected
five and six or twenty, all of whom they thrust into St.
Martin's roundhouse, where they kept them all night, with
doors and windows closed.  The poor creatures, who could not
stir or breathe, screamed as long as they had any breath left,
begging at least for water: one poor wretch said she was worth
eighteen-pence, and would gladly give it for a draught of
water, but in vain! So well did they keep them there, that in
the morning four were found stifled to death, two died soon
after, and a dozen more are in a shocking way.  In short, it
is horrid to think what the poor creatures suffered: several
of them were beggars, who, from having no lodging, were
necessarily found in the street, and others honest labouring
women.  One of the dead was a poor washerwoman, big with
child, who was returning home late from washing.  One of the
constables is taken, and others absconded; but I question(676)
if any of them will suffer death, though the greatest
criminals in this town are the officers of justice; there is
no tyranny they do not exercise, no villainy of which they do
not partake.  These same men, the same night, broke into a
bagnio in Covent-Garden, and took up Jack Spencer,(677) Mr.
Stewart, and Lord George Graham,(678) and would have thrust
them into the round-house with the poor women, if they had not
been worth more than eighteen-pence!

I have just now received yours of the 15th of July, with a
married letter from both Prince and Princess:(679) but sure
nothing ever equalled the setting out of it! She says, "The
generosity of your friendship for me, Sir, leaves me nothing
to desire of all that is precious in England, China, and the
Indies!" Do you know, after such a testimony under the hand of
a princess, that I am determined, after the laudable example
of the house of Medici, to take the title of Horace the
Magnificent! I am only afraid it should be a dangerous example
for my posterity, who may ruin themselves in emulating the
magnificence of their ancestor.  It happens comically, for the
other day, in removing from Downing-street, Sir Robert found
an old account-book of his father, wherein he set down all
his, expenses.  In three months and ten days that he was in
London one winter as member of parliament, he spent-what do
you think?-sixty-four pounds seven shillings and five-pence!
There are many articles for Nottingham ale, eighteen-pences
for dinners, five shillings to Bob (now Earl of Orford), and
one memorandum of six shillings given in exchange to Mr.
Wilkins for his wig-and yet this old man, my grandfather, had
two thousand pounds a-year, Norfolk sterling!  He little
thought that what maintained him for a whole session, would
scarce serve one of his younger grandsons to buy japan and
fans for princesses at Florence!

Lord Orford has been at court again to-day: Lord Carteret came
up to thank him for his coachman; the Duke of Newcastle
standing by. My father said, "My lord, whenever the duke is
near overturning you, you have nothing to do but to send to
me, and I will save you." The duke said to Lord Carteret, "Do
you know, my lord, that the Venison you eat that day came out
of Newpark?"  Lord Orford laughed, and said, "So, you see I am
made to kill the fatted calf for the return of the prodigals!"
The King passed by all the new ministry to speak to him, and
afterwards only spoke to my Lord Carteret.

Should I answer the letters from the court of Petraria again?
there will be no end of our magnificent correspondence!-but
would it not be too haughty to let a princess write last?

Oh, the cats! I can never keep them, and yet It is barbarous
to send them all to Lord Islay: he will shut them up and
starve them, and then bury them under the stairs with his
wife.  Adieu!

(669) Solicitor to the treasury.  See ante, p. 246.

(670) Sir R. Walpole's house at Chelsea.-D.

(671) Lord Walpole was ranger of Newpark.  (Now called
Richmond Park.-D.)

(672) One of the band of incapables who obtained power and
place on the fall of Walpole.  Horace Walpole, in his
Memoires, calls him "that old rag of Lord Bath's quota to an
administration, the mute Harry Furnese."-D.

(673) This occurrence was celebrated in a ballad which is
inserted in C. Hanbury Williams's works, and begins thus.

"As Caleb and Carteret, two birds of a feather,
Went down to a feast at Newcastle's together."

Lord Bath is called "Caleb," in consequence of the name of
Caleb DAnvers having been used in The Craftsman, of which he
was the principal author.-D.

(674) It was very remarkable that Lord Orford could get and
keep such an ascendant with King George 1. when they had no
way of conversing but very imperfectly in Latin.

(675) The coffee-house at Florence where the nobility meet.

(676) The keeper of the round-house was tried but acquitted of
wilful murder. [The keeper, whose name was William Bird, was
tried at the Old Bailey in October, and received sentence of
death; which was afterwards transmuted to transportation.]

(677) The Honourable John Spencer, second son of Charles,
third Earl of Sunderland, by Anne his wife, second daughter of
the great Duke of Marlborough.  He was the favourite grandson
of old Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough who left him a vast
fortune, having disinherited, to the utmost of her power, his
eldest brother, Charles, Duke of Marlborough.  The condition
upon which she made this bequest was that neither he nor his
heirs should take any place or pension from any government,
except the rangership of Windsor Park.  He was the ancestor of
the present Earl Spencer, and died in 1746.- D.

(678) Lord George Graham, youngest son of the Duke of
Montrose, and a captain in the navy.  He died in 1747.-D.

(679) Prince and Princess Craon.




278 Letter 79
To Sir Horace Mann.
Chelsea, July 29, 1742.

I am quite out of humour; the whole town is melted away; you
never saw such a desert.  You know what Florence is in the
vintage-season, at least I remember what it was: London is
just as empty, nothing but half-a-dozen private gentlewomen
left, who live upon the scandal that they laid up in the
winter.  I am going too! this day se'nnight we set out for
Houghton, for three months; but I scarce think that I shall
allow thirty days apiece to them.  Next post I shall not be
able to write to you; and when I am there shall scarce find
any materials to furnish a letter above every other post.  I
beg, however, that you will write constantly to me: it will be
my only entertainment, for I neither hunt, brew, drink, nor
reap.  When I return in the winter, I will make amends for
this barren season of our correspondence.

I carried Sir Robert the other night to Ranelagh for the first
time: my uncle's prudence, or fear, would never let him go
before.  It was pretty full, and all its fulness flocked round
us: we walked with a train at our heels, like two chairmen
going to fight; but they were extremely civil, and did not
crowd him, or say the least impertinence--I think he grows
popular already!  The other day he got it asked, whether he
should be received if he went to Carleton House?-no,
truly!-but yesterday morning Lord Baltimore' came (680) to
soften it a little; that his royal highness -did not refuse to
see him, but that now the Court was out of town, and he had no
drawing-room, he did not see any body.

They have given Mrs. Pultney an admirable name, and one that
is likely to stick by her-instead of Lady Bath, they call her
the wife of Bath.(681)  Don't you figure her squabbling at the
gate with St. Peter for a halfpenny.

Cibber has published a little pamphlet against Pope, which has
a great deal of spirit, and, from some circumstances, will
notably vex him.(682)  I will send it to you by the first
opportunity, with a new pamphlet, said to be Doddington's,
called "A Comparison of the Old and New Ministry:" it is much
liked.  I have not forgot your magazines, but will send them
and these pamphlets together.  Adieu! I am at the end of my
tell.

P. S. Lord Edgecumbe is just made lord-lieutenant of Cornwall,
at which the Lord of Bath looks sour. He said, yesterday, that
the King would give orders for several other considerable
alterations; but gave no orders, except for this, which was
not asked by that earl.

(680) Lord of the bedchamber to the Prince.

(681) In allusion to the old ballad.

(682) This pamphlet, which was entitled "A Letter from Mr.
Cibber to Mr. Pope; inquiring into the motives that might
induce him, in his satirical works to be so frequently fond of
Mr. Cibber's name," so "notably vexed" the great poet, that,
in a new edition of the Dunciad, he dethroned Theobald from
his eminence as King of the dunces, and enthroned Cibber in
his stead.-E.




279 Letter 80
To Sir Horace Mann.
(From Houghton.)

Here are three new ballads,(683) and you must take them as a
plump part of a long letter.  Consider, I am in the barren
land of Norfolk, where news grows as slow as any thing green;
and besides, I am in the house of a fallen minister!  The
first song I fancy is Lord Edgcumbe's; at least he had reason
to write it.  The second I do not think so good as the real
Story that occasioned it.  The last is reckoned vastly the
best, and is much admired: I cannot say I see all those
beauties in it, nor am charmed with the poetry, which is cried
up. I don't find that any body knows whose it is.(684) Pultney
is very anoyed, especially as he pretends, about his wife, and
says, "it is too much to abuse ladies!"  You see, their twenty
years' satires come back home!  He is gone to the Bath in
great dudgeon: the day before he went, he went in to the King
to ask him to turn out Mr. Hill of the customs, for having
opposed him at Heydon.  "Sir," said the King, "was it not when
you was opposing me? I won't turn him out: I will part with no
more of my friends." Lord Wilmington was waiting to receive
orders accordingly, but the King gave him none.

We came hither last Saturday; as we passed through
Grosvenor-square, we met Sir Roger Newdigate, (685) with a
vast body of Tories, proceeding to his election at Brentford:
we might have expected some insult, but only one single fellow
hissed. and was not followed.  Lord Edgcumbe, Mr. Ellis, and
Mr. Hervey, in their way to Coke's,(686)
and Lord Chief Justice Wills (on the circuit) are the Only
company here yet.  My Lord invited nobody, but left it to
their charity.  The other night, as soon as he had gone
through showing Mr. Wills the house, Well," said he, "here I
am to enjoy  't, and my Lord of Bath may--."  I forgot to tell
you, in confirmation of what you see in the song of the wife
of Bath having shares of places, Sir Robert told me, that when
formerly she got a place for her own father, she took the
salary and left him only the perquisites!

It is much thought that the King will go abroad, if he can avoid
leaving the Prince in his place--.  Imagine all this!

I received to-day yours of July 21), and two from Mr. Chute
and Madame Pucci,(687) which I will answer very soon: where is
she now?  I delight in Mr. Villiers's, (688) modesty-in one
place you had written it villette's; I fancy on purpose, for
it would do for him.

Good night, my dear child! I have written myself threadbare.
I know you will hate my campaign, but what can one do!

(683) As these ballads are to be found in the edition of Sir
Charles Hanbury Williams's works, published in 1822, it has
been deemed better to omit them here.  They are called,
"Labour in Vain," "The Old Coachman," and "The Country
Girl."-D.

(684) it was written by Hanbury Williams.

(685) Sir Roger Newdigate, the fifth baronet of the family.
He was elected member for Middlesex, upon the vacancy
occasioned by Pultney's being created Earl of Bath.  He
belonged to the Tory or Jacobite party.-D. [Sir Roger
afterwards represented the University of Oxford in five
parliaments, and died in 1806, in his eighty-seventh year.
Among other benefactions to his Alma Mater, he gave the noble
candelabra in the Radcliffe library, and founded an annual
prize
 for English verses on ancient painting, sculpture, and
architecture.]

(686) Holkham.  Coke was the son of Lord Lovel, afterward
Viscount Coke, when his father was created Earl of
Leicester.-D.

(687) She was the daughter of the Conte di Valvasone, of
Friuli, sister of Madame Suares, and of the bedchamber to the
Duchess of Modena.

(688) Thomas Villiers a younger son of william, second Earl of
Jersey, at this time British minister at the court of Dresden,
and eventually created Lord Hyde, and Earl of clarendon.  Sir
H. Mann had alluded in one of his letters to a speech
attributed to Mr. Villiers, in which he took great credit to
himself for having induced the King of Poland to become a
party to the peace of Breslau, recently concluded between the
Queen of Hungary and the King, of Prussia; a course of
proceeding, which, in fact, his Polish Majesty had no
alternative but to adopt.  Villettes was an inferior
diplomatic agent from England to some of the Italian courts,
and was at this moment resident at the court of Turin.-D.




280 Letter 81
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, Aug. 20, 1742


By the tediousness of the post, and distance of place, I am
still receiving letters from you about the Secret Committee,
which seems strange, for it is as much forgotten now, as if it
had happened in the last reign.  Thus much I must answer you
about it, that it is possible to resume the inquiry upon the
Report next session; but you may judge whether they will,
after all the late promotions.

We are willing to believe that there are no news in town, for
we hear none at all: Lord Lovel sent us word to-day, that he
heard, by a messenger from the post office, that Montemar
(689) is put under arrest.  I don't tell you this for news,
for you must know it long ago: but I expect the confirmation
of it from you next post.  Since we came hither I have heard
no more of the king's journey to Flanders: our troops are as
peaceable there as On Hounslow Heath, except some bickerings
and blows about beef with butchers, and about sacraments with
friars.  You know the English can eat no meat, nor be civil to
any God but their own.

As much as I am obliged to you for the description of your
Cocchiata,(690) I don't like to hear of it.  It is very
unpleasant, instead of being at it, to be prisoner, in a
melancholy, barren province, which would put one in mind of
the deluge, only that we have no water.  Do remember exactly
how your last was; for I intend that you shall give me just
such another Cocchiata next summer, if it pleases the kings
and queens of this world to let us be at peace For "it rests
that without fig-leaves," as my Lord Bacon says in one of his
letters , "I do ingenuously confess and acknowledge," (691)
that I like nothing so well as Italy.

I agree with you extremely about Tuscany for Prince
Charles,(692) but I can only agree with you on paper; for as
to knowing anything of it, I am sure Sir Robert himself knows
nothing of it: the Duke of Newcastle and my Lord Carteret keep
him in as great ignorance as possible, especially the latter;
and even in other times, you know how little he ever thought
on those things.  Believe me, he will every day know less.

Your last, which I have been answering, was the. 5th of
August; I this minute receive another of the 12th.  How I am
charmed with your spirit and usage of Richcourt!  Mais ce
n'est pas d'aujourdhui que je commence `a les m`epriser!  I am
so glad that you have quitted your calm, to treat them as they
deserve.  You don't tell me if his opposition in the council
hindered your intercession from taking place for the valet de
chambre.  I hope not! I could not bear his thwarting you!

I am now going to write to your brother, to get you the
overtures; and to desire he will send them with some pamphlets
and the magazines which I left in commission for you, at my
leaving London.  I am going to send him, too, des pleins
pouvoirs, for nominating a person to represent me at his new
babe's christening.

I am sorry Mrs. Goldsworthy is coming to England, though I
think it can be of no effect.  Sir Charles (692) has no sort
of interest with the new powers, and I don't think the
Richmonds have enough to remove foreign ministers.  However, I
will consult with Sir Robert about it, and see if he thinks
there is any danger for you, which I do not in the least; and
whatever can be done by me, I think you know, will.

P. S. I inclose an answer to Madame Pucci's letter.  Where is
she in all this Modenese desolation

(689) Montemar was the General of the King of Spain, who
commanded the troops of that sovereign against the
Imperialists in Italy.-D.

(690) A sort of serenade.  Sir H. Mann had mentioned, that he
was about to give an entertainment of this kind in his garden
to the society of Florence.-D.

(691) Prince Charles of Lorraine, younger brother of Francis,
who was now Grand Duke of Tuscany.  He was a general of some
abilities; but it was his misfortune to be so often opposed to
the superior talents of the King of Prussia.-D.

(692) Sir Charles Wager.



281 Letter 82
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, August 28, 1742.

I did receive your letter of the 12th, as I think I mentioned
in my last; and to-day another of the 19th.  Had I been you,
instead of saying that I would have taken my lady's(693) woman
for my spy, I should have said, that I would hire Richcourt
himself: I dare to say that one might buy the count's own
secrets of himself.

I am sorry to hear that the Impressarii have sent for the
Chiaretta; I am not one of the managers; I should have
remonstrated against her, for she will not do on the same
stage with the Barbarina.  I don't know who will be glad of
her coming, but Mr. Blighe and Amorevoli.

'Tis amazing, but we hear not a syllable of Prague taken,(694)
it must be!  Indeed, Carthagena, too, was certain of being
taken! but it seems, Maillebois is to stop at Bavaria.  I hope
Belleisle (695) will be made prisoner?  I am indifferent about
the fate of the great Broglio-but Belleisle is able, and is
our most determined enemy: we need not have more, for to-day
it is confirmed that Cardinal Tencin (696) and M. d'Argenson
are declared of the prime ministry.  The first moment they
can, Tencin will be for transporting the Pretenders into
England.  Your advice about Naples was quite judicious: the
appearance of a bomb will have great weight in the councils of
the little king.

We don't talk now of any of the Royals passing into Flanders;
though the Champion (697) this morning had an admirable
quotation, on the supposition that the King would go himself:
it was this line from the Rehearsal:-

"Give us our fiddle; we ourselves will play."

The lesson for the Day (698) that I sent you, I gave to Mr.
Coke, who came in as I was writing it, and by his dispersing
it, it has got into print, with an additional one, which I
cannot say I am proud should go under my name.  Since that,
nothing but lessons are the fashion: first and second lessons,
morning and evening lessons, epistles, etc.  One of the Tory
papers published so abusive an one last week on the new
ministry, that three gentlemen called on the printer, to know
how he dared to publish it.  Don't you like these men who for
twenty years together led the way, and published every thing
that was scandalous, that they should wonder at any body's
daring to publish against them! Oh! it will come home to them!
Indeed, every body's fame now is published at length: last
week the Champion mentioned the Earl of Orford and his natural
daughter, Lady Mary, at length (for which he had a great mind
to prosecute the printer).  To-day, the London Evening Post
says, Mr. Pane, nephew of Mr. Scrope, is made first clerk of
the treasury, as a reward for his uncle's taciturnity before
the Secret Committee.  He is in the room of old Tilson, who
was so tormented by that Committee that it turned his brain,
and he is dead.

I am excessively shocked at Mr. Fane's (699) behaviour to you;
but Mr. Fane is an honourable man! he lets poor you pay him
his salary for eighteen months, without thinking of returning
it! But if he had lost that sum to Jansen,(700) or to any of
the honourable men at White's, he would think his honour
engaged to pay it.  There is nothing, sure, so whimsical as
modern honour! You may debauch a woman upon a promise of
marriage, and not marry her; you may ruin your tailor's or
your baker's family by not paying them; you may make Mr. Mann
maintain you for eighteen months, as a public minister, out of
his own pocket, and still be a man of honour! But, not to pay
a common sharper, or not to murder a man that has trod upon
your toe, is such a blot in your scutcheon, that you could
never recover your honour, though you had in your veins "all
the blood of all the Howards!"

My love to Mr. Chute: tell him, as he looks on the east front
of Houghton, to tap under the two windows in the left-hand
wing, up stairs, close to the colonnade-there are Patapan and
I, at this instant, writing to you; there we are almost every
morning, or in the library; the evenings, we walk till dark;
then Lady Mary, Miss Leneve, and I play at comet; the Earl,
Mrs. Leneve, and whosoever is here, discourse; car telle est
notre vie!  Adieu!

(693) Lady Walpole.  Richcourt, the Florentine minister, was
her lover, and both, as has been seen in the former part of
these letters, were enemies of Sir . H. Mann.-D.

(694) This means retaken by the Imperialists from the French,
who had obtained possession of it on the 25th of November,
1741.  The Austrian troops drove the French out of Prague, in
December, 1742.-D.

(695) This wish was gratified, though not in this year.
Marshal Belleisle was taken prisoner in 1745, by the
Hanoverian dragoons, was confined for some months in Windsor
Castle, and exchanged after the battle of Fontenoy.-D.

(696) A profligate ecclesiastic, who was deeply engaged in the
corrupt political intrigues of the day.  In these he was
assisted by his sister Madame Tencin, an unprincipled woman of
much ability, who had been the mistress of the still more
infamous Cardinal Dubois.  Voltaire boasts in his Memoirs, of
having killed the Cardinal Tencin from vexation, at a sort of
political hoax, which he played off upon him.-D. [The cardinal
was afterwards, made Archbishop of Lyons.  In 1752, he
entirely quitted the court, and retired to his diocese, where
he died in 1758, ,greatly esteemed," says the Biog. Univ.  for
his extensive charities." His sister died in 1749.  She was
mother of the celebrated D'Alembert by Destouches Canon, and
authoress of "Le Comte de Comminges," "Les Malheurs de
l'Amour," and other romances.]

(697) 'The Champion was an opposition Journal, written by
Fielding. [Assisted by Ralph, the historian.)

(698) Entitled " The Lessons for the Day, 1742." Published in
Sir Charles Hanbury Williams's works, but written by
Walpole.-D.

(699) Charles Fane, afterwards Lord Fane, had been minister at
Florence before Mr. Mann.

(700) A notorious gambler.  He is mentioned by Pope, in the
character of the young man of fashion, in the fourth canto of
the Dunciad,

"As much estate, and principle, and wit,
As Jansen, Fleetwood, Cibber, shall think fit."-D.




284 Letter 83
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, Sept. 11, 1742.

I could not write     to you last week, for I was at
Woolterton,(701) and in a course of visits, that took up my
every moment.  I received one from you there, of August 26th,
but have had none at all this week.

You know I am not prejudiced in favour of the country, nor
like a place because it bears turnips well, or because you may
gallop over it without meeting a tree: but I really was
charmed with Woolterton; it is all wood and water! My uncle
and aunt may, without any expense, do what they have all their
lives avoided, wash themselves and make fires.(702)  Their
house is more than a         good one; if they had not saved
eighteen pence in every room, it would have been a fine one.
I saw several of my acquaintance,(703)  Volterra vases,
Grisoni landscapes, the four little bronzes, the
raffle-picture, etc.

We have printed about the expedition to Naples: the affair at
Elba, too, is in the papers, but we affect not to believe it.
 We are in great apprehensions of not taking Prague--the only
thing that has been taken on our side lately, I think, is my
Lord Stair's journey hither and back again-we don't know for
what-he is such an Orlando! The papers are full of the most
defending King'S Journey to Flanders;our private letters say
not a word of it-I say our, for at                  present I
think the earl's intelligences and mine are pretty equal as to
authority.

Here is a little thing which I think has humour in it.

Adieu! my dear child; if it was not for this secret of
transcribing, what should one do in the country to make out a
letter?



285 Letter 84
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, Sept. 25th, 1742.

At last, my dear child, I have got two letters from you! I
have been in strange pain, between fear of your being ill, and
apprehensions of your letters being stopped; but I have
received that by Crew, and another since.  But you have been
ill! I am angry with Mr. Chute for not writing to let me know
it.  I fancied you worse than you say, or at least than you
own.  But I don't wonder you have fevers!  such a busy
politician as Villettes,(704) and such a blustering negotiator
as il Furibondo (705) are enough to put all your little
economy of health and spirits in confusion.  I agree with you,
that " they don't pique themselves upon understanding sense,
any more than Deutralities!"  The grand journey to
Flanders(706) is a little -it a stand: the expense has been
computed at two thousand pounds a day! Many dozen of
embroidered portmanteaus full of laurels and bays have been
prepared this fortnight.  The Regency has been settled and
unsettled twenty times: it is now said, that the weight of it
is not to be laid on the Prince.  The King is to return by his
birthday; but whether he is to bring back part of French
Flanders with him, or will only have time to fetch Dunkirk, is
uncertain.  In the mean time, Lord Carteret is gone to the
Hague; by which jaunt it seems that Lord Stair's journey was
not conclusive.  The converting of the siege of Prague into a
blockade makes no great figure in the journals on this side
the water and question-but it is the fashion not to take towns
that one was sure of taking.  I cannot pardon the Princess for
having thought of putting off her `epuisements and lassitudes
to take a trip to Leghorn, "pendant qu'on ne donnoit `a manger
`a Monsieur le Prince son fils, que de la chair de chevaux!"
Poor Prince Beauvau!(707)  I shall be glad to hear he is safe
from this siege.  Some of the French princes of the blood have
been stealing away a volunteering, but took care to be missed
in time.  Our Duke goes with his lord and father-they say, to
marry a princess of Prussia, whereof great preparations have
been making in his equipage and in his breeches.

Poor Prince Craon! where did De Sade get fifty sequins.  When
I was at Florence, you know all his clothes were in pawn to
his landlord; but he redeemed them by pawning his Modenese
bill of credit to his landlady! I delight in the style of the
neutrality maker(708)-his neutralities and his English arc
perfectly of a piece.

You have diverted me excessively with the history of the
Princess Eleonora's(709) posthumous issue-but how could the
woman have spirit enough to have five children by her footman,
and yet not have enough to own them.  Really, a woman so much
in the great world should have known better! Why, no yeoman's
dowager could have acted more prudishly! It always amazes me,
when I reflect on the women, who are the first to propagate
scandal of one another.  If they would but agree not to
censure what they all agree to do, there would be no more loss
of characters among them than amongst men.  A woman cannot
have an affair, but instantly all her sex travel about to
publish it, and leave her off: now, if a man cheats another of
his estate at play, forges a will, or marries a ward to his
own son, nobody thinks of leaving him off for such trifles.

The English parson at Stosch's, the archbishop on the chapter
of music, the Fanciulla's persisting in her mistake, and old
Count Galli's distress, are all admirable stories.(710)  But
what is the meaning of Montemar's writing to the Antinora?--I
thought he had left the Galia for my illustrissima,(711) her
sister.  lord! I am horridly tired of that romantic love and
correspondence! Must I answer her last letter?  there were but
six lines--what can I say? I perceive, by what you mention of
the cause of his disorder, that Rucellai does not turn out
that simple, honest man you thought him-come, own it

I just recollect a story, which perhaps will serve your
archbishop on his Don Pilogio(712)-the Tartuffe was meant for
the then archbishop of Paris, who, after the first night,
forbad its being acted.  Moliere came forth, and told the
audience, "Messieurs, on devoit vous donner le Tartuffe, mais
MOnSeigneur l'Archev`eque ne veut pas qu'on le joue."

My lord is very impatient for his Dominichin; so you will send
it by the first safe conveyance.  He is making a gallery, for
the ceiling of which I have given the design of that in the
little library of St. Mark at Venice: Mr. Chute will remember
how charming it was; and for the frieze, I have prevailed to
have that of the temple at Tivoli.  Naylor(713) came here the
other day with two coaches full of relations: as his
mother-in-law, who was one of the company is widow of Dr.
Hare, Sir Robert's old tutor at Cambridge, he made them stay
to dine: when they were gone, he said, "Ha, child! what is
that Mr. Naylor, Horace  ? he is the absurdest man I ever
saw!" I subscribed to his opinion; won't you?  I must tell you
a story of him.  When his father married this second wife,
Naylor said,"Father, they say you are to be married to-day,
are you?"  "Well," replied the bishop, "and what is that to
you?"  "Nay, nothing; only if you had told me, I would have
powdered my hair."

(704) Mr. Villettes was minister at Turin.

(705) Admiral Matthews; his ships having committed some
outrages on the coast of Italy, the Italians called him it
Furibondo.

(706) Of George the Second.-D.

(707) Afterwards a marshal of France. He was a man of some
ability, and the friend and patron of St. Lambert, and of
other men of letters of the time of Lewis XV.-D.  [He was made
a marshal in 1783 by the unfortunate Louis XVI. and in 1789 a
minister of state.  He died in 1793, a few weeks after the
murder of his royal master.]

(708) Admiral Matthews.

(709) Eleonora of Guastalla, widow of the last cardinal of
Medici, died at Venice. (The father of the children was a
French running footman.-D.) [Cosmo the Third was sixty-seven
years old at the period of the marriage: "une fois le marriage
conclu," says the Biog. Univ. "El`eonore refusa de la
consommer, rebut`ee par la figure, par l'age et surtout par
les d`esordres de son `epouse."  Cosmo died at the age of
eighty-one. A translation of his Travels through England, in
1669, was published in 1820.

(710) These are stories in a letter of Sir H. Mann's, which
are neither very decent nor very amusing.-D.

(711) Madame Grifoni.

(712) The Archbishop of Florence had forbid the acting of a
burlettae called Don Pilogio, a sort of imitation of Tartuffe.
When the Impresario of the Theatre remonstrated upon the
expense he had been put to in preparing the music for it, the
archbishop told him he might use it for some other opera.-D.

(713) He was the son of Dr. Here, Bishop of Chichester, and
changed his name for an estate.




                            287 Letter 85
          To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, Oct. 8th, 1742.

I have not heard from you this fortnight; if I don't receive a
letter to-morrow, I shall be quite out of humour.  It is true,
of late I have written to you but every other post; but then I
have been in the country, in Norfolk, in Siberia!  You were
still at Florence, in the midst of Kings of Sardinia,
Montemars, and Neapolitan neutralities; your letters are my
only diversion.  As to German news, it is all so simple that I
am peevish: the raising of the siege of Prague,((714) and
Prince Charles and Marechal Maillebois playing at hunt the
squirrel, have disgusted me from inquiring about the war.  The
earl laughs in his great chair, and sings a bit of an old
ballad,

"They both did fight, they both did beat, they both did run
     away,
They both strive again to meet, the quite contrary way."


Apropos! I see in the papers that a Marquis de Beauvau escaped
out of Prague with the Prince de Deuxpons and the Duc de
Brissac; was it our Prince Beauvau?

At last the mighty monarch does not go to Flanders, after
making the greatest preparations that ever were made but by
Harry the Eighth, and the authors of the grand Cyrus and the
illustrious Hassa: you may judge by the quantity of napkins,
which were to the amount of nine hundred dozen-indeed, I don't
recollect that ancient heroes were ever so provident of
necessaries, or thought how they were to wash their hands and
face after a victory.  Six hundred horses, under the care of
the Duke of Richmond, were even shipped; and the clothes and
furniture of his court magnificent enough for a bull-fight at
the conquest of Granada.  Felton Hervey's(715) war-horse,
besides having richer caparisons than any of the expedition,
had a gold net to keep off the flies-in winter!  Judge of the
clamours this expense to no purpose will produce! My Lord
Carteret is set out from the Hague, but was not landed when
the last letters came from London: there are no great
expectations from this trip; no more than followed from my
Lord Stair's.

I send you two more odes on Pultney,(716) I believe by the
same hand as the former, though none are equal to the Nova
Progenies, which has been more liked than almost ever any
thing was.  It is not at all known whose they are; I believe
Hanbury Williams's.  The note to the first was printed with
it: the advice to him to be privy seal has its foundation; for
when the consultation was held who were to have places, and my
Lord Gower was named to succeed Lord Hervey, Pultney said with
some warmth, "I designed to be privy seal myself!"

We expect some company next week from Newmarket: here is at
present only Mr. Keene and Pigwiggin,(717)-you never saw so
agreeable a creature!-oh yes! you have seen his parents!  I
must tell you a new story of them Sir Robert had given them a
little horse for Pigwiggin, and somebody had given them
another: both which, to save the charge of keeping, they sent
to grass in Newpark.  After three years that they had not used
them, my Lord Walpole let his own son ride them, while he was
at the park, in the holidays.  Do you know, that the woman
Horace sent to Sir Robert, and made him give her five guineas
for the two horses, because George had ridden them?  I give
you my word this is fact.

There has been a great fracas at Kensington: one of the
Mesdames(718) pulled the chair from under Countess
Deloraine(719) at cards, who, being provoked that her monarch
was diverted with her disgrace, with the malice of a
hobby-horse, gave him just such another fall.  But alas! the
Monarch, like Louis XIV. is mortal in the part that touched
the ground, and was so hurt and so angry, that the countess is
disgraced, and her German rival (720) remains in the sole and
quiet possession of her royal master's favour.

October 9th.

Well! I have waited till this morning, but have no letter from
you; what can be the meaning of it? Sure, if you was ill, Mr.
Chute would write to me!  Your brother protests he never lets
your letters lie at the office.

Sa Majest`e Patapanique(721) has had a dreadful
misfortune!-not lost his first minister, nor his purse--nor
had part of his camp equipage burned in the river, nor waited
for his secretary of state, who is perhaps blown to
Flanders--nay, nor had his chair pulled from under him-worse!
worse! quarrelling with a great pointer last night about their
countesses, he received a terrible shake by the back and a
bruise on the left eye--poor dear Pat! you never saw such
universal consternation! it was at supper.  Sir Robert, who
makes as much rout with him as I do, says, he never saw ten
people show so much real concern! Adieu! Yours, ever and
ever-but write to me.

(714) The Marshal de Maillebois and the Count de Saxe had been
sent with reinforcements from France, to deliver the Marshal
de Broglio and the Marshal de Belleisle, who, with their army,
were shut up in Prague, and surrounded by the superior forces
of the Queen of Hungary, commanded by Prince Charles of
Lorraine.  They succeeded in facilitating the escape of the
Marshal de Broglio, and of a portion of the French troops; but
the Marshal de Belleisle continued to be blockaded in Prague
with twenty-two thousand men, till December 1742, when he made
his escape to Egra.-D.

(715) Felton Hervey, tenth son of John, first Earl of Bristol;
in 1737, appointed groom of the bedchamber to the Duke of
Cumberland.  He died in 1775.-E.

(716) These are "The Capuchin," and the ode beginning, "'Great
Earl of Bath, your reign is o'er;"  As they have been
frequently published, they are omitted.  The "Nova Progenies"
is the well-known ode beginning, "See, a new progeny
descends."-D.

(717) Eldest son of old Horace Walpole. [Afterwards the second
Lord Walpole of Wolterton, and in 1806, at the age of
eighty-three created Earl of Orford.  He died in 1809.-E.]

(718) The Princesses, daughters of George II.-D.

(719) Elizabeth Fenwick, widow of Henry Scott, third Earl of
Deloraine.  She was a favourite of George II. and lived much
in his intimate society.  From the ironical epithets applied
to her in Lord Hervey's ballad in the subsequent letter, it
would appear, that her general conduct was not considered to
be very exemplary.  She died in 1794.-D.

(720) Lady Yarmouth.



289 Letter 86
                                        To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, Oct. 18, 1742.

I have received two letters from you since last post; I
suppose the wind stopped the packet-boat.

Well! was not I in the right to persist in buying the
Dominichin?  don't you laugh at those wise connoisseurs, who
pronounced it a copy? If it is one, where is the original? or
who was that so great master that could equal Dominichin? Your
brother has received the money for it, and Lord Orford is in
great impatience for it; yet he begs, if you can find any
opportunity, that it may be sent in a man-of-war.  I must
desire that the statue may be sent to Leghorn, to be shipped
with it, and that you will get Campagni and Libri to transact
the payment as they did for the picture, and I will pay your
brother.

Villettes' important despatches to you are as ridiculous as
good Mr. Matthews's devotion. - I fancy Mr. Matthews's own god
(722) would make as foolish a figure about a monkey's neck, as
a Roman Catholic one.  You know, Sir Francis Dashwood used to
say that Lord Shrewsbury's providence was an old angry man in
a blue cloak: another person-that I knew, believed providence
was like a mouse, because he is invisible.  I dare to say
Matthews believes, that providence lives upon beef and
pudding, loves prize-fighting and bull-baiting, and drinks fog
to the health of Old England.

I go to London in a week, and then will send you cart-loads of
news: I know none now, but that we hear to-day of the arrival
of Duc d'Aremberg-I suppose to return my Lord Carteret's
visit.  The latter was near being lost; he told the King that
being in a storm, he had thought it safest to put into
Yarmouth roads, at which he laughed, hoh! hoh! hoh!

For want of news, I live upon ballads to you; here is one that
has made a vast noise, and by Lord Hervey's taking great pains
to disperse it, has been thought his own-if it is,(723) he has
taken true care to disguise the niceness of his style.

1. O England, attend. while thy fate I deplore,
Rehearsing the schemes and the conduct of power.
And since only of those who have power I sing,
I am sure none can think that I hint at the King.

2. From the time his son made him old Robin depose,
All the power of a King he was well-known to lose;
But of all but the name and the badges bereft,
Like old women, his paraphernalia are left.

3. To tell how he shook in St. James's for fear,
When first these new Ministers bullied him there,
Makes my blood boil with rage, to think what a thing
They have made of a man We 'obey as a King.

4. Whom they pleas'd they put in, whom they pleas'd they put
out,
And just like a top they all lash'd him about,
Whilst he like a top with a murmuring noise,
Seem'd to grumble, but turn'd to these rude lashing boys.

5. At last Carteret arriving, spoke thus to his grief,
If you'll make me your Doctor, I'll bring you relief;
You see to your closet familiar I come,
And seem like my wife in the circle-at home."

6. Quoth the King, "My good Lord, perhaps you've been told,
That I used to abuse you a little of old;
'But now bring whom you will, and eke turn away,
But let me and my money, and Walmoden(724) stay."

7." For you and Walmoden, I freely consent,
But as for your money, I must have it spent;
I have promised your son (nay, no frowns,) shall have some,
Nor think 'tis for nothing we patriots are come.

8. "But, however, little King, since I find you so good,
Thus stooping below your high courage and blood,
Put yourself in my hands, and I'll do what I can,
To make you look yet like a King and a man.

9. "At your Admiralty and your Treasury-board,
To save one single man y; u shan't say a word,
For, by God! all your rubbish front both you shall shoot,
Walpole's ciphers and Gasherry'S(725) vassals to boot.

10. "And to guard Prince's ears, as all Statesmen take care,
So, long as yours are-not one man shall come near;
For of all your Court-crew we'll leave only those
Who we know never dare to say boh! to a goose.

11. "So your friend booby Grafton I'll e'en let you keep,
Awake he can't hurt, and is still half asleep;
Nor ever was dangerous, but to womankind,
And his body's as impotent now as his mind.

12. "There's another Court-booby, at once hot and dull,
Your pious pimp, Schutz, a mean, Hanover tool;
For your card-play at night he too shall remain,
With virtuous and sober, and wise Deloraine.(726)


13. "And for all your Court-nobles who can't write or read,
As of such titled ciphers all courts stand in need,
Who, like parliament-Swiss, vote and fight for their pay,
They're as good as a new set to cry yea and nay.

14. "Though Newcastle's as false, as he's silly, I know,
By betraying old Robin to me long ago,
As well as all those who employed him before,
Yet I leave him in place, but I leave him no power.

15. "For granting his heart is as black as his hat,
With no more truth in this, than there's sense beneath that;
Yet as he's a coward, he'll shake when I frown;
You call'd him a rascal, I'll use him like one,

16. "And since his estate at elections he'll spend,
And beggar himself, without making a friend;
So whilst the extravagant fool has a sous,
As his brains I can't fear, so his fortune I'll use,

17. "And as miser Hardwicke, with all courts will draw,
He too may remain, but shall stick to his law;
For of foreign affairs, when he talks like a fool,
I'll laugh in his face,, and will cry 'Go to school!'

18. "The Countess of Wilmington, excellent nurse,
I'll trust with the Treasury, not with its purse,
For nothing by her I've resolved shall be done,
She shall sit at that board, as you sit on the throne.

19. "Perhaps now, you expect that I should begin
To tell you the men I design to bring in;
But we're not yet determined on all their demands
-And you'll know soon enough, when they come to kiss hands.

20. "All that weathercock Pultney shall ask, we must grant,
For to make him a great noble nothing, I want;
And to cheat such a man, demands all my arts,
For though he's a fool, he's a fool with great parts,

21. "And as popular Clodius, the Pultney of Rome,
>From a noble, for power did plebeian become,
So this Clodius to be a Patrician shall choose,
Till what one got by changing, the other shall lose.

22. "Thus flatter'd and courted, and gaz'd at by all,
Like Phaeton, rais'd for a day, he shall fall,
Put the world in a flame, and show he did strive
To get reins in his hand, though 'tis plain he can't drive.

23. "For your foreign affairs, howe'er they turn out,
At least I'll take care you shall make a great rout:
Then cock your great hat, strut, bounce, and look bluff,
For though kick'd and cuffd here, you shall there kick and
cuff.

24. "That Walpole did nothing they all used to say,
So I'll do enough, but I'll make the dogs pay;
Great fleets I'll provide, and great armies engage,
Whate'er debts we make, or whate'er wars we wage."

25. With cordials like these the Monarch's new guest
Revived his sunk spirits and gladden'd his heart;
Till in raptures he cried, " y dear Lord, you shall do
Whatever you will, give me troops to review.

26. "But oh! my dear England, since this is thy state,
Who is there that loves thee but weeps at thy fate?
Since in changing thy masters, thou art just like old Rome,
Whilst Faction, Oppression, and Slavery's thy doom.

27. "For though you have made that rogue Walpole retire,
You're out of the frying-pan into the fire!
But since to the Protestant line I'm a friend,
I tremble to think where these changes may end!"

This has not been printed.  You see the burthen of all the
songs Is the rogue Walpole, which he has observed himself, but
I believe is content, as long as they pay off his arrears to
those that began the tune.  Adieu!

293 Letter 87
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, Oct. 23, 1742.

At last I see an end of my pilgrimage; the day after tomorrow
I am affirming it to you as earnestly as if' you had been
doubting of it like myself: but both my brothers are here, and
Sir Robert will let me go.  He must follow himself soon: the
Parliament meets the 16th of November, that the King may go
abroad the first of March: but if all threats prove true
prophecies, he will scarce enter upon heroism so soon, for we
are promised a winter just like the last-new Secret Committees
to be tried for, and impeachments actually put into execution.
It is horrid to have a prospect of a session like the last.

In the meantime, my Lord of Bath and Lord Hervey, who seem
deserted by every body else, are grown the greatest friends in
the world at Bath; and to make a complete triumvirate, my Lord
Gower is always of their party: how they must love one
another, the late, the present, and the would-be Privy Seal!

Lord Hyndford has had great honours in Prussia: that King
bespoke for him a service of plate to the value of three
thousand pounds.  He asked leave for his Majesty's arms to be
put upon it: the King replied, "they should, with the arms of
Silesia added to his paternal coat for ever." I will tell you
Sir ]Robert's remark on this: "He is rewarded thus for having
obtained Silesia for the King of Prussia, which he was sent to
preserve to the Queen of Hungary!"  Her affairs begin to take
a little better turn again; Broglio is prevented from joining
Maillebois, who, they affirm, can never bring his army off, as
the King of Poland is guarding all the avenues of Saxony, to
prevent his passing through that country.

I wrote to you in my last to desire that the Dominichin and my
statue might come by a man-of-war.  Now.  Sir Robert, who is
impatient for his picture, would have it sent in a Dutch ship,
as he says he can easily get it from Holland.  If you think
this conveyance quite safe, I beg my statue may bear it
company.

Tell me if you are tired of ballads on my Lord Bath; if you
are not, here is another admirable one,(727) I believe by the
same hand as the others; but by the conclusion certainly ought
not to be Williams's.  I only send you the good ones, for the
newspapers are every day full of bad ones on this famous earl.

My compliments to the Princess; I dreamed last night that she
was come to Houghton, and not at all `epuis`ee with her
journey.  Adieu!

P.S. I must add a postscript, to mention a thing I have often
designed to ask you to do for me.  Since I came to England I
have been buying drawings, (the time is well chosen, when I
had neglected it in Italy!)  I saw at Florence two books that
I should now be very glad to have, if you could get them
tolerably reasonable; one was at an English painter's; I think
his name was Huckford, over against your house in via Bardi;
they were of Holbein: the other was of Guercino, and brought
to me to see by the Abb`e Bonducci; my dear child, you will
oblige me much if you can get them.

294 Letter 88
             To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 1, 1742.

I have not felt so pleasantly these three months as I do at
present, though I have a great cold with coming into an
unaired house, and have been forced to carry that cold to the
King's levee and the drawing-room.  There were so many new
faces that I scarce knew where I was; I should have taken 'it
for Carlton House, or my Lady Mayoress's visiting-day, only
the people did not seem enough at home, but rather as admitted
to see the King dine in public.  'Tis quite ridiculous to see
the numbers of old ladies, who, from having been wives of
patriots, have not been dressed these twenty years; out they
come, in all the accoutrements that were in use in Queen
Anne's days.  Then the joy and awkward jollity of them is
inexpressible!  They titter, and, wherever you meet them, are
always going to court, and looking at their watches an hour
before the time.  I met several on the birthday, (for I did
not arrive time enough to make clothes,) and they were dressed
in all the colours of the rainbow: they seem to have said to
themselves twenty years ago, ,Well, if ever I do go to court
again, I will have a pink and silver, or a blue and silver,"
and they keep their resolutions.- But here's a letter from
you, sent to me back from Houghton; I must stop to read
it.-Well, I have read it, and am diverted with Madame
Grifoni's being with child; I hope she was too.  I don't
wonder that she hates the country; I dare to say her child
does not owe its existence to the Villeggiatura.  When you
wrote, it seems you had not heard what a speedy determination
was put to Don Philip's reign in Savoy.  I suppose he will
retain the title: you know great princes are fond of titles,
which proves they are not so great as they once were.

I find a very different face of things from what we had
conceived in the country.  There are, indeed, thoughts of
renewing attacks on Lord Orford, and Of stepping the supplies;
but the new ministry laugh at these threats, having secured a
vast majority in the House: the Opposition themselves own that
the Court will have upwards of a hundred majority: I don't,
indeed, conceive how; but they are confident of carrying every
thing.  They talk of Lord Gower's not keeping the privy seal;
that he will either resign it, or have it taken away: Lord
Bath, who is entering into all the court measures, is most
likely to succeed him.  The late Lord Privy Seal(728) has had
a most ridiculous accident at Bath: he used to play in a
little inner room; but one night some ladies had got it, and
he was reduced to the public room; but being extremely absent
and deep in politics, he walked through the little room to a
convenience behind the curtain, from whence (still absent) he
produced himself in a situation extremely diverting to the
women: imagine his delicacy, and the passion he was in at
their laughing!

I laughed at myself prodigiously the other day for a piece of
absence; I was writing on the King's birthday, and being
disturbed with the mob in the street, I rang for the porter,
and, with an air of grandeur, as if I was still at Downing
Street, cried, "Pray send away those marrowbones and
cleavers!" The poor fellow with the most mortified air in the
world, replied, "Sir, they are not at our door, but over the
way at my Lord Carteret's." "Oh," said I, "then let them
alone; may be he does not dislike the noise!" I pity the poor
porter, who sees all his old customers going over the way too.

Our operas begin to-morrow with a pasticcio, full of most of
my favourite songs: the Fumagalli has disappointed us; she had
received an hundred ducats, and then wrote word that she had
spent them, and was afraid of coming through the Spanish
quarters; but if they would send her an hundred more, she
would come next year.  Villettes has what been written to in
the strongest manner to have her forced hither (for she is at
Turin.) I tell you this by way of key, in case you should
receive a mysterious letter in cipher from him about this
important business.

I have not seen Due d'Aremberg; but I hear that all the
entertainments for him are suppers, for he -will dine at his
own hour, eleven in the morning.  He proposed it to the
Duchess of Richmond when she invited him; but she said she did
not know where to find company to dine with him at that hour.

I must advise YOU to be cautious how you refuse humouring our
captains (729) in any of their foolish schemes; for they are
popular, and I should be very sorry to have them out of humour
with you when they come home, lest it should give any handle
to your enemies.  Think of it, my dear child! The officers in
Flanders, that are members of parliament, have had
intimations, that if they asked leave to come on their private
affairs, and drop in, not all together, they will be very well
received; this is decorum.  Little Brook's little wife is a
little with child.  Adieu!

(728) Lord Hervey.

(729) The captains of ships in the English fleet at Leghorn.



296 Letter 89
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, Nov. 15, 1742.

I have not written to you lately, expecting letters from you;
last I have received two.  I still send mine through France,
as I am afraid they would get to you with still more
difficulty through Holland.

Our army is just now ordered to march to Mayence, at the
repeated instances of the Queen of Hungary; Lord Stair goes
with them, but almost all the officers that arc in parliament
arc come over, for the troops are only to be in garrison till
March, when, it is said, the King will take the field with
them.  This step makes a great noise, for the old remains of
the Opposition are determined to persist, and have termed this
a H(inoverian measure.  They begin to-morrow, with opposing
the address on the King's speech: Pitt is to be the leading
mail; there are none but he and Lyttelton of the Prince's
court, who do not join with the ministry: the Prince has told
them, that he will follow the advice they long ago gave him,
"turning out all his people who do not vote as he would have
them."

Lord Orford is come to town, and was at the King's levee
to-day; the joy the latter showed to see him was very visible:
all the new ministry came and spoke to him; and he had a long,
laughing conversation with my Lord Chesterfield, who is still
in Opposition.

You have heard, I suppose, of the revolution in the French
Court; Madame de Mailly is disgraced, and her handsome sister
De la Tournelle(730) succeeds: the latter insisted on three
conditions; first, that the Mailly should quit the palace
before she entered it; next, that she should be declared
mistress, to which post, they pretend, there is a large salary
annexed, (but that is not probable,) and lastly, that she may
always have her own parties at supper: the last article would
very well explain what she proposes to do with her salary.

There are admirable instructions come up from Worcester to
Sandys and Winnington; they tell the latter how little hopes
they always had of him.  "But for you, Mr. Sandys, who have
always, etc., you to snatch at the first place you could get,"
etc.  In short, they charge him, who is in the Treasury and
Exchequer not to vote for any supplies.(731)

I write to you in a vast hurry, for I am going to the meeting
at the Cockpit, to hear the King's speech read to the members:
Mr. Pelham presides there.  They talk of a majority of
fourscore: we shall see to-morrow.

The Pomfrets stay in the country most part of the winter-.
Lord Lincoln and Mr. (George) Pitt have declared off in
form.(732)  So much for the schemes of my lady!  The Duke of
Grafton used to say that they put him in mind of a troop of
Italian comedians; Lord Lincoln was Valere, Lady Sophia,
Columbine, and my lady the old mother behind the scenes.

Our operas go on au plus miserable: all our hopes lie in a new
dancer, Sodi, who has performed but once, but seems to please
as much as the Fausan.  Did I tell you how well they had
chosen the plot of the first opera? There was a prince who
rebels against his father, who had before rebelled against
his.(733)  The Duke of Montagu says, there is to be an opera
of dancing, with singing between the acts.

My Lord Tyrawley(734) is come from Portugal, and has brought
three wives and fourteen children; one of the former is a
Portuguese, with long black hair plaited down to the bottom of
her back.  He was asked the other night at supper, what he
thought of England; whether he found much alteration from
fifteen years ago?  "No," he said, "not at all: why, there is
my Lord Bath, I don't see the least alteration in him; he is
just what he was: and then I found Lord Grantham (735) walking
on tiptoe, as if he was still afraid of waking the Queen."

Hanbury Williams is very ill at Bath, and his wife in the same
way in private lodgings in the city.  Mr. Doddington has at
last owned his match with his old mistress.(736)  I suppose he
wants a new one.

I commend your prudence about Leghorn; but, my dear child,
what pain I am in about you! Is it possible to be easy while
the Spaniards are at your gates! write me word every minute as
your apprehensions vanish or increase.  I ask every moment
what people think; but how can they tell here? You say nothing
of Mr. Chute, sure he is with You Still! When I am in such
uneasiness about you, I want you every post to mention your
friends being with you: I am sure you have none so good or
sensible as he is.  I am vastly obliged to you for the thought
of the book of shells, and shall like -it much; and thank you
too about my Scagliola table; but I am distressed about your
expenses.  Is there any way one could get your allowance
increased? You know how low my interest is now; but you know
too what a push I would make to be of any service to you-tell
me,, and adieu!

(730) Afterwards created Duchess of Chateauroux. (Mary Anne
(le Mailly, widow of the Marquis de la Tournelle.  She
succeeded her sister Madame de Mailly, as mistress of Louis
XV., as the latter had succeeded the other sister, Madame de
Vintimille, in the same situation.  Madame de Chateauroux was
sent away from the court during the illness of Louis at Metz;
but on his recovery he recalled her.  Shortly after which she
died, December 10, 1744, and on her deathbed accused M. de
Maurepas, the minister, of having poisoned her.  The intrigue,
by means of which she supplanted her sister, was conducted
principally by the Marshal de Richelieu.-D.

will postpone the supplies until you have renewed the secret

298 Letter 90
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec. 2, 1742.,

You will wonder that it is above a fortnight Since I wrote to
you; but I have had an inflammation in one of my eyes, and
durst not meddle with a pen.  I have had two letters from you
of Nov. 6th and 13th, but I am in the utmost impatience for
another, to hear you are quite recovered of your Trinculos and
FuribOndos.  You tell me you was in a fever; I cannot be easy
till I hear from you again.  I hope this will come much too
late for a medicine, but it will always serve for sal volatile
to give you spirits.  Yesterday was appointed for considering
the army; but Mr. Lyttelton stood up and moved for another
Secret Committee, in the very words of last year; but the
whole debate ran, not upon Robert Earl of Orford, but Robert
Earl of Sandys:(737) he is the constant butt of the party;
indeed he bears it notably.  After five hours' haranguing, we
came to a division, and threw out the motion by a majority of
sixty-seven, 253 against 186.  The Prince had declared so
openly for union and agreement in all measures, that, except
the Nepotism,(738) all his servants but one were with us.  I
don't know whether they will attempt any thing else, but with
these majorities we must have an easy winter.  The union of
the Whigs has saved this parliament.  It is expected that Pitt
and Lyttelton will be dismissed by the Prince.  That faction
and Waller are the only Whigs of any note that do not join
with the Court.  I do not  count Doddington, who must now
always be with the minority, for no majority will accept him.
It is believed that Lord Gower will retire, or be desired to
do so.  I suppose you have heard from Rome,(739) that Murray
is made Solicitor-general, in the room of Sir John Strange,
who has resigned for his health.  This is the sum of politics;
we can't expect any winter, (I hope no winter will be) like
the last.  By the crowds that come hither, one should not know
that Sir Robert is out of place, only that now he is scarce
abused.

De reste, the town is wondrous dull; operas unfrequented,
plays not in fashion, amours as old as marriages-in short,
nothing but whist!  I have not yet learned to play, but I find
that I wait in vain for its being left off.

I agree with you about not sending home the Dominichin in an
English vessel; but what I mentioned to you of its coming in a
Dutch vessel, if you find an opportunity, I think will be very
safe, if you approve it; but manage that as you like.  I shall
hope for my statue at the same time; but till the conveyance
is absolutely safe, I know you will not venture them.  Now I
mention my statue, I must beg you will send me a full bill of
all my debts to you, which I am sure by this time must be
infinite; I beg to know the particulars, that I may pay your
brother.  Adieu, my dear Sir; take care of yourself, and
submit to popery and slavery rather than get colds with
sea-heroes.(740)

(737) Samuel Sandys, chancellor of the Exchequer, in the room
of Sir R. Walpole.

(738) Lord Cobham's nephews and cousins.-D.

(739) This alludes to the supposed Jacobite principles of
Murray, afterwards Lord Mansfield.-D.

(740) Sir H. Mann had complained, in one of his letters, of
the labours he had gone through in doing the honours of
Florence to some of Admiral Matthews's (il Furibondo)
officers.  The English fleet was now at Leghorn, upon the plea
of defending the Tuscan territories, in case of their being
attacked by the Spaniards.-D.




299 Letter 91
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec. 9, 1742.

I shall have quite a partiality for the post of Holland; it
brought me two letters last week, and two more yesterday, of
November 20th and 27th; but I find you have your perpetual
headaches-how can you say that you shall tire me with talking
Of them? you may make me suffer by your pains, but I will hear
and insist upon your always telling me of your health.  Do you
think I only correspond with you to know the posture of the
Spaniards or the `epuisements of the Princess! I am anxious,
too, to know how poor Mr. Whithed does, and Mr. Chute's gout.
I shall look upon our sea captains with as much horror as the
King of Naples can, if they bring gouts, fits, and headaches.
You will have had a letter from me by this time, to give up
sending the Dominichin by a man-of-war, and to propose its
coming in a Dutch ship.  I believe that will be safe.


We have had another great day in the House on the army in
Flanders, which the Opposition were for disbanding; but we
carried 'it by a hundred and twenty.(741)  Murray spoke for
the first time, with the greatest applause; Pitt answered him
with all his force and art of language, but on an ill-founded
argument.  In all appearances, they will be great rivals.
Shippen was in great rage at Murray's apostacy;(742) if any
thing can really change his principles, possibly this
competition may.  To-morrow we shall have a tougher battle on
the sixteen thousand Hanoverians.  Hanover is the word given
out for this winter: there is a most bold pamphlet come out,
said to be Lord
Marchmont's,(743) which affirms that in every treaty made
since the accession of this family, England has been
sacrificed to the interest of Hanover, and consequently
insinuates the incompatibility of the two. Lord Chesterfield
says, "that if we have a mind effectually to prevent the
Pretender from ever obtaining this crown, we should make him
Elector of Hanover, for the people of England will never fetch
another king from thence."  Adieu! my dear child.  I am sensible
that I write you short letters, but I write you all I know.  I
don't know how it is, but the wonderful seems worn out.  In this
our day, we have no rabbit women-no elopements-no epic
poems,(744) finer than Milton's-no contest about harlequins and
Polly Peachems.  Jansen (745) has won no more estates, and the
Duchess of Queensberry is grown as tame as her neighbours.  Whist
has spread an universal opium over the whole nation; it makes
courtiers and patriots sit down to the same pack of cards.
The only thing extraordinary, and which yet did not seem to
surprise any body, was the Barberina's(746) being attacked by
four men masqued, the other night, as she came out of the
opera house, who would have forced her away, but she
screamed, and the guard came.  Nobody knows who set them on,
and I believe nobody inquired.

The Austrians in Flanders have separated from our troops a
little out of humour, because it was impracticable for them to
march without any preparatory provisions for their reception.
They will probably march in two months, if no peace prevents
it.  Adieu!

(741) Upon a motion, made by Sir William Yonge, that 534,763
pounds be granted for defraying the charge of 16,259 men, to
be employed in Flanders.  The numbers on the division were 280
against 160.-E.

301 Letter 92
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec. 23, 1742.

I have had no letter from you this fortnight, and I have heard
nothing this month: judge now how fit I am to write.  I hope
it is not another mark of growing old; but, I do assure you,
my writing begins to leave me.  Don't be frightened! I don't
mean this as an introduction towards having done with you-I
will write to you to the very stump of my pen, and as Pope
says,

"Squeeze out the last dull droppings of my sense."

But I declare, it is hard to sit spinning out one's brains by
the fireside, without having heard the least thing to set
one's hand a-going.  I am so put to it for something to say,
that I would make a memorandum of the most improbable lie that
could be invented by a viscountess-dowager; as the old Duchess
of Rutland (747) does when she is told of some strange
casualty, "Lucy, child, step into the next room and set that
down."-"Lord, Madam!" says Lady Lucy,(748) "it can't be
true!"-"Oh, no matter, child; it will do for news into the
country next post." But do you conceive that the kingdom of
the Dull is come upon earth-not with the forerunners and
prognostics of other to-come kingdoms? No, no; the sun and the
moon go on just as they used to do, without giving us any
hints: we see no knights come prancing upon pale horses, or
red horses; no stars, called wormwood, fall into the Thames,
and turn a third part into wormwood; no locusts, like horses,
with their hair as the hair of women-in short, no
thousand things, each of which destroys a third part of
mankind: the only token of this new kingdom is a woman riding
on a beast, which is the mother of abominations, and the name
in the forehead is whist: and the four-and-twenty elders, and
the woman, and the whole town, do nothing but play with this
beast.  Scandal itself is dead, or confined to a pack of
cards; for the only malicious whisper I have heard this
fortnight, is of an intrigue between the Queen of hearts and
the Knave of clubs.  Y
our friend Lady Sandwich (749) has got a son; if one may
believe the belly she wore, it is a brave one.  Lord
Holderness(750) has lately given a magnificent repast to
fifteen persons; there were three courses of ten, fifteen, and
fifteen, and a sumptuous dessert: a great saloon illuminated,
odours, and violins-and, who do you think were the
invited?-the Visconti, Giuletta, the Galli, Amorevoli,
Monticelli, Vanneschi and his wife, Weedemans the hautboy, the
prompter, etc. The bouquet was given to the Guiletta, who is
barely handsome.  How can one love magnificence and low
company at the same instant!  We are making great parties for
the Barberina and the Auretti, a charming French girl; and our
schemes succeed so well, that the opera begins to fill
surprisingly; for all those who don't love music, love noise
and party, and will any night give half-a-guinea for the
liberty of hissing-such is English harmony.

I have been in a round of dinners with Lord Stafford, and
Bussy the French minister, who tells one stories of Capuchins,
confessions, Henri Quatre, Louis XIV., Gascons, and the string
which all Frenchmen go through, without any connexion or
relation to the discourse.  These very stories, which I have
already heard four times, are only interrupted by English
puns, which old Churchill translates out of jest-books into
the mouth of my Lord Chesterfield, and into most execrable
French.

Adieu! I have scribbled, and blotted, and made nothing out,
and, in short, have nothing to say, so good night!

302 Letter 93
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 6, 1743.

You will wonder that you have not heard from me, but I have
been too ill to write.  I have been confined these ten days
with a most violent cough, and they suspected an inflammation
on my lungs; but I am come off with the loss of my eyes and my
voice, both of which I am recovering, and would write to you
to-day.  I have received your long letter of December 11th,
and return you a thousand thanks for giving up so much of your
time; I wish I could make as long a letter for you, but we arc
in a neutrality of news.  The Elector Palatine (751) is dead;
but I have not heard what alterations that will make.  Lord
Wilmington's death, which is reckoned hard upon, is likely to
make more conversation here.  He is going to Bath, but that is
only to pass away the time until be dies.

The great Vernon is landed, but we have not been alarmed with
any bonfires or illuminations; he has outlived all his
popularity.  There is nothing new but the separation of a Mr.
and Mrs. French, whom it is impossible you should know.  She
has been fashionable these two winters; her husband has
commenced a suit in Doctors' Commons against her cat, and
will, they say, recover considerable damages: but the lawyers
are of opinion, that the kittens must inherit Mr. French's
estate, as they were born in lawful wedlock.

The parliament meets again on Monday, but I don't hear of any
fatigue that we are likely to have; in a little time, I
suppose, we shall hear what campaigning we are to make.

I must tell you of an admirable reply of your acquaintance the
Duchess of Queensberry:(752) old Lady Granville, Lord
Carteret's mother, whom they call the Queen-Mother, from
taking upon her to do the honours of her son's power, was
pressing the duchess to ask her for some place for herself or
friends, and assured her that she would procure it, be it what
it would.  Could she have picked out a fitter person to be
gracious to?  The duchess made her a most grave curtsey, and
said, "Indeed, there was one thing she had set her heart
on."-"Dear child, how you oblige me by asking, any thing! What
is it?  tell me."  "Only that you would speak to my Lord
Carteret to get me made lady of the bedchamber to the Queen of
Hungary."

I come now to your letter, and am not at all pleased to find
that the Princess absolutely intends to murder you with her
cold rooms.  I wish you could come on those cold nights and
sit by my fireside; I have the prettiest warm little
apartment, with all my baubles, and Patapans, and cats!
Patapan and I go to-morrow to New Park, to my lord, for the
air, and come back with him on Monday.

What an infamous story that affair of Nomis is! and how
different the ideas of honour among officers in your world and
ours!  Your history of cicisbeosm is more entertaining: I
figure the distress of a parcel of lovers who have so many
things to dread-the government in this world! purgatory in the
next! inquisitions, villeggiaturas, convents, etc.

Lord Essex is extremely bad, and has not strength enough to go
through the remedies that are necessary to his recovery.  He
now fancies that he does not exist, will not be persuaded to
walk or talk, because, as he sometimes says, "How should he do
any thing? he is not."  You say, "How came I not to see Duc
d'Aremberg?" I did once at the opera; but he went away soon
after: and here it is not the way to visit foreigners, unless
you are of the Court, or are particularly in a way of having
them at your house: consequently Sir R. never saw him
either-we are not of the Court! Next, as to Arlington Street:
Sir R. is in a middling kind of house, which has long been
his, and was let; he has taken a small one next to it for me,
and they are laid together.

I come now to speak to you of the affair of the Duke of
Newcastle; but absolutely, on considering it much myself, and
on talking of it with your brother, we both are against your
attempting any such thing.  In the first place, I never heard
a suspicion of the duke's taking presents, and should think he
would rather be affronted: in the next place, my dear child,
though you are fond of that coffee-pot, it would be thought
nothing among such wardrobes as he has, of the finest wrought
plate: why, he has- a set of gold plates that would make a
figure on any sideboard in the Arabian Tales;(753) and as to
Benvenuto cellini, if the duke could take it for his, people
in England understand all work too well to be deceived.
Lastly, as there has been no talk of alterations in the
foreign ministers, and as all changes seem at an end, why
should you be apprehensive?  As to Stone,(754) if any thing
was done, to be sure it should be to him though I really can't
advise even that.  These are my sentiments sincerely: by no
means think of the duke.  Adieu!

(751) Charles Philip of Neubourg, , Elector Palatine.  He died
December 31, 1742.  He was succeeded by Charles Theodore,
Prince of Sulzbach, descended from a younger branch of the
house of Neubourg, and who, in his old age, became Elector of
Bavaria.-D.

(752) Catherine Hyde, daughter of the Earl of Clarendon, and
wife of Charles Douglas, Duke of Queensberry; a famous beauty,
celebrated by Prior in that pretty poem which begins, "Kitty,
beautiful and young," and often mentioned in Swift and Pope's
letters, She was forbid the Court for promoting subscriptions
to the second part of the Beggar's Opera, when it had been
prohibited from being acted.  She and the duke erected the
monument to Gay in Westminster Abbey. [And to which Pope
supplied the epitaph, "the first eight lines of which," says
Dr. Johnson, "have no grammar; the adjectives without
substantives, and the epithets without a subject." The duchess
died in 1777, and her husband in the year following.]

(753) Walpole, in his Memoires, says that the duke's houses,
gardens, table, and equipages swallowed immense treasures, and
that the sums he owed were only exceeded by those he wasted.
He employed several physicians, without having had apparently
much need of them.  His gold plate appears to have been almost
as dear to him as his health; for he usually kept it in pawn,
except when he wished to display it on great occasions.

(754) Andrew Stone, at this time private secretary to the Duke
of Newcastle.  he subsequently filled the offices of under-
secretary of state, sub-governor to Prince George, keeper of
the state-paper office, and, on the marriage of George the
third, treasurer to the Queen.  he died in 1773.-E.



304 Letter 94
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 13, 1743,

Your brother brought me two letters together this morning, and
at the same time showed me yours to your father. How should I
be ashamed, were I he, to receive such a letter! so dutiful,
so humble, and yet so expressive of the straits to which he
has let you be reduced! My dear child, it looks too much like
the son of a minister, when I am no longer so; but I can't
help repeating to you offers of any kind of service that you
think I can do for you any way.

I am quite happy at your thinking Tuscany so secure from
Spain, unless the wise head of Richcourt works against the
season; but how can I ever be easy while a provincial
Frenchman, Something half French, half German, instigated by a
mad Englishwoman is to govern an Italian dominion?

I laughed much at the magnificent presents made by one of the
first families in Florence to their young accouch`ee.  Do but
think if a Duke or Duchess of Somerset were to give a Lady
Hertford fifty pounds and twenty yards of velvet for bringing
an heir to the blood of Seymour!

It grieves me that my letters drop in so slowly to you: I have
never missed writing, but when I have been absolutely too much
out of order, or once or twice when I had no earthly thing to
tell you.  This winter is so quiet, that one must inquire much
to know any thing.  The parliament is met again, but we do not
hear of any intended opposition to any thing.  the tories have
dropped the affair of the Hanoverians in the House of Lords,
in compliment to Lord Gower.  there is a second pamphlet on
that subject which makes a great noise.(755)  The ministry are
much distressed on the ways and means for raising the money
for this year: there is to be a lottery, but that will not
supply a quarter of what they want.  They have talked of a new
duty on tea, to be paid by every housekeeper for all the
persons in their families; but it will scarce be proposed.
Tea is so universal, that it would make a greater clamour than
a duty on wine.  Nothing is determined; the new folks do not
shine at expedients.  Sir Robert's health is now drunk at all
the clubs in the city; there they are for having him made a
duke, and placed again at the head of the Treasury; but I
believe nothing could prevail on him to return thither.  He
says he will keep the 12th of February,.-the day he resigned,
with his family as long as he lives.  They talk of Sandys
being raised to the peerage, by way of getting rid of him; he
is so dull they can scarce draw him on.(756)

The English troops in Flanders march to-day, whither we don't
know, but "probably to Liege: from whence they imagine the
Hanoverians are going into Juliers and Bergue.(757)  The
ministry have been greatly alarmed with the King of Sardinia's
retreat, and suspected that it was a total one from the
Queen's interest; but it seems he sent for Villettes and the
Hungarian minister, and had their previous approbations of his
deserting Chamberry, etc.

Vernon is not yet got to town, we are impatient for what will
follow the arrival of this mad hero.  Wentworth will certainly
challenge him, but Vernon does not profess personal valour: he
was once knocked down by a merchant, who then offered him
satisfaction-but he was satisfied.

Lord Essex' is dead:(758) Lord Lincoln will have the
bedchamber; Lord Berkeley of Stratton(759) (a disciple of
Carteret's) the Pensioners; and Lord Carteret himself probably
the riband.

As to my Lady Walpole's dormant title,(760) it was in her
family; but being in the King's power to give to which sister
in equal claim he pleased, it was bestowed on Lord Clinton,
who descended from the younger sister of Lady W.'s
grandmother, or great grand-something.  My Lady Clifford,(761)
Coke's mother, got her barony so, in preference to Lady
Salisbury and Lady Sondes, her elder sisters, who had already
titles for their children.  It is called a title in abeyance.

Sir Robert has just bid me tell you to send the Dominichin by
the first safe conveyance to Matthews, who has had orders from
Lord Winchilsea (762) to send it by the first man-of-war to
England; or if you meet with a ship going to Port Mahon, then
you must send it thither to Anstruther, and write to him that
Lord Orford desires that he will take care of it, and send it
by the first ship that comes directly home.  He is so
impatient for it, that he will have it thus; but I own I
should not like to have my things tumbled out of one ship into
another, and beg mine may stay till they can come at once.
Adieu!

Great Britain examined."  It was written by Lord Chesterfield,
and excited much attention.-E.

(756) In December he was created a peer, by the title of Lord
Sandys, Baron of Ombersley, and made cofferer of the
household.-E.

(757) The British troops began their march from Flanders at
the end of February, under the command of the Earl of Stair;
but were so tardy in their movements, that it was the middle
of May before they crossed the Rhine and fixed their station
at Hochst, between Mayence and Frankfort.-E.

bedchamber, knight of the garter, and captain of the yeomen of

in 1773.-D.

(760) The barony of Clinton in fee descended to the daughters
of Theophilus, Earl of Huntingdon, who died without male
issue.  One of those ladies died without children, by which
means the title lay between the families of Rolle and
Fortescue.  King George I. gave it to Hugh Fortescue,
afterwards Created an earl; on whose death it descended to his
only sister, a maiden lady, after whom, without issue, it
devolved on Lady Orford.

(761) Lady Margaret Tufton, third daughter of Thomas, sixth
Earl of Thanet.  the barony of De Clifford had descended to
Lord Thanet, from his mother, Lady Margaret Sackville,
daughter of Anne Clifford, Countess of Dorset, Pembroke, and
Montgomery.  Upon Lord Thanet's death, the barony of De
Clifford fell into abeyance between his five daughters.  These
were Lady Catherine, married to Edward Watson, Viscount
Sondus; Lady Anne, married to James Cecil, Earl of Salisbury;
Lady Margaret, before mentioned; Lady Mary, married first to
Anthony Grey, Earl of Harold, and secondly to John Earl Gower;
and Lady Isabella, married to Lord Nassau Powlett.-D.

(762) First lord of the admiralty.-]).



306 Letter 95
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 27, 1743.

I could not write you last Thursday, I was so much out of
order with a cold; your brother came and found me in bed.
TO-night, that I can write, I have nothing to tell you; except
that yesterday the welcome news (to the ministry) came of the
accession of the Dutch to the King's measures.  They are in
great triumph; but till it Is clear what part his Prussian
Uprightness is acting, other people take the liberty to be
still in suspense.  So they are about all our domestic matters
too.  It is a general stare! the alteration that must soon
happen in the Treasury will put some end to the uncertainties
of this winter.  Mr. Pelham is universally named to the head
of it; but Messrs.  Prince,(263) Carteret, Pultney, and
Companies must be a little considered.  how they will like it:
the latter the least.

You will wonder, perhaps be peevish, when I protest I have not
another paragraph by me in the world.  I want even common
conversation; for I cannot persist, like the royal family, in
asking people the same questions, "Do you love walking?" "Do
you love music'!" "Was you at the opera?" "When do you go into
the country!"  I have nothing else to say: nothing happens;
scarce the common episodes of a newspaper, of a man falling
off a ladder and breaking his leg; or of a countryman cheated
out of his leather pouch, with fifty shillings in it.  We are
in such a state of sameness, that I shall begin to wonder at
the change of seasons, and talk of the spring as a strange
accident.  Lord Tyrawley, who has been fifteen years in
Portugal, is of my opinion; he says he finds nothing but a
fog, whist, and the House of Commons.

In this lamentable state, when I know not what to write even
to you, what can I do about my serene Princess Grifoni? Alas!
I owe her two letters, and where to find a beau sentiment, I
cannot tell! I believe I may have some by me in an old chest
of draws, with some exploded red-heel shoes and full-bottom
wigs; but they would come out so yellow and moth-eaten! Do bow
to her, in every superlative degree in the language, that my
eyes have been so bad, that as I wrote you word, over and
over, I have not been able to write a line.  That will move
her, when she hears what melancholy descriptions I write, of
my not being able to write-nay, indeed it will not be so
ridiculous as you think; for it is ten times worse for the
eyes to write in a language one don't much practise! I
remember a tutor at Cambridge, who had been examining some
lads in Latin, but in a little while excused himself, and said
he must speak English, for his mouth was very sore.

I had a letter from you yesterday of January 7th, N. S. which
has wonderfully excited my compassion for the necessities of
the princely family,(764) and the shifts the old Lady' is put
to for quadrille.(765)

I triumph much on my penetration about the honest
Rucellai(766)-we little people, who have no honesty, virtue,
nor shame, do so exult when a good neighbour, who was a
pattern, turns out as bad as oneself!  We are like the good
woman in the Gospel, who chuckled so much on finding her lost
bit; we have more joy on a saint's fall, than in ninety-nine
devils, who were always de nous autres! I am a little pleased
too, that Marquis BagneSi'(767) whom you know I always liked
much, has behaved so well; and am more pleased to hear what a
Beffana(768) the Electress(769) is-Pho! here am I sending you
back your own paragraphs, cut and turned! it is so silly to
think that you won't know them again! I will not spin myself
any longer; it is better to make a short letter.  I am going
to the masquerade, and will fancy myself in via della
Pergola.(770)  Adieu! "Do you know me?"-"That man there with
you, in the black domino, is Mr. Chute.,, Good night!

(763) Frederick, Prince of Wales.-D.

(764) Prince and Princess Craon.

(765) Madame Sarasin.

(766) Sir H. Mann says, in his letter of January 7, 1743, 11 I
must be so just as to tell you, @my friend, the Senator
Rucellai, is, as you always thought, a sad fellow.  He has
quite abandoned me for fear of offending."-D.

(767) "Apropos of duels, two of our young nobles, Marquis
BagneSi and Strozzi, have fought about a debt of' fifteen
shillings; the latter, the creditor and the occasion of the
fight, behaved ill."-Letter from Sir H. Mann, dated Jan. 7,
1743.-D.

(768) A Beffana was a puppet, which was carried about the town
on the evening of the Epiphany.  The word is derived from
Epifania.  It also means an ugly woman.  The Electress
happened to go out for the first time after an illness on the
Epiphany, and said in joke to Prince Craon, that the "Beffane
all went abroad on that day."-D.

(769) The Electress Palatine Dowager, the last of the House of
Medici.

(770) A street at Florence, in which the Opera house stands.



308 Letter 96
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 2, 1743.

Last night at the Duchess of Richmond's I saw Madame
Goldsworthy: what a pert, little, unbred thing it is! The
duchess presented us to one another; but I cannot say that
either of us stepped a foot beyond the first civilities.  The
good duchess was for harbouring her and all her brood: how it
happened to her I don't conceive, but the thing had decency
enough to refuse it.  She is going to live with her father at
Plymouth-tant mieux!

The day before yesterday the lords had a great day: Earl
Stanhope(771) moved for an address to his Britannic Majesty,
in consideration of the heavy wars, taxes, etc. far exceeding
all that ever were known, to exonerate his people of foreign
troops, Hanoverians,) which are so expensive, and can In no
light answer the ends for which they were hired.  Lord
Sandwich seconded: extremely well, I hear, for I was not
there.  Lord Carteret answered, but was under great concern.
Lord Bath spoke too, and would fain have persuaded that this
measure was not Solely Of one minister, but that himself and
all the council were equally concerned in it.  The late Privy
Seal(772) Spoke for an hour and a half, with the greatest
applause, against the Hanoverians: and my Lord Chancellor
extremely well for them.  The division was, 90 for the Court,
35 against it  The present Privy Seal(773) voted with the
Opposition: so there will soon be another.  Lord Halifax, the
Prince's new Lord, was with the minority too; the other, Lord
Darnley,(774) with the Court.  After the division, Lord
Scarborough, his Royal Highness's Treasurer, moved an address
of approbation of the measure, which was carried by 78 to the
former 35.  Lord Orford was ill, and could not be there, but
sent his proxy: he has got a great cold and slow fever, but
does not keep his room.  If Lord Gower loses the Privy Seal,
(as it is taken for granted he does not design to keep it,)
and Lord Bath refuses it, Lord Cholmondeley stands the fairest
for it.

I will conclude abruptly, for you will be tired of my telling
you that I have nothing to tell you-but so it is literally-
oh! yes, you will want to know what the Duke of Argyle did-he
was not there; he is every thing but superannuated.  Adieu!

(771) Philip, second Earl Stanhope, born in 1714.  He
succeeded his father when he was only seven years old, and
died in 1786.  His character is thus sketched by his great-
grandson, Viscount Mahon, in his History of England, vol. iii.
p. 242.-"He had great talents, but fitter for speculation than
for practical objects of action.  He made himself one of the
best-Lalande used to say the best-mathematicians in England of
his day, and was likewise deeply skilled in other branches of
science and philosophy.  The Greek language was as familiar to
him as the English; he was said to know every line of Homer by
heart.  In public life, on the contrary, he was shy, ungainly,
and embarrassed.  From his first onset in Parliament, he took
part with vehemence against the administration of Sir Robert
Walpole."  Bishop Secker says, that Lord Stanhope "spoke a
precomposed speech, which he held in his hand, with great
tremblings and agitations, and hesitated frequently in the
midst of great vehemence."-E.

(772) Lord Hervey.


(773) Lord Gower.

Lord of the Bedchamber to Frederic Prince of Wales.-D.

To Sir Horace Mann.
Feb. 13, 1743.

Ceretesi tells me that Madame Galli is dead: I have had two
letters from you this week; but the last mentions only the
death of old Strozzi.  I am quite sorry for Madame Galli,
because I proposed seeing her again, on my return to Florence,
which I have firmly in my intention: I hope it will be a
little before Ceretesi's, for he seems to be planted here.  I
don't conceive who -waters him! Here are two noble Venetians
that have carried him about lately to Oxford and Blenheim: I
am literally waiting for him now, to introduce him to Lady
Brown's sunday night; it is the great mart for all travelling
and travelled calves-pho! here he is.

Monday morning.-Here is your brother: he tells me you never
hear from me; how can that be? I receive yours, and you
generally mention having got one of mine, though long after
the time you should.  I never miss above one post, and that
but very seldom.  I am longer receiving yours, though you have
never missed; but then-I frequently receive two at once.  I am
delighted with Goldsworthy's mystery about King Theodore! If
you will promise me not to tell him, I will tell you@a secret,
which is, that if that person is not King Theodore, I assure
you it is not Sir Robert Walpole.

I have nothing to tell you but that Lord Effingham Howard(775)
is dead, and Lord Litchfield(776) at the point of death; he
was struck with a palsy last Thursday.  Adieu!

(775) Francis, first Earl of Effingham, and seventh Lord
Howard of Effingham.  He died February 12, 1743.-D.

February 15, 1743.-D.



309 Letter 98
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 24, 1743.

I write to you in the greatest hurry in the world, but write I
will.  Besides, I must wish you joy; you are warriors; nay,
conquerors;(777) two things quite novel in this war, for
hitherto it has been armies without fighting, and deaths
without killing.  We talk of this battle as of a comet; "Have
you heard of the battle?" it Is so strange a thing, that
numbers imagine you may go (ind see it at Charing Cross.
Indeed, our officers, who are going to Flanders, don't quite
like it; they are afraid it should grow the fashion to fight,
and that a pair of colours should be no longer a sinecure.  I
am quite unhappy about poor Mr. Chute: besides, it is cruel to
find that abstinence is not a drug.  If mortification ever
ceases to be a medicine, or virtue to be a passport to
carnivals in the other world, who will be a self-tormentor any
longer-not, my child, that I am one; but, tell me, is he quite
recovered?

I thank you for King Theodore's declaration,(778) and wish Him
success with all my soul.  I hate the Genoese; they make a
commonwealth the most devilish of all tyrannies!

We have every now and then motions for disbanding Hessians and
Hanoverians, alias mercenaries; but they come to nothing.
To-day the party have declared that they have done for this
session; so you will hear little more but of fine equipages
for Flanders: our troops are actually marched, and the
officers begin to follow them-1 hopes they know whither! You
know in the last war in Spain, Lord Peterborough rode
galloping about to inquire for his army.

But to come to more real contests; Handel has set up an
oratorio against the opera @ind succeeds.  He has hired all
the goddesses from farces and the singers of Roast Beef(779)
from between the acts at both theatres, with a man with one
note in his voice, and a girl without ever an one; and so they
sing, and make brave hallelujahs; and the good company encore
the recitative, if it happens to have any cadence like what
they call a tune.  I was much diverted the other night at the
opera; two gentlewoman sat before my sister, and not knowing
her, discoursed at their ease.  Says one, "Lord! how fine Mr.
W. is!" "Yes," replied the other, with a tone of saying
sentences, "some men love to be particularly so, your
petit-maitres-but they are not always the brightest of their
sex.'@-Do thank me for this period! I am sure you will enjoy
it as much as we did.

I shall be very glad of my things, and approve entirely of
your precautions; Sir R. will be quite happy, for there is no
telling YOU how impatient he is for his Dominichin.  Adieu!

(777) This alludes to an engagement, which took place on the
8th of February, near Bologna, between the Spaniards under M.
de Gages, and the Austrians under General Traun, in which the
latter were successful.-D.

(778) With regard to Corsica, of which he had declared himself
King.  By this declaration, which was dated January 30,
Theodore recalled, under pain of confiscation of their
estates, all the Corsicans in foreign service, except that of
the Queen of Hungary, and the Grand Duke of Tuscany.-E.

(779) It was customary at this time for the galleries to call
for a ballad called "The Roast Beef of Old England," between
the acts, or before or after the play.



310 Letter 99
To Sir Horace Mann.
March 3d, 1743.

So, she is dead at last, the old Electress!(780)-well, I have
nothing more to say about her and the Medici; they had
outlived all their acquaintance: indeed, her death makes the
battle very considerable -makes us call a victory what before
we did not look upon as very decided laurels.

Lord Hervey has entertained the town with another piece of
wisdom: on Sunday it was declared that he had married his
eldest daughter the night before to a Mr. Phipps,(781)
grandson of the Duchess of Buckingham.  They sent for the boy
but the day before from Oxford, and bedded them at a day's
notice.  But after all this mystery, it does not turn out that
there is any thing great in this match, but the greatness of
the secret.  Poor
Hervey,(782) the brother, is in fear and trembling, for he
apprehends being ravished to bed to some fortune or other with
as little ceremony.  The Oratorios thrive abundantly-for my
part, they give me an idea of heaven, where every body is to
sing whether they have voices or not.

The Board (the Jacobite Club) have chosen his Majesty's Lord
Privy Seal(783) for their President, in the room of Lord
Litchfield.  Don't you like the harmony of parties? We expect
the parliament will rise this month: I shall be sorry, for if
I am not hurried out of town, at least every body else
will-and who can look forward from April to November? Adieu!
though I write in defiance of having nothing to say, yet you
see I can't go a great way in this obstinacy; but you will
bear a short letter rather than none.

(780) Anna Maria of Medicis, daughter of Cosmo III. widow of
John William, Elector Palatine.  After her husband's death she
returned to Florence, where she died, Feb @ 7 1743, aged
seventy-five, being the last of that family.

(781) Constantine Phipps, in 1767, created Lord Mulgrave in
Ireland.  He married, on the 26th of February, Lepel, eldest
daughter of Lord Hervey, and died in 1775.  Her ladyship was
found dead in her bed, 9th March, 1780, at her son's house in
the Admiralty.-E.


(782) George William Hervey, afterwards second Earl of
Bristol.  He died unmarried, in 1775.-E.

(783) Lord Gower.



 311 Letter 100
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 14, 1743.

I don't at all know how to advise you about mourning; I always
think that the custom of a country, and what other foreign
ministers do, should be your rule.  But I had a private
scruple rose with me: that was, whether you should show so
much respect to the late woman (784) as other ministers do,
since she left that legacy to Quella a Roma.(785)  I mentioned
this to my lord, but he thinks that the tender manner of her
wording it, takes off that exception; however, he thinks it
better that you should write for advice to your commanding
officer.  That will be very late, and you will probably have
determined before.  You see what a casuist I am in ceremony; I
leave the question more perplexed than I found it.

Pray, Sir, congratulate me upon the new acquisition of glory
to my family! We have long been eminent statesmen; now that we
are out of employment we have betaken ourselves to war-and we
have made great proficiency in a short season.  We don't run,
like my Lord Stair, into Berg and Juliers, to seek battles
where we are sure of not finding them-we make shorter marches;
a step across the Court of Requests brings us to engagement.
But not to detain you any longer with flourishes, which will
probably be inserted in my uncle Horace's patent when he is
made a field-marshal; you must know that he has fought a duel,
and has scratched a scratch three inches long on the side of
his enemy-lo Paon! The circumstances of this memorable
engagement were, in short, that on some witness being to be
examined the other day in the House upon remittances to the
army, my uncle said, He hoped they would indemnify him, if he
told any thing that affected himself." Soon after he was
standing behind the Speaker's chair, and Will.  Chetwynd,(786)
an intimate of Bolingbroke, came up to him, What, Mr. Walpole,
are you for rubbing up old sores?" He replied, "I think I said
very little, considering that you and your friends would last
year have hanged up me and my brother at the lobby-door
without a trial."  Chetwynd answered, I would still have you
both have your deserts." The other said, If you and I had,
probably I should be here and you would be somewhere else."
This drew more words, and Chetwynd took him by the arm and led
him out.  In the lobby, Horace said, "We shall be-observed, we
had better put it off till to-morrow."  "No, no, now! now!"
When they came to the bottom of the stairs, Horace said, "I am
out of breath, let us draw here." They drew; Chetwynd hit him
on the breast, but was not near enough to pierce his coat.
Horace made a pass which the other put by with his hand, but
It glanced along his side-a clerk, who had observed them go
out together so arm-in-arm-ly, could not believe it amicable,
but followed them, and came up just time enough to beat down
their swords, as Horace had driven him against a post, and
would probably have run him through at the next thrust.
Chetwynd went away to a surgeon's, and kept his bed the next
day; he has not reappeared yet, but is in no danger.  My uncle
returned to the House, and was so little moved as to speak
immediately upon the Cambrick bill, which made Swinny say,
"That it was a sign he was not ruffled."(787)  Don't you
delight in this duel? I expect to see it daubed up by some
circuit-painter on the ceiling of the saloon at Woolterton.

I have no news to tell you, but that we hear King Theodore has
sent over proposals of his person and crown to Lady Lucy
Stanhope,(788) with whom he fell in love the last time he was
in England.

Princess Buckingham(789) is dead or dying: she has sent for
Mr. Anstis, and settled the ceremonial of her burial.  On
Saturday she was so ill that she feared dying before all the
pomp was come home: she said, "Why won't they send the canopy
for me to see? let them send it, though all the tassels are
not finished."  But yesterday was the greatest stroke of all!
She made her ladies vow to her, that if she should lie
senseless, they would not sit down in the room before she was
dead.  She has a great mind to be buried by her father at
Paris.  Mrs. Selwyn says, "She need not be carried out of
England, and yet be buried by her father." You know that Lady
Dorchester always told her, that old Graham(790) was her
father.

I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken about
the statue; do draw upon me for it immediately, and for all my
other debts to you: I am sure they must be numerous; pray
don't fail.

A thousand loves to the Chutes: a thousand compliments to the
Princess; and a thousand-what? to the Grifona.  Alas! what can
one do? I have forgot all my Italian.  Adieu!

(784) The Electress Palatine Dowager.

(785) She left a legacy to the Pretender, describing him only
by these words, To Him at Rome.

(786) William Chetwynd, brother of the Lord Viscount Chetwynd.
On the coalition he was made Master of the Mint.

(787) Coxe, in his Memoirs of Lord Walpole, gives the
following account of this duel: "A motion being made in the
House of Commons, which Mr. Walpole supported, he said to Mr.
Chetwynd, 'I hope we shall carry this question.' Mr. Chetwynd
replied, 'I hope to see you hanged first!'  'You see me hanged
first!' rejoined Mr. Walpole and instantly seized him by the
nose.  They went out and fought.  The account being conveyed
to Lord Orford, he sent his son to make inquiries; who, on
coming into the House of Commons, found his uncle speaking
with the same composure as if nothing had happened to ruffle
his tamper or endanger his life.  Mr. Chetwynd was wounded."
vol. ii. p. 68.-E.

(788) Sister of Philip, second Earl Stanhope.

(789) Catherine, Duchess of Buckingham, natural daughter of
King James II. by the Countess of Dorchester.  She was so
proud of her birth, that she would never go to Versailles,
because they would not give her the rank of Princess of the
Blood.  At Rome, whither she went two or three times to see
her brother, and to carry on negotiations with him for his
interest, she had a box at the Opera distinguished like those
of crowned heads.  She not only regulated the ceremony of her
own burial, and dressed up the waxen figure of herself for
Westminster Abbey, but had shown the same insensible pride on
the death of her only son, dressing his figure, and sending
messages to her friends, that if they had a mind to see him
lie in state, she would carry them in conveniently by a
back-door.  She sent to the old Duchess of Marlborough to
borrow the triumphal car that had carried the Duke's body.
Old Sarah, as mad and proud as herself, sent her word, "that
it had carried my Lord Marlborough, and should never be
profaned by any other corpse." The Buckingham retorted that,
"she had spoken to the undertaker, and he had engaged to make
a finer for twenty pounds." [See ant`e, p. 204.]

(790) Colonel Graham.  When the Duchess was young, and as
insolent as afterwards, her mother used to say, "You need not
be so proud, for you are not the King's but old Graham's
daughter." It is certain, that his legitimate daughter, the
Countess of Berkshire and  Suffolk, was extremely like the
Duchess, and that he often said with a sneer, "Well, well,
kings are great men, they make free with whom they please! All
I can say is, that I am sure the same man begot those two
women." The Duchess often went to weep over her father's body
at Paris: one of the monks seeing her tenderness, thought it a
proper opportunity to make her observe how ragged the pall is
that lies over the body, (which is kept unburied, to be some
time or other interred in England,)-but she would not buy a
new!



314 Letter 101
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 25, 1743.

Well! my dear Sir, the Genii, or whoever are to look after the
seasons, seem to me to change turns, and to wait instead of
one another, like lords of the bedchamber.  We have had loads
of sunshine all the winter; and within these ten days nothing
but snows, north-east winds, and blue plagues.  The last ships
have brought over all your epidemic distempers: not a family
in London has escaped under five or six ill: many people have
been forced to hire new labourers.  Guernier, the apothecary,
took two new apothecaries, and yet could not drug all his
patients.  It is a cold and fever.  I had one of the worst,
and was blooded on Saturday and Sunday, but it is quite gone:
my father was blooded last night: his is but slight.  The
physicians say that there has been nothing like it since the
year Thirty-three, and then not so bad: in short, our army
abroad would shudder to see what streams of blood have been
let out! Nobody has died of it, but old Mr. Eyres, of Chelsea,
through obstinacy of not bleeding; and his ancient Grace of
York:(791) Wilcox of Rochester(792) succeeds him, who is fit
for nothing in the world, but to die of this cold too.

They now talk of the King's not going abroad: I like to talk
on that side; because though it may not be true, one may at
least be able to give some sort of reason why he should not.
We go into mourning for your Electress on Sunday; I suppose
they will tack the Elector of Mentz to her, for he is just
dead.  I delight in Richcourt's calculation- I don't doubt but
it is the method he often uses in accounting with the Great
Duke.

I have had two letters from you of the 5th and 12th, with a
note of things coming by sea; but my dear child, you are
either run Roman Catholicly devout, or take me to be so; for
nothing but a religious fit of zeal could make you think of
sending me so many presents.  Why, there are Madonnas enough
in one case to furnish a more than common cathedral-I
absolutely will drive to Demetrius, the silversmith's, and
bespeak myself a pompous shrine! But indeed, seriously, how
can I, who have a conscience, and am no saint, take all these
things? You must either let me pay for them, or I will demand
my unfortunate coffee-pot again, which has put you upon
ruining yourself By the way, do let me have it again, for I
cannot trust it any longer in your hands at this rate; and
since I have found out its virtue, I will present it to
somebody, whom I shall have no scruple of letting send me
bales and cargoes, and ship-loads of Madonnas, perfumes,
prints, frankincense, etc.  You have not even drawn upon me
for my statue, my hermaphrodite, my gallery, and twenty other
things, for which I am lawfully your debtor.

I must tell you one thing, that I will not say a word to my
lord of this Argosie, as Shakspeare calls his costly ships,
till it is arrived, for he will tremble for his Dominichin,
and think it will not come safe in all this company-by the
way, will a captain of a man-of-war care to take all? We were
talking over Italy last night- my lord protests, that if he
thought he had strength, he would see Florence, Bologna, and
Rome, by way of Marseilles, to Leghorn.  You may imagine how I
gave in to such a jaunt.  I don't set my heart upon it,
because I think he cannot do it; but if he does, I promise
you, you shall be his Cicerone.  I delight in the gallantry of
the Princess's brother.(793) I will tell you what, if the
Italians don't take care, they will grow as brave and as
wrongheaded as their neighbours.  Oh! how shall I do about
writing to her? Well, if I can, I will be bold, and write to
her to-night.

I have no idea what the two minerals are that you mention, but
I will inquire, and if there are such, you shall have them;
and gold and silver, if they grow in this land; for I am sure
I am deep enough in your debt.  Adieu!  .

P. S. It won't do! I have tried to write, but you would bless
yourself to see what stuff I have been forging for half an
hour, and have not waded through three lines of paper. i have
totally forgot my Italian, and if she will but have prudence
enough to support the loss of a correspondence, which was long
since worn threadbare, we will come to as decent a silence as
may be.

(791) Doctor lancelot Blackburne.  Walpole, in his Memoires,
vol. i. p. 74, calls him "the jolly old archbishop, who had
the manners of a man of quality, though he had been a
buccaneer, and was a clergyman."  Noble, in his continuation
of Granger, treats these aspersions as the effect of malice.
"How is it possible!" he asks, ,that a buccaneer should be so
great a scholar as Blackburne certainly was? he who had so
perfect a knowledge of the classics, as to be able to read
them with the same ease as he could Shakspeare, must have
taken great pains to have acquired the learned languages, and
have had both leisure and good masters." He is allowed to have
been a remarkably pleasant man; and it was said of him, that
"he gained more hearts than souls."-E.

(792)  He was not succeeded by Dr. Wilcox, but by Dr. Herring,
who was elevated, in 1747, to the archbishopric of Canterbury,
and died in 1757.-E.

(793) a Signor Capponi, brother of Madame Grifoni.




315 Letter 102
To Sir Horace Mann.
Monday, April 4, 1743.

I had my pen in my hand all last Thursday morning to write to
you, but my pen had nothing to say.  I would make it do
something to-day though what will come of it, I don't
conceive.

They say, the King does not go abroad: we know nothing about
our army.  I suppose it is gone to blockade Egra, and to not
take Prague, as it has been the fashion for every body to send
their army to do these three years.  The officers in
parliament are not gone yet.  We have nothing to do, but I
believe the ministry have something for us to do, for we are
continually adjourned, but not prorogued.  They talk of
marrying Princess Caroline and Louisa to the future Kings of
Sweden and Denmark; but if the latter(794) is King of both, I
don't apprehend that he is to marry both the Princesses in his
double capacity.

Herring, Of Bangor, the youngest bishop, is named to the see
of York. it looks as if the bench thought the church going out
of fashion; for two or three(795) of them have refused this
mitre.

Next Thursday we are to be entertained with a pompous parade
for the burial of old Princess Buckingham.  They have invited
ten peeresses to walk: all somehow or other dashed with
blood-royal, and rather than not have King James's daughter
attended by princesses, they have fished out two or three
countesses descended from his competitor Monmouth.

There, I am at the end of my tell! If I write on, it must be
to ask questions.  I Would ask why Mr. Chute has left me off
but when he sees what a frippery correspondent I am, he will
scarce be in haste to renew with me again.  I really don't
know why I am so dry; mine used to be the pen of a ready
writer, but whist seems to have stretched its leaden wand over
me too, who have nothing to do with it. I am trying to set up
the noble game of bilboquet against it, and composing a
grammar in opposition to Mr. Hoyle's.  You will some day or
other see an advertisement in the papers, to tell you where it
may be bought, and that ladies may be waited upon by the
author at their houses, to receive any further directions.  I
am 'really ashamed to send this scantling of paper by the
post, over so many seas and mountains: it seems as impertinent
as the commission which Prior gave to the winds,

"Lybs must fly south, and Eurus east,
For jewels for her neck and breast."

Indeed, one would take you for my Chloe, when one looks on
this modicum of gilt paper, which resembles a billet-doux more
than a letter to a minister.  You must take it as the widow's
mite, and since the death of my spouse, poor Mr. News, I
cannot afford such large doles as formerly.  Adieu! my dear
child, I am yours ever, from a quire of the largest foolscap
to a vessel of the smallest gilt.

(794) There was a party at this time in Sweden, who tried to
choose the Prince Royal of Denmark for successor to King
Frederick of sweden.

(795) Dr. Wilcox, Bishop of Rochester, and Dr. Sherlock,
Bishop of Salisbury: the latter afterwards accepted the See of
London.



317 Letter 103
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 14, 1743.

This has been a noble week; I have received three letters at
once from you.  I am ashamed when I reflect on the poverty of
my own!  but what can one do? I don't sell you my news, and
therefore should not be excusable to invent.  I wish we don't
grow to have more news!  Our politics, which have not always
been the most in earnest, now begin to take a very serious
turn.  Our army is wading over the Rhine, up to their middles
in snow.  I hope they will be thawed before their return: but
they have gone through excessive hardships.  The King sends
six thousand more of his Hanoverians at his own expense: this
will be popular-and the six thousand Hessians march too.  All
this will compose an army considerable enough to be a great
loss if they miscarry.  The King certainly goes abroad in less
than a fortnight.  He takes the Duke with him to Hanover who
from thence goes directly to the army.  The Court will not be
great: the King takes only Lord Carteret, the Duke of
Richmond, master of the horse, and Lord Holderness and Lord
Harcourt,(796) for the bedchamber.  The Duchesses of Richmond
and Marlborough,(797) and plump Carteret,(798) go to the
Hague.

His Royal Highness is not Regent: there are to be fourteen.
The Earl of Bath and Mr. Pelham, neither of them in
regency-posts, are to be of the number.

I have read your letters about Mystery to Sir Robert.  He
denies absolutely having ever had transactions with King
Theodore, and is amazed Lord Carteret can; which he can't help
thinking but he must, by the intelligence about Lady W. Now I
can conceive all that affected friendship for Richcourt! She
must have meant to return to England by Richcourt's interest
with Touissant(799) and then where was her friendship? You are
quite in the right not to have engaged with King Theodore:
your character is not-Furibondo.  Sir R. entirely disapproves
all Mysterious dealings; he thinks Furibondo most bad and most
improper, and always did.  You mistook me about Lady W.'s
Lord-I meant Quarendon, who is now Earl of Litchfield, by his
father's death, which I mentioned.  I think her lucky in
Sturges's death, and him lucky in dying.  He had outlived
resentment; I think had almost lived to be pitied.

I forgot to thank you about the model, which I should have
been sorry to have missed.  I long for all the things, and my
Lord more. so.  Am I not to have a bill of lading, or how!


I never say any thing of the Pomfrets, because in the great
city of London the Countess's follies do not make the same
figure as they did in little Florence.  Besides, there are
such numbers here who have such equal pretensions to be
absurd, that one is scarce aware of particular ridicules.

I really don't know whether Vanneschi be dead; he married some
low English woman, who is kept by Amorevoli; so the Abbate
turned the opera every way to his profit.  As to
Bonducci,(200) I don't think I could serve him; for I have no
interest with the Lords Middlesex and Holderness, the two sole
managers.  Nor if I had, would I employ it, 'to bring over
more ruin to the operas.  Gentlemen directors, with favourite
abb`es and favourite mistresses, have almost overturned the
thing in England.  You will plead my want of interest to Mr.
Smith(801) too: besides, we had Bufos here once, and from not
understanding the language, people thought it a dull kind of
dumb-show.  We are next Tuesday to have the Miserere of Rome.
It must be curious! the finest piece of vocal music in the
world, to be performed by three good voices, and forty bad
ones, from Oxford, Canterbury, and the farces!  There is a new
subscription formed for an opera next year, to be carried on
by the Dilettanti, a club, for which the nominal qualification
is having been in Italy, and the real one, being drunk: the
two chiefs are Lord Middlesex and Sir Francis Dashwood, who
were seldom sober the whole time they were in Italy.

The parliament rises next week: every body is going out of
town.  My Lord goes the first week in May; but I shall
reprieve myself till towards August.  Dull as London is in
summer, there is always more company in it than in any one
place in the country.  I hate the country: I am past the
shepherdly age of groves and streams, and am not arrived at
that of hating every thing but what I do myself, as building
and planting.  Adieu!

(796) Simon, second Viscount Harcourt, created an earl in
1749; in 1768 appointed ambassador at Paris, and in 1769 Lord

by overreaching himself, in order to save the life of a

318 Letter 104
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 25, 1743.

Nay, but it is serious! the King is gone, and the Duke with
him.  The' latter actually to the army.  They must sow
laurels, if they design to reap any; for there are no
conquests forward enough for them to come just in time and
finish.  The French have relieved Egra and cut to pieces two
of the best Austrian regiments, the cuirassiers.  This is
ugly! We are sure, you know, of beating the French afterwards
in France and Flanders; but I don't hear that the heralds have
produced any precedents for our conquering them on the other
side the Rhine.(802)  We at home may be excused from trembling
at the arrival of every post; I am sure I shall.  If I were a
woman, should support my fears with more dignity; for if one
did lose a husband or a lover, there are those becoming
comforts, weeds and cypresses, jointures and weeping cupids;
but I have only a friend or two to lose, and there are no
ornamental substitutes settled, to be one's proxy for that
sort of grief.  One has not the satisfaction of fixing a day
for receiving visits of consolation from a thousand people
whom one don't love, because one has lost the only person one
did love.  This is a new situation, and I don't like it.

You will see the Regency in the newspapers.  I think the
Prince might have been of it when my Lord Gower is.  I don't
think the latter more Jacobite than his Royal Highness.

The Prince is to come to town every Sunday fortnight to hold
drawing-rooms; the Princesses stay all the summer at St.
James's-would I did! but I go in three weeks to Norfolk; the
only place that could make me wish to live at St. James's.  My
Lord has pressed me so much, that I could not with decency
refuse: he is going to furnish and hang his picture-gallery,
and wants me.  I can't help wishing that I had never known a
Guido from a Teniers: but who could ever suspect any connexion
between painting and the wilds of Norfolk.

Princess Louisa's contract with the Prince of Denmark was
signed the morning before the King Went; but I don't hear when
she goes.  Poor Caroline misses her man of Lubeck,(803) by his
missing the crown of Sweden.

I must tell you an odd thing that happened yesterday at
Leicester House.  The Prince's children were in the circle:
Lady Augusta(804) heard somebody call Sir Robert Rich by his
name.  She concluded there was but one Sir Robert in the
world, and taking him for Lord Orford, the child went staring
up to him, and said, "Pray, where is your blue string! and
pray what has become of your fat belly?" Did one ever hear of
a more royal education, than to have rung this mob cant in the
child's ears till it had made this impression on her!

Lord Stafford is come over to marry Miss Cantillon, a vast
fortune, of his own religion.  She is daughter of the
Cantillon who was robbed and murdered, and had his house
burned by his cook(805) a few years ago.  She is as ugly as
he; but when she comes to Paris, and wears a good deal of
rouge, and a separate apartment, who knows but she may be a
beauty! There is no telling what a woman is, while she is as
she is.  There is a great fracas in Ireland in a noble family
or two, heightened by a pretty strong circumstance of Iricism.
A Lord Belfield(806) married a very handsome daughter of a
Lord Molesworth.(807)  A certain Arthur Rochfort, who happened
to be acquainted in the family, by being Lord Belfield's own
brother, looked on this woman, and saw that she was fair.
These ingenious people, that their history might not be
discovered, corresponded under feigned names-And what names do
you think they chose?-Silvia and Philander! Only the very same
that Lord Grey(808) and his sister-in-law took upon a parallel
occasion, and which arc printed in their letters!

Patapan sits to Wootton to-morrow for his picture.  He is to
have a triumphal arch at a distance, to signify his Roman
birth, and his having barked at thousands of Frenchmen in the
very heart of Paris. If you can think of a good Italian motto
applicable to any part of his history send it to me.  If not,
he shall have this antique one-for I reckon him a senator of
Rome, while Rome survived,-"O, et Presidium et dulce decus
meum!"  He is writing an ode on the future campaign of this
summer; it is dated from his villa, where he never was, and
being truly in the classic style, "While you, great Sir," etc.
Adieu!

(802) Walpole seems to have forgotten the battle of
Blenheim.-D;

(803) Adolphus Frederick of Holstein, Bishop of Lubeck, was
elected successor, and did succeed to the crown of Sweden.  He
married the Princess Louisa Ulrica of Prussia.

(804) Afterwards Duchess of Brunswick.-D.

(805) Cantillon was a Paris wine-merchant and banker, who had
been engaged with Law in the Mississippi scheme.  He
afterwards brought his riches to England and settled in this
country.  In May 1734, some of his servants, headed by the
cook, conspired to murder him, knowing that he kept large sums
of money in his house.  They killed him, and then set fire to
the house; but the fire was extinguished, and the body, with
the wounds upon it, found.  The cook fled beyond sea; but in
December, three of his associates were tried at the Old Bailey
for the murder, and acquitted.-E.

320 Letter 105
To Sir Horace Mann.
May 4, 1743.

The King was detained four or five days at Sheerness but
yesterday we heard that he was got to Helvoetsluys.  They
talk' of an interview between him and his nephew of Prussia-I
never knew any advantage result from such conferences.  We
expect to hear of the French attacking our army, though there
are accounts of their retiring, which would necessarily
produce a peace-I hope so! I don't like to be at the eve, even
of an Agincourt; that, you know, every Englishman is bound in
faith to expect: besides, they say my Lord Stair has in his
pocket, from the records of the Tower, the original patent,
empowering us always to conquer.  I am told that Marshal
Noailles is as mad as Marshal Stair.  Heavens! twice fifty
thousand men trusted to two mad captains, without one Dr.
Monroe(809) over
                          them!

I am sorry I could give you so little information about King
Theodore; but my lord knew nothing of him, and as little of
any connexion between Lord Carteret and him.  I am sorry you
have him on your
                          hands. He quite mistakes his
province: an adventurer should come hither;(810) this is the
soil for mobs and patriots              it is the country of
the world to make one's fortune - with parts never so scanty,
one's dulness is not discovered, nor one's dishonesty, till
one obtains the post one wanted-and then, if they do not come
to light-why, one slinks into one's green velvet bag,(811) and
lies so snug! I don't approve of your hinting at the
falsehoods(812)              of Stosch's intelligence; nobody
                          regards it but the King , it pleases
him-e basta.

I was not in the House at Vernon's frantic speech;(813) but I
know he made it, and have heard him pronounce several such:
but he has worn out even laughter, and did not make impression
enough on me to remember till the next post that he had
spoken.

I gave your brother the translated paper; he will take care of
it.  Ceretesi is gone to Flanders with Lord Holderness.  Poor
creature!
he was reduced, before he went, to borrow five guineas of Sir
Francis Dashwood.  How will he ever scramble back to Florence?

We are likely at last to have no opera next year: Handel has
had a palsy, and can't compose; and the Duke of Dorset has set
himself strenuously to oppose it, as Lord Middlesex is the
impresario, and must ruin the house of Sackville by a course
of these follies.  Besides what he will lose this year, he has
not paid his share to the losses of the last; and yet is
singly undertaking another for next season, with
                          the almost certainty of losing
between four or five thousand pounds, to which the
deficiencies of the opera generally amount now.  The
                          Duke of Dorset has desired the King
not to subscribe; but Lord Middlesex is so obstinate, that
this will probably only make him lose a
                          thousand pounds more.

The Freemasons are in so low repute now in England, that one
has scarce heard the proceedings at Vienna against them
mentioned.  I believe nothing but a persecution could bring
them into vogue again here.  You know, as great as our follies
are, we even grow tired of them, and are always changing.

(809) Physician of Bedlam-

"Those walls where Folly holds her throne,
And laughs to think Monroe would take her down."-E.

(810) He afterwards came to England, where he suffered much
from poverty and destitution, and was finally arrested by his
creditors and confined in the King,'s Bench prison.  He was
released from thence under the Insolvent Act, having
registered the kingdom of Corsica for the use of his
creditors.  Shortly after this event he died, December 11,
1756, and was buried in the churchyard of St. Anne's, Soho,
where Horace Walpole erected a marble slab to his memory.  He
was an adventurer, whose name was Theodore Anthony, Baron
Newhoff, and was born at Metz, in 1686.  Walpole, who had seen
him, describes him as "a comely, middle-sized man, very
reserved, and affecting much dignity,"-D.

papers in a green velvet bag.

(812) Stosch used to pretend to send over an exact journal of
the life of the Pretender and his sons, though he had been
sent out of Rome at the Pretender's request, and must have
                          had very bad, or no intelligence, of
what passed in that family.

(813) The admiral had recently said, in the House of Commons,
that "there was not, on this side Hell, a nation so burthened
with taxes as England."-E.



322 Letter 106
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 12, 1743.

It is a fortnight since I got any of your letters, but I will
expect two at once.  I don't tell you by way of news, because
you will have had expresses, but I must talk of the great
Austrian victory!(814)  We have not heard the exact
particulars yet, nor whether it was Kevenhuller or lobkowitz
who beat the Bavarians; but their general, Minucci, is
prisoner.  At first, they said Seckendorffe was too; I am glad
he is not: poor man, he has suffered enough by the house of
Austria! But my joy is beyond the common, for I flatter myself
this victory will save us one: we talk of nothing, but its
producing a peace, and then one's friends will return.

The Duchess of Kendal(815) is dead-eighty-five years old: she
was a year older than her late King.  Her riches were immense;
but I believe my Lord Chesterfield will get nothing by her
death-but his wife: (816) she lived in the house with the
duchess, where he had played away all his credit.

Hough,(817) the good old Bishop of Worcester, is dead too.  I
have been looking at the "Fathers in God" that have been
flocking over the way this Morning to Mr. Pelham, who is just
come to his new house.  This is absolutely the ministerial
street Carteret has a house here too; and Lord Bath seems to
have lost his chance by quitting this street.  Old Marlborough
has made a good story of the latter; she says, that when he
found he could not get the privy seal, he begged that at least
they would offer it to him, and upon his honour he would not
accept it, but would plead his vow of never taking a place; in
which she says they humoured him.  The truth is, Lord Carteret
did hint an offer to him, upon which he went with a nolo
episcopari to the King-he bounced, and said, "Why I never
offered it to you:" upon which he recommended my Lord
Carlisle, with equal Success.

Just before the King went, he asked my Lord Carteret, " Well,
when am I to get rid of those fellows in the Treasury?" They
are on so low a foot, that somebody said Sandys had hired a
stand of hackney-coaches, to look like a levee.

Lord Conway has begged me to send you a commission, which you
will oblige me much by executing.  It is to send him three
Pistoia barrels for guns: two of them, of two feet and a half
in the barrel in length; the smallest of the inclosed buttons
to be the size of the bore, hole, or calibre, of the two guns.
The third barrel to be three feet and an inch in length; the
largest of these buttons to be the bore of it; these feet are
English measure.  You will be so good to let me know the price
of them.

There has happened a comical circumstance at Leicester House:
one of the Prince's coachmen, who used to drive the Maids of
Honour, was so sick of them, that he has left his son three
hundred pounds, upon condition that he never carries a Maid of
Honour!

Our journey to Houghton is fixed to Saturday se'nnight; 'tis
unpleasant, but I flatter myself that I shall get away in the
beginning of August.  Direct your letters as you have done all
this winter; your brother will take care to send them to me.
Adieu!

(814) There was no great victory this year till the battle of
Dettingen, which took place in June; but the Austrians
obtained many advantages during the spring over the Bavarians
and the French, and obliged the latter to recross the
Rhine.-D.

(815) Erangard Melusina Schulembergh, the mistress of George
I.  George I. created her Duchess of Munster and Marchioness
of Dungannon in Ireland in 1719; Ind Duchess of Kendal,
Countess of Feversham, and Baroness of Glastonbury. in
England, in 1723.  All these honours were for life only.  He
also persuaded the Emperor to create her Princess of eberstein
in the Roman empire in 1723.-D.

had distinguished himself early in his life by his resistance
to the arbitrary proceedings of James II. against Magdalen
College, Oxford, of which he was the president.  Pope, with
much justice, speaks of "Hough's unsullied mitre."-D. [He was
nominated Bishop of Oxford in 1690; and translated to
Worcester in 1717.]



323 Letter 107
To Sir Horace Mann.
May 19, 1743.

I am just come tired from a family dinner at the Master of the
Rolls;(818) but I have received two letters from you since my
last, and will write to you, though my head aches with maiden
sisters' healths, forms, and Devonshire and Norfolk.  With
yours I received one from Mr. Chute, for which I thank him a
thousand times, and will answer as soon as I get to Houghton.
Monday is fixed peremptorily, though we have had no rain this
month; but we travel by the day of the week, not by the day of
the sky.

We are in more confusion than we care to own.  There lately
came up a highland regiment from Scotland, to be sent abroad.
One heard of nothing but their good discipline and quiet
disposition.  When the day came for their going to the water
side, an hundred and nine of them mutinied, and marched away
in a body.  They did not care to go where it would not be
equivocal for what King they fought.  Three companies of
dragoons are sent after them.  If you happen to hear of any
rising don't be surprised-I shall not, I assure you.  Sir
Robert Monroe, their lieutenant-colonel, before their leaving
Scotland, asked some of the ministry, " "But suppose there
should be any rebellion in Scotland, what should we do for
these eight hundred men?"  It was answered, "Why, there would
be eight hundred fewer rebels there."

"Utor permisso, caudeque pilos ut equinae
Paulatim cello; demo unum, demo etiam unum,
Dum-"

My dear child, I am surprised to hear you enter so seriously
into earnest ideas of my lord's passing into Italy! Could you
think (however he, you, or I might wish it) that there could
be any probability of it? Can you think his age could endure
it, or him so indifferent, so totally disministered, as to
leave all thoughts of what he has been, and ramble like a boy,
after pictures and statues? Don't expect it.

We had heard of the Duke of Modena's command before I had your
letter.  I am glad, for the sake of the duchess, as she is to
return to France.  I never saw any body wish anything more!
and indeed, how can one figure any particle of pleasure
happening to the daughter of the Regent,(819) and a favourite
daughter too, full of wit and joy, buried in a dirty, dull
Italian duchy, with an ugly, formal object for a husband, and
two uncouth sister-princesses for eternal companions? I am so
near the eve of going into Norfolk, that I imagine myself
something in her situation, and married to some Hammond or
Hoste (820) who is Duke of Wootton or Darsingham.  I remember
in the fairy tales where a yellow dwarf steals a princess, and
shows her his duchy, of which he is very proud: among the
blessings of grandeur, of which he makes her mistress, there
is a most beautiful ass for her palfrey, a blooming meadow of
nettles and thistles to walk in, and a fine troubled ditch to
slake her thirst, after either of the above mentioned
exercises.

Adieu! My next will be dated from some of the doleful castles
in the principality of your forlorn friend, the duchy of
Reepham.

(818) William Fortescue, master of the rolls, a relation of
Margaret Lady Walpole. ffortescue was made master of the rolls
in 1741, and continued so until his death in 1749.  He was the
friend and correspondent of Pope, and assisted the poet in
drawing up the humorous report, "Stradling versus Stiles." He
was a man of great humour, talents, and integrity.]

(819) Mademoiselle de Valois, who had made herself notorious
during the regency of her father, by her intrigue with the
Duke of Richelieu.  She consented to marry the Duke of Modena,
in order to obtain the liberty of her lover, who was confined
in the Bastille, for conspiring against the Regent.  The Duke
of Richelieu, in return, followed her afterwards secretly to
Modena.-D.

(820) The Hammonds and Hostes are two Norfolk families, nearly
allied to the Walpoles.



324 letter 108
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, Jan. 4, 1743.

I wrote, this week to Mr. Chute, addressed to you; I could not
afford two letters in one post from the country, and in the
dead of summer.  I have received one from you of May 21st,
since I came I must tell you a smart dialogue between your
father and me the morning we left London: he came to wish my
lord a good journey: I found him in the parlour. "Sir," said
he, "I may ask you how my son does; I think you hear from him
frequently: I never do."  I replied, "Sir, I write him kind
answers; pray do you do so?"  He coloured, and said with a
half mutter, "Perhaps I have lived too long for him!"  I
answered shortly, "Perhaps you have."  My dear child, I beg
your pardon, but I could not help this.  When one loves any
body, one can't help being warm for them at a fair
opportunity.  Bland and Mr. Legge were present-your father
could have stabbed me.  I told your brother Gal, who was glad.

We are as private here as if we were in devotion-. there is
nobody with us now but Lord Edgecumbe and his son.  The Duke
of Grafton and Mr. Pelham come next week, and I hope Lord
Lincoln with them.  Poor Lady Sophia is at the gasp of her
hopes; all is concluded for his match with Miss Pelham.  It is
not to be till the winter.  He is to have all Mr. Pelham and
the Duke of Newcastle can give or settle; unless Lady
Catherine should produce a son, or the duchess should die, and
the duke marry again.

Earl Poulett(821)  is dead, and makes vacant another riband.
I imagine Lord Carteret will have one; Lord Bath will ask it.
I think they should give Prince Charles(822) one of the two,
for all the trouble he saves us. The papers talk of nothing
but a suspension of arms: it seems toward, for at least we
hear of no battle, though there are so many armies looking at
one another.

Old Sir Charles Wager(823) is dead at last, and has left the
fairest character.  I can't help having a little private
comfort, to think that Goldsworthy-but there is no danger.

Madox of St. Asaph has wriggled himself into the see of
Worcester.  He makes haste; I remember him only domestic
chaplain to the late Bishop of Chichester.(824)  Durham is not
dead, as I believe I told you from a false report.

You tell me of dining with Madame de Modene,(824) but you
don't tell me of being charmed with her.  I like her
excessively-I don't mean her person, for she is as plump as
the late Queen; but, sure her face is fine; her eyes vastly
fine! and then she is as agreeable as one should expect the
Regent's daughter to be.  The Princess and she must have been
an admirable contrast; one has all the good breeding of a
French court, and the other all the ease of it.  I have almost
a mind to go to Paris to see her.  She was so excessively
civil to me.  You don't tell me if the Pucci goes into France
with her.

I like the Genoese selling Corsica! I think we should follow
their example and sell France; we have about as good a title,
and very near as much possession.  At how much may they value
Corsica?  at the rate of islands it can't go for much.
Charles the Second sold Great Britain and Ireland to Louis
XIV. for 300,000 pounds. a-year, and that was reckoned
extravagantly dear.  Lord Bolingbroke took a single hundred
thousand for them, when they were in much better repair.

We hear to-day that the King goes to the army on the 15th N.
S. that is, to-day; but I don't tell it you for certain.
There has been much said against his commanding it, as it is
only an army of succour, and not acting as principal in the
cause.  In my opinion, his commanding will depend upon the
more or less probability of its acting at all.  Adieu!

(821) John, first Earl of Poulett, knight of the garter.  He
died, aged upwards of eighty, on the 28th May 1743.-D.

(822) Prince Charles of Lorraine, the queen of Hungary's
general against the French.-D.

(823) This distinguished admiral died on the 24th of May, in
his seventy-seventh year; at which time he was member for West
looe.  A splendid monument was erected to his memory in
Westminster Abbey.-E.

(824) Dr. Waddington.

(825) It was not the Duchess of Modena, but the Duke's second
sister, who went to Florence.



326 letter 109
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, June 10, 1743.

You must not expect me to write you a very composed, careless
letter; my spirits are all in agitation! I am at the eve of a
post that may bring me the most dreadful news! we expect
to-morrow the news of a decisive battle.  Oh! if you have any
friend there, think what apprehensions I (826) must have of
such a post!  By yesterday's letters, our army was within
eight miles of the French, who have had repeated orders to
attack them.  Lord Stair and Marshal Noailles both think
themselves superior, and have pressed for leave to fight.  The
latter call themselves fourscore thousand; ours sixty.  Mr.
Pelham and Lord Lincoln come to Houghton to-morrow, so we are
sure of hearing as soon as possible, if any thing has
happened.  By this time the King must be with them.- My fears
for one or two friends have spoiled me for any English hopes-I
cannot dwindle away the French army-every man in it appears to
my imagination as big as the sons of Anak! I am conjuring up
the ghosts of all who have perished by French ambition, and am
dealing out commissions to these spectres,

"-To sit heavy on their souls to-morrow!"

Alas! perhaps that glorious to-morrow was a dismal yesterday
at least, perhaps it was to me!  The genius of England might
be a mere mercenary man of the world, and employed all his
attention to turn aside cannonballs from my Lord Stair, to
give new edge to his new Marlborough's sword: was plotting
glory for my Lord Carteret, or was thinking of furnishing his
own apartment in Westminster Hall with a new set of
trophies-who would then take care of Mr. Conway? You, who are
a minister, will see all this in still another light, will
fear our defeat, and will foresee the train of
consequences.-Why, they may be wondrous ugly; but till I know
what I have to think about my own friends, I cannot be wise in
my generation.

I shall now only answer your letter; for till I have read
to-morrow's post, I have no thoughts but of a battle.

I am angry at your thinking that I can dislike to receive two
or three of your letters at once.  Do you take me for a child,
and imagine, that though I may like one plum-tart, two may
make me sick?  I now get them regularly; so I do but receive
them, I am easy.

You are mistaken about the gallery; so far from unfurnishing
any part of the house, there are several pictures undisposed
of, besides numbers at Lord Walpole's, at the Exchequer, at
Chelsea, and at New Park.  Lord Walpole has taken a dozen to
Stanno, a small house, about four miles from hence, where he
lives with my lady Walpole's vicegerent.(827)  You may imagine
that her deputies are no fitter than she is to come where
there is In a modest, unmarried girl.(828)

I will write to London for the life of Theodore, though you
may depend upon its being a Grub Street piece, without one
true fact.  Don't let it prevent your undertaking his Memoirs.
Yet I should say Mrs. Heywood,(829) or Mrs. Behn(830) were
fitter to write his history.

How slight you talk of Prince Charles's victory at Brunau! We
thought it of vast consequence; so it was.  He took three
posts afterwards, and has since beaten the Prince of Conti,
and killed two thousand men.  Prince Charles civilly returned
him his baggage.  The French in Bavaria are quite
dispirited-poor wretches! how one hates to wish so ill as one
does to fourscore thousand men!

There is yet no news of the Pembroke.  The Dominichin has a
post of honour reserved in the gallery.  My Lord says, as to
that Dalton's Raphael, he can say nothing without some
particular description of the picture and the size, and some
hint at the price, which you have promised to get.  I leave
the residue of my paper for tomorrow: I tremble, lest I should
be forced to finish it abruptly!  I forgot to tell you that I
left a particular commission with my brother Ned, who is at
Chelsea, to get some tea-seed from the physic-garden; and he
promised me to go to Lord Islay, to know what cobolt and
zingho(831) are, and where they are to be got.

Saturday morning.

The post is come: no battle! Just as they were marching
against the French, they received orders from Hanover not to
engage, for the Queen's generals thought they were inferior,
and were positive against fighting.  Lord Stair, with only the
English, proceeded, and drew out in order; but though the
French were then so vastly superior, they did not attack him.
The King is now at the army, and, they say, will endeavour to
make the Austrians fight.  It wilt make great confusion here
if they do not.  The French are evacuating Bavaria as fast as
possible, and seem to intend to join all their force together.
I shall still dread all the events of this campaign.  Adieu!

(826) Mr. Conway the most intimate friend of Horace Walpole,
was now serving in Lord Stair's army.

(827) Miss Norsa; she was a Jewess, and had been a singer.

(828) Lady Maria Walpole.

(829) Eliza Heywood, a voluminous writer of indifferent
novels; of which the best known is one called "Betsy
Thoughtless."  She was also authoress of a work entitled "The
Female Spectator." - Mrs. Heywood was born in 1693, and died
in 1756.-D.

(830) Mrs. Afra Behn, a woman whose character and writings
were equally incorrect.  Of her plays, which were seventeen in
number, Pope says,

"The stage how loosely does Astrea tread,
Who fairly puts all characters to bed."

Her novels and other productions were also marked with similar
characteristics.  She died in 1689-D.

(831) Cobalt and Zinc, two metallic substances; the former
composed of silver, copper, and arsenic, the latter of tin and
iron.-D.



328 letter 110
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, June 20, 1743.

I have painted the    Raphael to my lord almost as fine as
Raphael himself could; but he will not think of it-. he will
not give a thousand guineas for what he never saw.  I wish I
could persuade him.  For the other hands, he has already fine
ones of every one of them.  There are yet no news of the
Pembroke: we row impatient.

I have made a short tour to Euston this week with the Duke of
Grafton, who came over from thence with Lord Lincoln and Mr.
Pelham.  Lord Lovel and Mr. Coke carried me and brought me
back.  It is one of the most admired seats in England-in my
opinion, because Kent has a most absolute disposition of it.
Kent is now so fashionable, that, like Addison's Liberty, he

"Can make bleak rocks and barren mountains smile."

I believe the duke wishes he could make them green too.  The
house is large and   bad; it was built by Lord Arlington, and
stands, as all old houses do for convenience of water and
shelter, in a hole; so it neither sees, nor is seen: he has no
money to build another.  The park is fine, the old woods
excessively so: they are much grander than Mr. Kent's passion
clumps-that is, sticking a dozen trees here and there, till a
lawn looks like the ten of spades.  Clumps have their beauty;
but in a great extent of country, how trifling to scatter
arbours, where you should spread forests! He is so unhappy in
his heir apparent,(832) that he checks his hand in almost
every thing he undertakes.  Last week he heard a new complaint
of his barbarity.  A tenant of Lord Euston, in
Northamptonshire, brought him his rent: the Lord said it
wanted three and sixpence: the tenant begged he would examine
the account, that it would prove exact-however, to content
him, he would willingly pay him the three and sixpence.  Lord
E. flew into
                            a rage, and vowed he would write
to the Duke to have him turned out of a little place he has in
the post-office of thirty pounds a-year.  The poor man, who
has six children, and knew nothing of my lord's
                            being upon no terms of power with
his father, went home and shot himself!

I know no syllable of news          '. but that my Lady
Carteret is dead at Hanover, and Lord Wilmington dying.  So
there will be to let a first
                            minister's ladyship and a first
lordship of the Treasury.  We have nothing from the army,
though the King has now been there some time.  As new a thing
as it is, we don't talk much about it.

Adieu! the family are gone a fishing: I thought I stayed at
home to write to you, but I have so little to say that I don't
believe you will think so.

(832) George, Earl of Euston, who died in the lifetime of his
father.  He seems to have been a man of the most odious
character.  He has been already mentioned in the course
                            of these letters, upon the
occasion of his marriage with the ill-fated lady Dorothy
Boyle, who died from his ill-treatment of her.  Upon a picture
of lady Dorothy at the Duke of Devonshire's at Chiswick, is
the following touching inscription, written by her mother,
which commemorates her virtues and her fate:-

"lady Dorothy Boyle,
Born May the 14th, 1724.
She was the comfort and joy of her parents, the delight of all
who knew her angelick of temper, and the admiration of all who
saw her beauty.  She was marry'd October the 10th, 1741, and
delivered (by death) from misery, May the 2nd, 1742.  This
picture was drawn seven weeks after her death (from memory) by
her most affectionate mother, Dorothy Burlington."-D.



329 letter 111
To Sir Horace Mann.
Friday noon, July 29, 1743.

I don't know what I write-I am all a flurry of thoughts-a
battle-a victory!  I dare not yet be glad-I know no
particulars of my friends.  This instant my lord has had a
messenger from the Duke of Newcastle, who has sent him a copy
of Lord Carteret's letter from the field of battle.  The King
was in all the heat of the fire, and safe--the Duke is wounded
in the calf of the leg, but slightly; Duc d'Aremberg in the
breast; General Clayton and Colonel Piers are the only
officers of note said to be killed-here is all my trust!  The
French passed the Mayne that morning with twenty-five thousand
men, and are driven back.  We have lost two thousand, and they
four-several of their general officers, and of the Maison du
Roi, are taken prisoners: the battle lasted from ten in the
morning till four.  The Hanoverians behaved admirably.  The
Imperialists(833) were the aggressors; in short, 'In all
public views, it is all that could be wished-the King in the
action, and his son wounded-the Hanoverians behaving well-the
French beaten: what obloquy will not all this wipe out!
Triumph, and write it to Rome! I don't know what our numbers
were; I believe about thirty thousand, for there were twelve
thousand Hessians and Hanoverians who had not joined them.  O!
in my hurry, I had forgot the place-you must talk of the
battle of Dettingen!

After dinner.  My child, I am calling together all my
thoughts, and rejoice in this victory as much as I dare; for
in the raptures of' conquest, how dare I think that my Lord
Carteret, or the rest of those who have written, thought just
of whom I thought? The post comes in tomorrow morning, but it
is not sure that we shall learn any particular certainties so
soon as that.  Well! how happy it is that the King has had
such an opportunity of distinguishing himself'!(834)  what a
figure he will make!  They talked of its being below his
dignity to command an auxiliary army: my lord says it will not
be thought below his dignity to have sought dangers These were
the flower of the French troops: I flatter myself they will
tempt no more battles.  such, and we might march from one end
of France to the other.  So we are in a French war, at least
well begun! My lord has been drinking the healths of Lord
Stair and Lord Carteret: he says, "since it was well done, he
does not care by whom it was done."  He thinks differently
from the rest of the world: he thought from the first, that
France never missed such an opportunity as when they undertook
the German war, instead of joining with Spain against us.  If
I hear any more tomorrow before the post goes out, I will let
you know.  Tell me if this is the first you hear of the
victory: I would fain be the first to give you so much
pleasure.

Saturday morning.

Well, my dear child, all is safe! I have not so much as an
acquaintance hurt.  The more we hear the greater it turns out.
Lord Cholmondeley writes my lord from London that we gained
the victory with only fifteen regiments, not eleven thousand
men, and SO not half in number to the French.  I fancy their
soldiery behaved ill, by the Gallantry of their officers; for
Ranby, the King'S private surgeon, writes that he alone has
150 officers of distinction desperately wounded under his
care.  Marquis Fenelon's son is among the prisoners, and says
Marshal Noailles is dangerously wounded; so is Duc d'Aremberg.
Honeywood's regiment sustained the attack, and are almost all
killed: his natural son has five wounds, and cannot live.  The
horse were pursuing when the letters came away, so there is no
certain account of the slaughter.  Lord Albemarle had his
horse shot under him.  In short, the victory is complete.
There is no describing what one hears of the spirits and
bravery of our men.  One of them dressed himself up in the
belts of three officers, and swore he would wear them as long
as he lived.  Another ran up to Lord Carteret, who was in a
coach near the action the whole time, and said, "Here, my
lord, do hold this watch for me; I have just killed a French
officer and taken it, and I will go take another."

Adieu! my dear Sir: May the rest of the war be as glorious as
the beginning!

(834) Frederick the Great, in his "Histoire de mon Temps,"
gives the Following account of George the Second at the battle
of Dettingen.  "The King was on horseback, and rode forward to
reconnoitre the enemy: his horse, frightened at the
cannonading, ran away with his Majesty, and nearly carried him
into the midst of the French lines: fortunately, one of his
attendants succeeded in stopping him.  George then abandoned
his horse, and fought on foot, at the head of his Hanoverian
battalions.  With his sword drawn, and his body placed in the
attitude of a fencing-master, who is about to make a lunge in
carte, he continued to expose himself, without Circling, to
the enemy's fire."-D.

are all mad-drums, trumpets, bumpers, bonfires! The mob are

331 Letter 112
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, July 4, 1743.

I hear no particular news here, and I don't pretend to send
you the common news; for as I must have it first from London,
you will have it from thence sooner in the papers than in my
letters.  There have been great rejoicings for the victory;
which I am convinced is very considerable by the pains the
Jacobites take to persuade it is not.  My Lord Carteret's
Hanoverian articles have much offended; his express has been
burlesqued a thousand ways.  By all the letters that arrive,
the loss of the French turns out more considerable than by the
first accounts: they have dressed up the battle into a victory
for themselves-I hope they will always have such! By their not
having declared war with us, one should think they intended a
peace.  It is allowed that our fine horse did us no honour -
the victory was gained by the foot. Two of their princes of
the blood, the Prince de Dombes, and the Count d'Eu(836) his
brother, were wounded, and several of their first nobility.
Our prisoners turn out but seventy-two officers, besides the
private men; and by the printed catalogue, I don't think of
great family.  Marshal Noailles's mortal wound is quite
vanished, and Duc d'Aremberg's shrunk to a very slight one.
The King's glory remains in its first bloom.

Lord Wilmington is dead.  I believe the civil battle for his
post will be tough.  Now we shall see what service Lord
Carteret's Hanoverians will do him.  You don't think the
crisis unlucky for him, do you?  If you wanted a treasury,
should you choose to have been in Arlington Street,(837) or
driving by the battle of Dettingen?  You may imagine our Court
wishes for Mr. Pelham.  I don't know any one who wishes for
Lord Bath but himself-I believe that is a pretty substantial
wish.

I have got the Life of King Theodore, but I don't know how to
convey it--I will inquire for some way.

We are quite alone.  You never saw any thing so unlike as
being here five months out of place, to the congresses of a
fortnight in place.  but you know the "Justum et tenacem
propositi virum" can amuse himself without the "Civium ardor!"
As I have not so much dignity of character to fill up my time,
I could like a little more company.  With all this leisure,
you may imagine that I might as well be writing an ode or so
upon the victory; but as I cannot build upon the Laureate's
place till I know whether Lord Carteret or Mr. Pelham will
carry the Treasury, I have vounded my compliments to a slender
collection of quotations against I should have any occasion
for them.  Here are some fine lines from Lord Halifax's (838)
poem on the battle of the Boyne-

"The King leads on, the King does all inflame,
The King!-and carries millions in the name."

Then follows a simile about a deluge, which you may imagine,
but the next lines are very good -

"So on the foe the firm battalions prest,
And he, like the tenth wave, drove on the rest.
Fierce, gallant, young, he shot through every place,
Urging their flight, and hurrying on the chase,
He hung upon their rear, or lighten'd in their face."

The next are a magnificent compliment, and, as far as verse
goes, to be sure very applicable.

"Stop, stop! brave Prince, allay that inner flame;
Enough is given to England and to fame.
Remember, Sir, you in the centre stand;
Europe's divided interests you command,
All their designs uniting in your hand.
Down from your throne descends the golden chain
Which does the fabric of our world sustain,
That once dissolved by any fatal stroke,
The scheme of all our happiness is broke."

Adieu! my dear Sir: pray for peace!

333 Letter 113
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, July 11, 1743.

The Pembroke is arrived! Your brother slipped a slice of paper
into a letter which he sent me from you the other day, with
those pleasant words, "The Pembroke is arrived." I am going to
receive it. I shall be in town the end of this week, only stay
there about ten days, and wait on the Dominichin hither.  Now
I tremble!  If it should not stand the trial among the number
of capital pictures here!  But it must; It will.

O, sweet lady!(839) What shall I do about her letter? I must
answer it-and where to find a penful of Italian in the world,
I know not.  Well, she must take what she can get: gold and
silver I have not, but what I have I give unto her.  Do you
say a vast deal of my concern for her illness, and that I
could not find decompounds and superlatives enough to express
myself.  You never tell me a syllable from my sovereign lady
the princess: has she forgot me? What is become of Prince
Beauvau?(840) is he warring against us? Shall I write to Mr.
Conway to be very civil to him for my sake, if he is taken
prisoner?  We expect another battle every day.  Broglio has
joined Noailles, and Prince Charles is on the Neckar.
Noailles says, "Qu'il a fait une folie, mais qu'il est pr`et
`a la r`eparer."  There is great blame thrown on Baron Ilton,
the Hanoverian General for having hindered the Guards from
en(,aging.  If they had, and the horse, who behaved
wretchedly, had done their duty, it is agreed that there would
be no second engagement.  The poor Duke is in a much worse way
than was at first apprehended: his wound proves a bad one; he
is gross, and has had a shivering fit, which is often the
forerunner of a mortification.  There has been much thought of
making knights-banneret, but I believe the scheme is laid
aside; for, in the first place, they are never made but on the
field of battle, and now it was not thought on till some days
after; and besides, the King intended to make some who were
not actually in the battle.

Adieu! Possibly I may hear something in town worth telling
you.

334 letter 114
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 19.

Here am I come a-Dominichining! and the first thing, I hear
is, that the Pembroke must perform quarantine fourteen days
for coming from the Mediterranean, and a week airing.  It is
forty days, if they bring the plague from Sicily.  I will bear
this misfortune as heroically as I can; and considering I have
London to bear it in, may possibly support it well enough.

The private letters from the army all talk of the King's going
to Hanover, 2nd of August, N. S. If he should not, one shall
be no longer in pain for him; for the French have repassed the
Rhine, and think only of preparing against Prince Charles, who
is marching sixty-two thousand men, full of conquest and
revenge, to regain his own country.  I most cordially wish him
success, and that his bravery may recover what his abject
brother gave up so tamely, and which he takes as little
personal pains to regain.  It is not at all determined whether
we are to carry the war into France.  It is ridiculous enough!
we have the name of war with Spain, without the thing and war
with France, without the name!

The maiden heroes of the Guards are in great wrath with
General Ilton, who kept them out of harm's way.  They call him
"the Confectioner," because he says he preserved them.

The week before I left Houghton my father had a most dreadful
accident: it had near been fatal; but he escaped miraculously.
He dined abroad, and went up to sleep.  As he was coming down
again, not quite awakened, he was surprised at seeing the
company through a glass-door which he had not observed: his
foot slipped, and he, who is now entirely unwieldy and
helpless, fell at once down the stairs against the door,
which, had it not been there, he had dashed himself to pieces,
in a stone hall.  He cut his forehead two inches long to the
pericranium, and another gash upon his temple; but, most
luckily, did himself' no other hurt, and was quite well again
before I came away.

I find Lord Stafford (841) married to Miss Cantillon; they are
to live half the year in London, half in Paris.  Lord Lincoln
is soon to marry his cousin Miss Pelham: it will be great joy
to the whole house of Newcastle.

There is no determination yet come about the Treasury.  Most
people wish for Mr. Pelham; few for Lord Carteret; none for
Lord Bath.  My Lady TOWnshend said an admirable thing the
other day to this last: he was complaining much of a pain in
his side-"Oh!" said she, "that can't be; you have no side."

I have a new cabinet for my enamels and miniatures Just come
home, which I am sure you would like: it is of rosewood; the
doors inlaid with carvings in ivory.' I wish you could see
'It! Are you to be forever ministerial sans rel`ache?  Are you
never to have leave to come and "settle your private affairs,"
as the newspapers call it?

A thousand loves to the Chutes.  Does my sovereign lady yet
remember me, or has she lost with her eyes all thought of m!
Adieu!

335 letter 115
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 31, 1743.

If I went by my last week's reason for not writing to you, I
should miss this post too, for I have no more to tell you than
I had then; but at that rate, there would be great vacuums in
our correspondence.  I am still here, waiting for the
Dominichin and the rest of the things.  I have incredibly
trouble about them, for they arrived just as the quarantine
was established.  Then they found out that the Pembroke had
left the fleet so long before the infection in Sicily began,
and had not touched at any port there, that the admiralty
absolved it.  Then the things were brought up; then they were
sent back to be aired; and still I am not to have them in a
week.  I tremble for the pictures; for they are to be aired at
the rough discretion of a master
of a hoy, for nobody I could send would be suffered to go
aboard.  The city is outrageous; for you know, to merchants
there is no plague so dreadful as a stoppage of their trade.
The regency are so temporizing and timid, especially in this
inter-ministerium, that I am in great apprehensions of our
having the plague an island, so many ports, no power absolute
or active enough to establish the necessary precautions, and
all are necessary! And now it is on the continent too! While
confined to Sicily there were hopes: but I scarce conceive
that it will stop in two or three villages in Calabria.  My
dear child, Heaven preserve you from it! I am in the utmost
pain on its being so near you.  What will you do! whither will
you go, if it reaches Tuscany? Never think of staying in
Florence: shall I get you permission to retire out of that
State, in case of danger? but sure you would not hesitate on
such a crisis!

We have no news from the army: the minister there communicates
nothing to those here.  No answer comes about the Treasury.
All is suspense: and clouds of breaches ready to burst.  now
strange is this jumble! France with an unsettled ministry;
England with an unsettled one; a victory just gained over
them, yet no war ensuing, or declared from either side; our
minister still at Paris, as if to settle an amicable
intelligence of the losses on both sides!  I think there was
Only wanting for Mr. Thompson to notify to them in form our
victory over them, and for Bussy(843) to have civil letters of
congratulation-'tis so well-bred an age!

I must tell you a bon-mot of Winnington.  I was at dinner with
him and Lord Lincoln and Lord Stafford last week, and it
happened to be a maigre day of which Stafford was talking,
though, you may believe, without any scruples; "Why," said
Winnington, "what a religion is yours! they let you eat
nothing, and vet make you swallow every thing!"

My dear child, you will think when I am going to give you a
new commission, that I ought to remember those you give me.
Indeed I have not forgot one, though I know not how to execute
them.  The Life of King Theodore is too big to send but by a
messenger; by the first that goes you shall have it.  For
cobolt and zingho, your brother and I have made all inquiries,
but almost in vain, except that one person has told him that
there Is some such thing in Lancashire; I have written thither
to inquire.  For the tea-trees, it is my brother-'s fault,
whom I desired, as he is at Chelsea, to get some from the
Physic-garden: he forgot it; but now I am in town myself, if
possible, you shall have some seed.  After this, I still know
not how to give you a commission, for you over-execute; but on
conditions uninfringeable, I will give you one.  I have begun
to collect drawings: now, if you will at any time buy me any
that you meet with at reasonable rates, for I will not give
great prices, I shall be much obliged to you.  I would not
have above one, to be sure, of any of the Florentine school,
nor above one of any master after the immediate scholars of
Carlo Maratti.  For the Bolognese school, I care not how many;
though I fear they will be too dear.  But Mr. Chute
understands them.  One condition is, that if he collects
drawings as well as prints, there is an end of the commission;
for you shall not buy me any, when he perhaps would like to
purchase them.  The other condition is, that you regularly set
down the prices you pay; otherwise, if you send me any without
the price, I instantly return them unopened to your brother:
this, upon my honour, I will most strictly perform.

Adieu! write me minutely the history of the plague.  If it
makes any progress towards you, I shall be a most unhappy man.
I am far from easy on our own account here.

(843) Mr. Thompson and the Abb`e de Bussy were the English and
French residents.



336 letter 117
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Aug. 14, 1743.

I should write to Mr. Chute to-day, but I won't till next
post: I will tell you why presently.  Last week I did not
write at all; because I was every day waiting for the
Dominichin, etc. which I at last got last night-But oh!  that
etc.! It makes me write to you, but I must leave it etc. for I
can't undertake to develop it.  I can find no words to thank
you from my own fund; but Must apply an expression of the
Princess Craon's to myself, Which the number of charming
things you have sent me absolutely melts down from the
bombast, of which it consisted when she sent it me. "Monsieur,
votre g`en`erosit`e," (I am not sure it was not "votre
magnificence,") "ne me laisse rien `a d`esirer de tout ce qui
se trouve de pr`ecieux en Angleterre, dans la Chine, et aux
Indes." But still this don't express etc.  The charming Madame
S`evign`e, who was still handsomer than Madame de Craon, and
had infinite wit, condescended to pun on sending her daughter
an excessively fine pearl necklace-"Voil`a, ma fille, un
pr`esent passant tous les pr`esents pass`es et pr`esents!"  Do
you know that these words reduced to serious meaning, are not
sufficient for what you have sent me! If I were not afraid of
giving you all the trouble of airing and quarantine which I
have had with them, I would send them to you back again! It is
well our virtue is out of the ministry!  What reproach it
would undergo! Why, my dear child, here would be bribery in
folio! How would mortals stare at such a present as this to
the son of a fallen minister! I believe half of it would
reinstate us again though the vast box of essences would not
half sweeten the treasury after the dirty wretches that have
fouled it since.

The Dominichin is safe; so is every thing.  I cannot think it
of the same hand with the Sasso Ferrati you sent me.  This
last is not so manier`e as the Dominichin; for the more I look
at it, the more I am convinced it is of him.  It goes down
with me to-morrow to Houghton.  The Andrea del Sarto is
particularly fine! the Sasso Ferriti particularly graceful-oh!
I should have kept that word for the Magdalen's head, which is
beautiful beyond measure.  Indeed, my dear Sir, I am glad,
after my confusion is a little abated, that your part of the
things is so delightful; for I am very little satisfied with
my own purchases.  Donato Creti's(844) copy is a wretched, raw
daub; the beautiful Virgin of the original he has made
horrible.  Then for the statue, the face is not so broad as my
nail, and has not the turn of the antique.  Indeed, La Vall`ee
has done the drapery well, but I can't pardon him the head.
My table I like; though he has stuck in among the ornaments
two vile china jars, that look like the modern japanning by
ladies.  The Hermaphrodite, on my seeing it again, is too
sharp and hard-in short, your present has put me out of humour
with every thing of my own.  You shall hear next week how my
lord is satisfied with his Dominichin.  I have received the
letter and drawings by Crewe.  By the way, my drawings of the
gallery are as bad as any thing of my own ordering.  They gave
Crewe the letter for you at the-office, I believe, for I knew
nothing of his going, or I had sent you the Life of King
Theodore.

I was interrupted in my letter this morning by the Duke of
Devonshire, who called to see the Dominichin.  Nobody knows
pictures better: he was charmed with it, and did not doubt its
Dominichinality.

I find another letter from you to-night of August 6th, and
thank you a thousand times for your goodness about Mr. Conway:
but I believe I told you, that as he is in the Guards, he was
not engaged.  We hear nothing but that we are going to cross
the Rhine.  All we know is from private letters: the Ministry
hear nothing.  When the Hussars went to Kevenhuller for
orders, he said, "Messieurs, l'Alsace est
`a vous; je n'ai point d'autres ordres `a vous donner."  They
have accordingly taken up their residence in a fine chateau
belonging to the Cardinal de Rohan, as Bishop of Strasbourg.
We expect nothing but war; and that war expects nothing but
conquest.

Your account of our officers was very false; for, instead of
the soldiers going on without commanders, some of them were
ready to go without their soldiers.  I am sorry you have such
plague with your Neptune(845) and the Sardinian-we know not of
them scarce.

I really forget any thing of an Italian greyhound for the
Tesi.  I promised her, I remember, a black spaniel-but how to
send it! I did promise one of the former to Marquis Mari at
Genoa, which I absolutely have not been able to get yet,
though I have often tried; but since the last Lord Halifax
died, there is no meeting with any of the breed.  If I can, I
will get her one.  I am sorry you are engaged in the opera.  I
have found it a most dear undertaking.  I was not in the
management: Lord Middlesex was chief.  We were thirty
subscribers, at two hundred pounds each, which was to last
four years, and no other demands ever to be made.  Instead of
that, we have been made to pay fifty-six pounds over and above
the subscription in one winter.  I told the secretary in a
passion, that it was the last money I would ever pay for the
follies of directors.

I tremble at hearing that the plague is not over, as we
thought, but still spreading.  You will see in the papers That
Lord Hervey is dead-luckily, I think. for himself; for he had
outlived the last inch of character.  Adieu!

338 letter 117
To John Chute, Esq.(846)
Houghton, August 20, 1743.

Indeed, my dear Sir, you certainly did not use to be stupid,
and till you give me more substantial proof that you are so, I
shall not believe it.  As for your temperate diet and milk
bringing about such a metamorphosis, I hold it impossible.  I
have such lamentable proofs every day before my eyes of the
stupefying qualities of beef, ale, and wine, that I have
contracted a most religious veneration for your spiritual
nouriture.  Only imagine that I here every day see men, who
are mountains of roast beef, and only seem just roughly hewn
out into the outlines of human form, like the giant-rock at
Pratolino! I shudder when I see them brandish their knives in
act to carve, and look on them as savages that devour one
another.  I should not stare at all more than I do, if yonder
alderman at the lower end of the table was to stick his fork
into his neighbour's jolly cheek, and cut a brave slice of
brown and fat.  Why, I'll swear I see no difference between a
country gentleman and a sirloin; whenever the first laughs, or
the latter is cut, there runs out the same stream of gravy!
Indeed, the sirloin does not ask quite so many questions.  I
have an aunt here, a family piece of goods, an old remnant of
inquisitive hospitality and economy, who, to all intents and
purposes is as beefy as her neighbours.  She wore me so down
yesterday with interrogatories, that I dreamt all night she
was at my ear with who's and why's, and when's and where's,
till at last in my very sleep I cried out, For God in heaven's
sake, Madam, ask me no more questions!

Oh! my dear Sir, don't you find that nine parts in ten of the
world are of no use but to make you wish yourself with that
tenth part? I am so far from growing used to mankind by living
amongst them, that my natural ferocity and wildness does but
every day grow worse.  They tire me, they fatigue me; I don't
know what to do with them; I don't know what to say to them; I
fling open the windows and fancy I want air; and when I get by
myself, I undress myself, and seem to have had people in my
pockets, in my plaits, -and on my shoulders! I indeed find
this fatigue worse in the country than in town, because one
can avoid it there, and has more resources; but it is there
too.  I fear 'tis growing old; but I literally seem to have
murdered a man whose name was Ennui, for his ghost is ever
before me.  They say there is no English word for ennui;(847)
I think you may translate it most literally by what is called
"entertaining people," and "doing the honours:" that is, you
sit an hour with somebody you don't know, and don't care for,
talk about the wind and the weather, and ask a thousand
foolish questions, which all begin with, "I think you live a
good deal in the country," or, "I think you don't love this
thing or that."  Oh! 'tis dreadful!

I'll tell you what is delightful-the Dominichin!(848)  My dear
Sir, if ever there was a Dominichin, if ever there was an
original picture, this is one.  I am quite happy; for my
father is as much transported with it as I am.  It is hung in
the gallery, where are all his most capital pictures, and he
himself thinks it beats all but the two Guido'S.  That of the
Doctors and The Octagon-I don't know if you ever saw them?
What a chain of thought this leads me into! but why should I
not indulge it? I will flatter myself with your, some time or
other, passing a few days with me.  Why must I never expect to
see any thing but Beefs in a gallery which would not yield
even to the Colonna! If I do not most unlimitedly wish to see
you and Mr. Whithed in it this very moment, it is only because
I would not take you from our dear Mann.  Adieu! you charming
people all.  Is not Madam Bosville a Beef? Yours, most
sincerely.

(846) this very lively letter is the first of a series,
hitherto unpublished, addressed by Mr. Walpole to John Chute,
Esq. of the Vine, in the county of Hants.  Mr. Chute was the
grandson of Chaloner Chute, Esq.  Speaker of the House of
Commons to Richard Cromwell's parliament.  On the death of his
brother Anthony, in 1754, he succeeded to the family estates,
and died in 1776.-E.

(847) According to Lord Byron--

"Ennui is a growth of English root,
Though nameless in our language: we retort
The fact for words, and let the French translate
That awful yawn, which sleep cannot abate."

Pictures at Houghton Hall:-
"The Virgin and Child, a most beautiful, bright, and capital
picture, by Dominichino: bought out of the Zambeccari palace
at Bologna by Horace Walpole, junior."-E.




340 Letter 118
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, Aug. 29, 1743.

You frighten me about the Spaniards entering Tuscany: it is so
probable, that I have no hopes against it but in their
weakness.  If all the accounts of their weakness and desertion
are true, it must be easy to repel them.  If their march to
Florence is to keep pace with Prince Charles's entering
Lorrain, it is not yet near: hitherto, he has not found the
passage of the Rhine practicable.  The French have assembled
greater armies to oppose it than was expected.  We are
marching to assist him: the King goes on with the army.  I am
extremely sorry for the Chevalier de Beauvau's(849) accident;
as sorry, perhaps, as the prince or princess; for you know he
was no favourite.  The release of the French prisoners
prevents the civilities which I would have taken care to have
had shown him.  You may tell the princess, that though it will
be so much honour to us to have any of her family it) our
power, vet I shall always be extremely concerned to have such
an opportunity of showing my attention to them.  there's a
period in her own style-"Comment! Monsieur des attentions:
qu'il est poli! qu'il s`cait tOUrner une civilit`e!"

"Ha!(850) la brave Angloise! e viva!"  What would I have given
to have overheard you breaking it to the gallant!  But of all,
commend me to the good man Nykin!  Why, Mamie (851) himself
could not have cuddled up an affair for his sovereign lady
better.

                         I have a commission from my lord to
send you ten thousand thanks for his bronze-. He admires it
beyond measure.  It came down last Friday, on his
birthday,(852) and was placed at the upper end of the gallery,
which was illuminated on the occasion: indeed, it is
incredible what a magnificent appearance it made.  There were
sixty-four candles, which showed all the pictures to great
advantage.  The Dominichin did itself and us honour.  There is
not the least question of its being original: one might as
well doubt the originality of King Patapan!  His patapanic
majesty is not one of the least curiosities of Houghton.  The
crowds that come to see the house stare at him, and ask what
creature it is.  As he does not speak one word of Norfolk,
there are strange conjectures made about him.  Some think that
he is a foreign prince come to marry Lady Mary.  The
disaffected say he is a Hanoverian: but the common people, who
observe my lord's vast fondness for him, take him for his good
genius, which they call his familiar.

You will have seen in the papers that Mr. Pelham is at last
first lord of the Treasury.  Lord Bath had sent over Sir John
Rushout's valet de chambre to Hanau to ask it.  It is a great
question now what side he will take; or rather, if any side
will take him.  It is not yet known what the good folks in the
Treasury will do-I believe, what they can.  Nothing farther
will be determined till the King's return.


(849) Third son of Prince Craon, and knight of Malta.

(850) This relates to an intrigue which was observed in a
church between an English gentleman and a lady who was at
Florence with her husband.  Mr. Mann was desired to speak to
the lover to choose more proper places.

(851) Prince Craon's name for the princess.  She was mistress
of Leopold, the last Duke of Lorrain, who married her to M. de
Beauvau, and prevailed on the Emperor to make him a prince of
the empire.  Leopold had twenty children by her, who all
resembled him; and he got his death by a cold which he
contracted in standing to sea a new house, which he had built
for her, furnished.  The duchess was extremely jealous, and
once retired to Paris, to complain to her brother the Regent;
but he was not a man to quarrel with his brother-in-law for
things of that nature, and sent his sister back.  Madame de
Craon gave into devotion after the Duke's death.

(852) August 26.



341 letter 119
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, Sept. 7, 1743.

My letters are now at their ne plus ultra of nothingness so
you may hope they will grow better again.  I shall certainly
go to town soon, for my patience is worn out.  Yesterday, the
weather grew cold: I put on a new waistcoat for its being
winter's birthday-the season I am forced to love; for summer
has no charms for me when I pass it in the country.

We are expecting another battle, and a congress at the same
time.  Ministers seem to be flocking to Aix la Chapelle: and,
what will much surprise you, unless you have lived long enough
not to be surprised, is, that Lord Bolingbroke has hobbled the
same way too-you will suppose, as a minister for France; I
tell you, no.  My uncle, who is here, was yesterday stumping
along the gallery with a very political march: my lord asked
him whither he was going.  Oh, said he, to Aix la Chapelle.

You ask me about the marrying princesses.  I know not a
tittle.  Princess Louisa(853) seems to be going, her clothes
are bought; but marrying our daughters makes no conversation.
For either of the other two, all thoughts seem to be dropped
of it.  The senate of Sweden design themselves to choose a
wife for their man of Lubeck.  The city, and our supreme
governors, the mob, are very angry that there @is a troop of
French players at Clifden.(854)  One of them was lately
impertinent to a countryman, who thrashed him.  His Royal
Highness sent angrily to know the cause.  The fellow replied,
"he thought to have pleased his Highness in beating one of
them, who had tried to kill his father and had wounded his
brother." This was not easy to answer.

I delight in Prince Craon's exact intelligence!  For his
satisfaction, I can tell him that numbers, even here, would
believe any story full as absurd as that of the King and my
Lord Stair; or that very one, if any body will ever write it
over.  Our faith in politics will match any Neapolitan's in
religion.  A political missionary will make more converts in a
county progress than a Jesuit in the whole empire of China,
and will produce more preposterous miracles.  Sir Watkin
Williams, at the last Welsh races, convinced the whole
principality (by reading a letter that affirmed it), that the
King was not within two miles of the battle of Dettingen.  We
are not good at hitting off anti-miracles, the only way of
defending one's own religion.  I have read -,in admirable
story of the Duke of Buckingham, who, when James II. sent a
priest to him to persuade him to turn Papist, and was plied by
him with miracles, told the doctor, that if miracles were
proofs of a religion, the Protestant cause was as well
supplied as theirs.  We have lately had a very extraordinary
one near my estate in the country.  A very holy man, as you
might be, doctor, was travelling on foot, and was benighted.
He came to the cottage of a poor dowager, who had nothing in
the house for herself and daughter but a couple of eggs and a
slice of bacon.  However, as she was a pious widow, she made
the good man welcome.  In the morning, in taking leave, the
saint made her over to God for payment, and prayed that
whatever she should do as soon as he was gone she might
continue to do all day.  This was a very unlimited request,
and, unless the saint was a prophet too, might not have been
very pleasant retribution.  The good woman, who minded her
affairs, and was not to be put out of her way, went about her
business.  She had a piece of coarse cloth to make a couple of
shifts for herself and child.  She no sooner began to measure
it but the yard fell a-measuring, and there was no stopping
it.  It was sunset before the good woman had time to take
breath.  She was almost stifled, for she was up to her ears in
ten thousand yards of cloth.  She could have afforded to have
sold Lady Mary Wortley a clean shift' of the usual coarseness
she wears, for a groat halfpenny.

I wish you would tell the Princess this story.  Madame
Riccardi, or the little Countess d'Elbenino, will doat on it.
I don't think it will be out of Pandolfini's way, if you tell
it to the little Albizzi.  You see that I have not forgot the
tone of my Florentine acquaintance.  I know I should have
translated it to them: you remember what admirable work I used
to make of such stories in broken Italian.  I have heard old
Churchill tell Bussy English puns out of jest-books:
particularly a reply about eating hare, which he translated,
"j'ai mon ventre plein de poil." Adieu!

(853) Youngest daughter of George the Second.  She was married
in the following October, and died in 1751, at the age of
twenty-seven.-E.

(854) The residence of the Prince of Wales.  This noble
building was burnt to the ground in 1795, and nothing of its
furniture preserved but the tapestry that represents the Duke
of Marlborough's victories.-E.



343 letter 120
To sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, Sept. 17, 1743.

As much as we laughed at Prince Craon's history of the King
and Lord Stair, you see it was not absolutely without
foundation.  I don't just believe that he threatened his
master with the parliament.  They say he gives for reason of
his Quitting, their not having accepted one plan of operation
that he has offered.  There is a long memorial that he
presented to the King, with which I don't doubt but his
lordship will oblige the public.(856)  He has ordered all his
equipages to be sold by public auction in the camp.  This is
all I can tell you of this event, and this is more than has
been written to the ministry here.  They talk of great
uneasinesses among the English officers, all of which I don't
believe.  The army is put into commission.  Prince Charles has
not passed the Rhine, nor we any thing but our time.  The
papers of to-day tell us of a definitive treaty signed by us
and the Queen of Hungary with the King of Sardinia, which I
will flatter myself will tend to your defence.  I am not in
much less trepidation about Tuscany than Richcourt is, though
I scarce think my fears reasonable; but while you are
concerned, I fear every thing.

My lord does not admire the account of the lanfranc; thanks
you, and will let it alone.  I am going to town in ten days,
not a little tired of the country, and in the utmost
impatience for the winter; which I am sure from all political
prospects, must be entertaining to one who only intends to see
them at the length of the telescope.
I was lately diverted with an article in the Abecodario
Pittorico, in the article of William Dobson: it says, "Nacque
nel quartiere d'Holbrons in Inghilterra."(857)  Did the author
take Holborn for a city, or Inghilterra for the capital of the
island of London?  Adieu!

(856) In this memorial Lord Stair complained that his advice
had been slighted, hinted at Hanoverian partialities, and
asked permission to retire, as he expressed it, to his plough.
His resignation was accepted, with marks of the King's
displeasure at the language in which it was tendered.-E.

(857) Charles the First used to call Dobson the English
Tintoret.  He is said to have been the first painter who
introduced the practice of obliging persons who sat to him to
pay half the price in advance.-E.



344 letter 121
To Sir Horace Mann.
Newmarket, Oct. 3, 1743.

I am writing to you in an inn on the road to London.  What a
paradise should I have thought this when I was in the Italian
inns in a wide barn with four ample windows, which had nothing
more like glass than shutters and iron bars ' no tester to the
bed, and the saddles and portmanteaus heaped on me to keep off
the cold.  What a paradise did I think the inn at Dover when I
came back! and what magnificence Were twopenny prints,
saltcellars, and boxes to hold the knives: but the summum
bonum was small-beer and the newspaper.

"I bless'd my stars, and called it luxury!"

Who was the Neapolitan ambassadress (858) that could not live
at Paris, because there was no maccaroni?  Now am I relapsed
into all the dissatisfied repinement of a true English
grumbling voluptuary.  I could find in my heart to write a
Craftsman against the Government, because I am not quite so
much at my ease as on my own sofa.  I could persuade myself
that it is my Lord Carteret's fault that I am only sitting in
a common arm-chair, when I would be lolling in a
p`ech`e-mortel.  How dismal, how solitary, how scrub does this
town look and yet it has actually a street of houses better
than Parma or Modena.  Nay, the houses of the people of
fashion, who come hither for the races, are palaces to what
houses in London itself were fifteen years ago.  People do
begin to live again now, and I suppose in a term we shall
revert to York Houses, Clarendon Houses, etc.  But from that
grandeur all the nobility had contracted themselves to live in
coops of a dining-room, a dark back-room, with one eye in a
corner, and a closet.  Think what London would be, if the
chief houses were in it, as in the cities in other countries,
and not dispersed like great rarity-plums in a vast pudding of
country.  Well, it is a tolerable place as it is! Were I a
physician, I would prescribe nothing but recipe, CCCLXV
drachm.  Linden.  Would you know why I like London so much?
Why if the world must consist of so many fools as it does, I
choose to take them in the gross, and not made into separate
pills, as they are prepared in the country.  Besides, there is
no being alone but in a metropolis: the worst place in the
world to find solitude is in the country: questions grow
there, and that unpleasant Christian commodity, neighbours.
Oh! they are all good Samaritans, and do so pour balms and
nostrums upon one, if one has but the toothache, or a journey
to take, that they break one's head.  A journey to take-ay!
they talk over the miles to you, and tell you, you will be
late and My Lord Lovel says, John always goes two hours in the
dark in the morning, to avoid being One hour in the dark in
the evening.  I was pressed to set out to-day before seven: I
did before nine; and here am I arrived at a quarter past five,
for the rest of the night.

I am more convinced every day, that there is not only no
knowledge of the world out of a great city, but no decency, no
practicable society-I had almost said, not a virtue.  I will
only instance in modesty, which all old Englishmen are
persuaded cannot exist within the atmosphere of Middlesex.
Lady Mary has a remarkable taste and knowledge of music, and
can sing; I don't say, like your sister, but I am sure she
would be ready to die if obliged to sing before three people,
or before One with whom she is not intimate.  The other day
there came to see her a Norfolk heiress: the young gentlewoman
had not been three hours in the house, and that for the first
time of her life, before she notified her talent for singing,
and invited herself up-stairs, to Lady Mary's harpsichord;
where, with a voice
like thunder, and with as little harmony, she sang to nine or
ten people for an hour. "Was ever nymph like Rossvmonde?"-no,
d'honneur.  We told her, she had a very strong voice.  "Lord,
Sir! my master says it is nothing to what it was."  My dear
child, she brags abominably; if it had been a thousandth
degree louder, you must have heard it at Florence.

I did not write to you last post, being overwhelmed with this
sort of people - I will be more punctual in London.  Patapan
is in my lap: I had him wormed lately, which he took famously:
I made it up with him by tying a collar of rainbow-riband
about his neck, for a token that he is never to be wormed any
more.

I had your long letter of two sheets of Sept. 17th, and wonder
at your perseverance in telling me so much as you always do,
when I, dull creature, find so little for you.  I can only
tell you that the more you write, the happier you make me; and
I assure you, the more details the better: I so often lay
schemes for returning to you, that I am persuaded I shall, and
would keep up my stock of Florentine ideas.

I honour Matthew's punctilious observance of his Holiness's
dignity.  How incomprehensible Englishmen are! I should have
sworn that he would have piqued himself on calling the Pope
the w- of Babylon, and have begun his remonstrance, with "you
old d-d-."  What extremes of absurdities! to flounder from
Pope Joan to his Holiness!  I like your reflection, "that
every body can bully the Pope."  There was a humourist called
Sir James of the Peak, who had been beat by a felony, who
afterwards underwent the same operation from a third hand.
"Zound," said Sir James, "that I did not know this fellow
would take a beating!"  Nay, my dear child, I don't know that
Matthews would!

You know I always thought the Tesi comique, pendant que `ca
devroit, `etre tragique.  I am happy that my sovereign lady
expressed my opinion so well-by the way, is De Sade still with
you?  Is he still in pawn by the proxy of his clothes?  has
the Princess as constant retirements to her bedchamber with
the colique and Amenori?  Oh! I was struck the other day with
a resemblance of mine hostess at Brandon to old Sarah.  You
must know, the ladies of Norfolk universally wear periwigs,
and affirm that it is the fashion at London.  "lord! Mrs.
White, have you been ill, that you have shaved your head?"
Mrs. White, in all the days of my acquaintance with her, had a
professed head of red hair: to-day, she had no hair at all
before, and at a distance above her ears, I descried a smart
brown bob, from beneath which had escaped some long strands of
original scarlet--so like old Sarazin at two in the morning,
when she has been losing at Pharoah, and clawed her wig aside,
and her old trunk is shaded with the venerable white ivy of
her own locks.

i agree with you, that it would be too troublesome to send me
the things now the quarantine exists, except the gun-barrels
for Lord Conway, the length of which I know nothing about,
being, as you conceive, no sportsman.  I must send you, with
the Life of Theodore, a vast pamphlet (859) in defence of' the
new administration, which makes the greatest noise.  It is
written, as supposed, by Dr. Pearse,(860) of St. Martin's,
whom Lord Bath lately made a dean; the matter furnished by
him.  There is a good deal of useful ]Knowledge of the famous
change to be found in it, and much more impudence.  Some parts
are extremely fine; in particular, the answer to the
Hanoverian pamphlets, where he has collected the flower of all
that was said in defence of that measure.(861)  Had you those
pamphlets? I will make up a parcel: tell me what other books
you would have: I will send you nothing else, for if I give
you the least bauble, it puts you to infinite expense, which I
can't forgive, and indeed will never bear again: you would
ruin yourself, and there is nothing I wish so much as the
contrary.

Here is a good Ode, written on the supposition of that new
book being Lord Bath's; I believe by the same hand as those
charming ones which I sent you last year: the author is not
yet known.(862)

The Duke of Argyle is dead-a death of how little moment, and
of how much it would have been a year or two ago.(863)  It is
provoking, if one must die, that one can't even die a propos!

How does your friend Dr. Cocchi?  You never mention him: do
only knaves and fools deserve to be spoken of? Adieu!

(858) The Princess of Campoflorido.

(859) Called " Faction Detected."

(860) Mr. Pearse, afterwards Bishop of Bangor.  He was not the
author, but Lord Perceval, afterwards Earl of Egmont.

(861) Sir John Hawkins says, that Osborne the bookseller, held
out to Dr. Johnson a strong temptation to answer this
pamphlet; which he refused, being convinced that the charge
contained in it was unanswerable.-E.

(862) The Ode by Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, beginning,
"Your sheets I've perused."-D.

(863) "Leaving no male issue, Argyle was succeeded in his
titles and estates by his brother, and of late his bitter
enemy, the Earl of Islay.  With all his faults and follies,
Argyle was still brave, eloquent, and accomplished, a skilful
officer, and a princely nobleman."-lord Mahon, vol. iii. p.
271.



347 letter 122
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Oct. 12, 1743.

They had sent your letter of Sept. 24th to Houghton the very
night I came to town.  I did not receive it back till
yesterday, and soon after another, with Mr. Chute's inclosed,
for which I will thank him presently.  But, my dear child, I
can, like you, think Of nothing but your bitter father's
letter.--! and that I should have contributed to it! how I
detest myself!(864)  My dearest Sir, you know all I ever said
to him:(865) indeed, I never do see him, and I assure you that
I would worship him as the Indians do the Devil, for fear-he
should hurt you: tempt you I find he will not.  He is so
avaricious, that I believe,
if you asked for a fish, he would think it even extravagance
to give you a stone: in these bad times, stones may come to be
dear, and if he loses his place and his lawsuit, who knows but
he may be reduced to turn paviour? Oh! the brute! and how
shocking, that, for your sake, one can't literally wish to see
him want bread! But how can you feel the least tenderness,
when the wretch talks of his bad health, and of not denying
himself comforts! It is weakness in you: whose health is
worse, yours or his? or when did he ever deny himself a
comfort to please any mortal? My dear child, what is it
possible to do for you? is there any thing in my power? What
would I not do for you? and, indeed, what ought I not, if I
have done you any disservice?  I don't think there is any
danger of your father's losing his place,(866) for whoever
succeeds Mr. Pelham is likely to be a friend
to this house, and would not turn out one so connected with
it.

I should be very glad to show my lord an account of those
statues you mention: they are much wanted in his hall, where,
except the Laocoon, he has nothing but busts.  For Gaburri's
drawings, I am extremely pleased with what you propose to me.
I should be well content with two of each master.  I can't
well fix any price; but would not the rate of a sequin apiece
be sufficient? to be sure he never gave any thing like that:
when one buys the quantity you mention to me, I can't but
think that full enough, one 'with another.  At
least, if I bought so many as two hundred, I would not venture
to go beyond that.

I am not at all easy from what you tell me of the Spaniards. I
have now no hopes but in the winter, and what it may produce.
I fear ours will be most ugly-the disgusts about Hanover swarm
and increase every day.  The King and Duke have left the army,
which is marching to winter-quarters in Flanders, He will not
be here by his birthday, but it will be kept when he comes.
The parliament meets the 22d of November.  All is distraction!
no union in the Court: no certainty about the House of
Commons: Lord Carteret making no friends, the King making
enemies: Mr. Pelham in vain courting Pitt, etc. Pultney
unresolved.  How will it end?  No joy but in the Jacobites.  I
know nothing more, so turn to Mr. Chute.

My dear Sir, how I am obliged to you for your poem! Patapan is
so vain with it, that he will read nothing else; I only
offered him a Martial to compare it with the original, and the
little coxcomb threw it into the fire, and told me, "He had
never heard of a lapdog's reading Latin; that it was very well
for house-dos and pointers that live in the country, and have
several hours upon their hands: for my part," said he,

"I am so nice, who ever saw
A Latin book on my sofa?
You'll find as soon a primer there
Or recipes for pastry ware.
Why do ye think I ever read
But Crebillon or Calpren`ede?
This very thing of Mr. Chute's
Scarce with my taste and fancy suits,
oh! had it but in French been writ,
'Twere the genteelest, sweetest bit!
One hates a vulgar English poet:
I vow t' ye, I should blush to show it
To women de ma connoissance,
Did not that agr`eable stance.
Cher double entendre! furnish means
Of making sweet Patapanins!"(867)

My dear Sir, your translation shall stand foremost in the
Patapaniana: I hope in time to have poems upon him, and
sayings of his own, enough to make a notable book.  En
attendant, I have sent you some pamphlets to amuse your
solitude; for, do you see, tramontane as I am, and as much as
I love Florence, and hate the country, while we make such a
figure in the world, or at least such a noise in it, one must
consider you other Florentines as country gentlemen.  Tell our
dear Miny that when he unfolds the enchanted carpet, which his
brother the wise Galfridus sends him, he will find all the
kingdoms of the earth portrayed in it.  In short, as much
history as was described on the ever-memorable and wonderful
piece of silk which the puissant White Cat(868) inclosed in a
nutshell, and presented to her paramour Prince.  In short, in
this carpet, which (filberts being out of season) I was
reduced to pack up in a walnut, he will find the following
immense library of political lore: Magazines for October,
November, December; with an Appendix for the year 1741; all
the Magazines for 1742, bound in one volume; and nine
Magazines for 17'43.  The Life of King Theodore, a certain
fairy monarch; with the Adventures of this Prince and the fair
Republic of Genoa.  The miscellaneous thoughts of the fairy
Hervey.  'The Question Stated.  Case of the Hanover Troops; and
the Vindication of the Case.  Faction Detected.  Congratulatory
Letter to Lord Bath.  The Mysterious Congress; and @our Old
England Journals.  Tell Mr. Mann, or Mr. Mann tell himself, that
I would send him nothing but this enchanted carpet, which he
can't pretend to return.  I will accept nothing under
enchantment.  Adieu all ! Continue to love the two Patapans.

(864) Sir Horace Mann in a letter to Walpole, dated Sept.
24th, 1743, gives an account of his father's refusal to give
him any money; and then quotes the following passage from
his father's letter-"He tells me he has been baited by you and
your uncle on my account, which was very disagreeable, and
believes he may charge it to me."-D.

(865) See ant`e, p.325. (letter 108)

 (866) Mr. Robert Mann, father of Sir Horace Mann, had a place
in Chelsea College, under the Paymaster of the Forces.

(867) Mr. Chute had sent Mr. Walpole the following imitation
of an epigram of Martial:

"Issa est passere nequior Catulli,
Issa est pUrior osculo columbae."
Martial, Lib. i, Ep. 110.

"Pata is frolicksome and smart,
As Geoffry once was-(Oh my heart!)
He's purer than a turtle's kiss,
And gentler than a little miss;
A jewel for a lady's ear,
And Mr. Walpole's pretty dear.
He laughs and cries with mirth or spleen;
He does not speak, but thinks, 'tis plain.
One knows his little Guai's as well
As if he'd little words to tell.
Coil'd in a heap, a plumy wreathe,
He sleeps, you hardly hear him breathe.
Then he's so nice, who ever saw
A drop that sullied his sofa?
His bended leg!-what's this but sense?-
Points out his little exigence.
He looks and points, and whisks about,
And says, pray, dear Sir, let me out.
Where shall we find a little wife,
To be the comfort of his life,
To frisk and skip, and furnish means
Of making sweet Patapanins?
England, alas! can boast no she,
Fit only for his cicisbee.
Must greedy Fate then have him all?-
No; Wootton to our aid we'll call-
The immortality's the same,
Built on a shadow, or a name.
He shall have one by Wootton's means,
The other Wootton for his pains."

(868) See the story of the White Cat in the fairy tales.



349 Letter 123
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, Nov. 17, 1743.

I would not write on Monday till I could tell you the King was
come.  He arrived at St. James's between five and six on
Tuesday.  We were in great fears of his coming through the
city, after the treason that has been publishing for these two
months; but it is incredible how well his reception was beyond
what it had ever been before: in short, you would have thought
it had not been a week after the victory at Dettingen.  They
almost carried him into -the palace on their shoulders; and at
night the whole town was illuminated and bonfired.  He looks
much better than he has for these five years, and is in great
spirits.  The Duke limps a little.  The King's reception of
the Prince, who was come to St. James's to wait for him, and
who met him on the stairs with his two sisters and the privy
councillors, was not so gracious-pas un mot-though the
Princess was brought to bed the day before, and Prince George
is ill of the small-pox.  It is very Unpopular!  You will
possibly, by next week, hear great things: hitherto, all is
silence, expectation, struggle, and ignorance.  The birthday
is kept on Tuesday, when the parliament was to have met; but
that can't be yet.

Lord Holderness has brought home a Dutch bride:(869) I have
not seen her.  The Duke of Richmond had a letter yesterday
from Lady Albemarle,(870) at Altona.  She says the Prince of
Denmark is not so tall as his bride, but. far from a bad
figure: he is thin, and not ugly, except having too wide a
mouth.  When she returns, as I know her particularly, I will
tell you more; for the present, I think I have very handsomely
despatched the chapter of royalties.  My lord comes to town
the day after to-morrow.

The opera is begun, but is not so well as last year.  The Rosa
Maricini, who is second woman, and whom I suppose you have
heard, is now old.  In the room of Amorevoli, they have got a
dreadful bass, who, the Duke of Montagu says he believes, was
organist at Aschaffenburgh.

DO you remember a tall Mr. Vernon,(871) who travelled with Mr.
Cotton?  He is going to be married to a sister of Lord
Strafford.

I have exhausted my news, and you shall excuse my being short
to-day.  For the future, I shall overflow with preferments,
alterations, and parliaments.

Your brother brought me yesterday two of yours together, of
Oct. 22 and 27, and I find you still overwhelmed with
Richcourt's folly and the Admiral's explanatory ignorance.  It
is unpleasant to have old Pucci (872) added to your
embarrassments.

Chevalier Ossorio (873) was with me the other morning, and we
were talking over the Hanoverians, as every body does.  I
complimented him very sincerely on his master's great bravery
and success: he answered very modestly and sensibly, that he
was glad amidst all the clamours, that there had been no cavil
to be found with the subsidy paid to his King.  Prince
Lobkowitz makes a great figure, and has all my wishes and
blessings for having put Tuscany out of the question.

There is no end of my giving you trouble with packing me up
cases: I shall pay the money to your brother.  Adieu! Embrace
the Chutes, who are heavenly good to you, and must have been
of great use in all your illness and disputes.

(869) Her name was Mademoiselle Doublette, and she is called
in the Peerages "the niece of M. Van Haaren, of the Province
of Holland."-D.

(870) Lady Anne Lennox, sister of the Duke of Richmond, and
wife of William Anne van Keppel, Earl of Albemarle: she had
been lady of the bedchamber to the Queen; and this year
conducted Princess Louisa to Altona, to be married to the
Prince Royal of Denmark.

(871) Henry Vernon, Esq. a nephew of Admiral Vernon, married
to Lady Henrietta Wentworth, daughter of Thomas, first Earl of
Strafford, of the second creation.-D.

(872) Signor Pucci was resident from Tuscany at the Court of
England.

(873) Chevalier Ossorio was several years minister in England
from the King of Sardinia, to whom he afterwards became first
minister.



 351 Letter 124
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 30, 1743.

I have had two letters from you since I wrote myself This I
begin against to-morrow, for I should have little time to
write.  The parliament opens, and we are threatened with a
tight Opposition, though it must be vain, if the numbers turns
out as they are calculated; three hundred for the Court, two
hundred and five opponents; that is, in town; for, you know,
the whole amounts to five hundred and fifty-eight.  The
division of the ministry has been more violent than between
parties; though now, they tell you, it is all adjusted.  The
Secretary,(874) since his return, has carried all with a high
hand, and treated the rest as ciphers; but he has been so
beaten in the cabinet council, that in appearance he submits,
though the favour is most evidently with him.  All the old
ministers have flown hither as zealously as in former days;
and of the three lev`ees (875) in this street, the greatest is
in this house, as my Lord Carteret told them the other day; "I
know you all go to Lord Orford - he has more company than any
of us-- do you think I can't go to him too?" He is never
sober; his rants are amazing; so are his parts and spirits.
He has now made up with the Pelhams, though after naming to
two vacancies in the Admiralty without their knowledge; Sir
Charles Hardy and Mr. Philipson.  The other alterations are at
last fixed.  Winnington is to be paymaster; Sandys, cofferer,
on resigning the exchequer to Mr. Pelham; Sir John Rushout,
treasurer of the navy; and Harry Fox, lord of the treasury.
Mr. Compton,(876) and Gybbons remain at that board.  Wat.
Plumber, a known man, said, the other day, "Zounds! Mr.
Pultney took those old dishclouts to wipe out the 'treasury,
and now they are going to lace them and lay them up!" It is a
most just idea: to be sure, Sandys and Rushout, and their
fellows, are dishclouts, if dishclouts there are in the world:
and now to lace them!

The Duke of Marlborough has resigned every thing, to reinstate
himself in the old duchess's will.  She said the other day,
"It is very natural: he listed as soldiers do when they are
drunk, and repented when he was sober." So much for news: now
for your letters.

All joy to Mr. Whithed on the increase of his family! and joy
to you; for now he is established in so comfortable a way, I
trust you will not lose him soon-and la Dame s'appelle?

If my Lady Walpole has a mind once in her life to speak truth,
or to foretell,-the latter of which has as seldom any thing to
do with truth as her ladyship has,-why she may now about the
Tesi's dog, for I shall certainly forget what it would be in
vain to remember.  My dear Sir, how should one convey a dog to
Florence! There are no travelling Princes of Saxe Gotha or
Modena here at present, who would carry a little dog in a
nutshell.  The poor Maltese cats, to the tune of how many!
never arrived here; and how should one little dog ever find
its way to Florence! But tell me, and, if it is possible, I
will send it.  Was it to be a greyhound, or of King Charles's
breed?  It was to have been the latter; but I think you told
me that she rather had a mind to the other sort, which, by the
way, I don't think I could get for her.

Thursday, eight o'clock at night.

I am just come from the House, and dined.  Mr. Coke(877) moved
the address, seconded by Mr. Yorke, the lord chancellor's
son.(878)  The Opposition divided 149 against 278; which gives
a better prospect of carrying on the winter easily.  In the
lords' house there was no division.  Mr. Pitt called Lord
Carteret the execrable author of our measures, and sole
minister.(879)  Mr. Winnington replied, that he did not know
of any sole minister; but if my Lord Carteret was so, the
gentlemen of the other side had contributed more to make him
so than he had.

I am much pleased with the prospect you show me of the
Correggio.  My lord is so satisfied with the Dominichin, that
he will go as far as a thousand pounds for the Correggio.  Do
you really think we shall get it, and for that price?

You talk of the new couple, and of giving the sposa a
mantilla: What new couple! you don't say.  I suppose, some
Suares, by the raffle.  Adieu!

(874) Lord Carteret.

(875) Lord Carteret's, Mr. Pelham's, and Lord Orford's.

(876) The Hon.  George Compton, second son of George, fourth
Earl of Northampton.  He succeeded his elder brother James,
the fifth earl, in the family titles and estates in 1754, and
died in 1758.-D.

(877) The only son of Lord Lovel.-D.

(878) Philip Yorke, eldest son of Lord Hardwicke; and
afterwards the second earl of that title.-D.

(879) In Mr. Yorke's MS. parliamentary journal, the words are"an
execrable, a sole minister, who had renounced the British
nation, and seemed to have drunk of the potion described in
poetic fictions."-E.



352 Letter 125
To Sir Horace Mann.
Dec. 15, 1743.

I write in a great fright, lest this letter should come too
late.  My lord has been told by a Dr. Bragge, a virtuoso,
that, some ye(irs ago, the monks asked ten thousand pounds for
our Correggio,(880) and that there were two copies then made
of it: that afterwards, he is persuaded, the King of Portugal
bought the original; he does not know at what price.  Now, I
think it very possible that this doctor, hearing the picture
was to be come at, may have invented this Portuguese history;
but as there is a possibility, too, that it may be true, you
must take all imaginable precautions to be sure it is the very
original-a copy would do neither you nor me great honour.

We have entered upon the Hanoverian campaign.  Last Wednesday,
Waller moved in our House an address to the King, to continue
them no longer in our pay than to Christmas-day, the term for
which they were granted.  The debate lasted till half an hour
after eight at night.  Two young officers (881) told some very
trifling stories against the Hanoverians, which did not at all
add any weight to the arguments of the Opposition; but we
divided 231 to 181.  On Friday,' Lord Sandwich and Lord
Halifax, in good speeches, brought the same motion into the
Lords.  I was there, and heard Lord Chesterfield make the
finest oration I ever did hear.(882)  My father did not speak,
nor Lord Bath.  They threw out the motion by 71 to 36.  These
motions will determine the bringing on the demand for the
Hanoverians for another year in form; which was a doubtful
point, the old part of the ministry being against it, though
very contrary to my lord's advice.

Lord Gower, finding no more Tories were to be admitted,
resigned on Thursday; and Lord Cobham in the afternoon.  The
privy-seal was the next day given to Lord Cholmondeley.  Lord
Gower's resignation is one of the few points in which I am
content the prophecy in the old Jacobite ballad should be
fulfilled-"The King shall have his own again."

The changes are begun, but will not be completed till the
recess, as the preferments will occasion more re-elections
than they can spare just now in the House of Commons.  Sandys
has resigned the exchequer to Mr. Pelham; Sir John Rushout is
to be treasurer of the navy; Winnington, paymaster; Harry Fox,
lord of the treasury: Lord Edgcumbe, I believe, lord of the
treasury,(883) and Sandys, cofferer and a peer.  I am so
scandalized at this, that I will fill up my letter (having
told you all the news) with the first fruits of my
indignation.

VERSES ADDRESSED TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS
ON ITS RECEIVING A NEW PEER,

THou senseless Hall, whose injudicious space,
Like Death, confounds a various mismatched race,
Where kings and clowns, th' ambitious and the mean,
Compose th' inactive soporific scene,

Unfold thy doors!-and a promotion see
That must amaze even prostituted thee!
Shall not thy sons, incurious though they are,
Raise their dull lids, and meditate a stare?
Thy sons, who sleep in monumental state,
To show the spot where their great fathers sate.
Ambition first, and specious warlike worth,
Call'd our old peers and brave patricians forth;
And subject provinces produced to fame
Their lords with scarce a less than regal name.
Then blinded monarchs, flattery's fondled race,
Their favourite minions stamp'd with titled grace,
And bade the tools of power succeed to Virtue's place,
Hence Spensers, Gavestons, by crimes grown great,
Vaulted into degraded Honour's seat:
Hence dainty Villiers sits in high debate,
Where manly Beauchamps, Talbots, Cecils sate
Hence Wentworth,(884) perjured patriot, burst each tie,
Profaned each oath, and gave his life the lie:
Renounced whate'er he sacred held and dear,
Renounced his country's cause, and sank into a Peer.
Some have bought ermine, venal Honour's veil,
When set by bankrupt Majesty to sale
Or drew Nobility's coarse ductile thread
>From some distinguished harlot's titled bed.
Not thus ennobled Samuel!-no worth
from his mud the sluggish reptile forth;
No parts to flatter, and no grace to please,
With scarce an insect's impotence to tease,
He struts a Peer-though proved too dull to stay,
Whence (885) even poor Gybbons is not brush'd away.

Adieu! I am just going to Leicester House, where the Princess
sees company to-day and to-morrow, from seven to nine, on her
lying-in.  I mention this per amor del Signor Marchese Cosimo
Riccardi.(886)

(880) One of the most celebrated pictures of Correggio, with
the Madonna and Child, saints, and angels, in a convent at
Parma.

(881) Captain Ross and Lord Charles Hay.-E.

354 Letter 126
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec. 26, 1743.

I shall complain of        inflammations in my eyes till you
think it is                an excuse for not writing; but your
brother is@My Witness that I have been shut up in a dark room
for this week.  I got frequent colds, which fall upon my eyes;
and then I have bottles of sovereign eye- waters from all my
acquaintance; but as they are Only accidental colds, I never
use any thing but sage, which braces my eye-fibres again in a
few days.  I have had two letters since my last to you; One
Complaining of my silence, and the other acknowledging one
from me after a week's intermission: indeed, I never have been
so long without writing to you - I do sometimes miss two weeks
on any great dearth of news, which is all I have to fill a
letter; for living as I do among people, whom, from your long
absence, you cannot know, should  talk Hebrew to mention them
to you.  Those, that from eminent birth, folly, or parts, are
to be found in the chronicles of the times, I tell you of,
whenever necessity or the King puts them into new lights.  The
latter, for I cannot think the former had any hand in it, has
made
                    Sandys, as I told you, a lord and
cofferer! Lord Middlesex is one of the new treasury, not
ambassador as you heard.  So the Opera-house and White's have
contributed a commissioner and a secretary to the
                    treasury,(887) as their quota to the
government.  It is a period to make a figure in history.

There is a recess of both Houses for a fortnight; and we are
to meet again, with all the quotations and flowers that the
young orators can collect-,ind forcibly apply to the
Hanoverians; with all the malice which the disappointed Old
have hoarded against Carteret, and with all the impudence his
defenders can sell him - and when all that is
                    vented-what then?-why then, things will
just be where they were.

General Wade (888) is made field-marshal, and is to have
command of the army, as it is      supposed, on the King's not
going abroad; but that is not declared .   The French
preparations go on with much more vigour than ours; they not
having a House of Commons to combat all the winter; a campaign
that necessarily engages all the attention of ministers, who
have no great variety of apartments in their understandings.

I have paid your brother the bill I received from you, and
give you a thousand thanks for all the trouble you have had;
most particularly from the plague of hams,(889) from which you
have saved me.  Heavens!  how blank"I should have looked at
unpacking a great case of bacon and wine!  My dear child, be
my friend, and preserve me from heroic presents.  I cannot
possibly at this distance begin a new courtship of regalia;
for I suppose all those hams were to be converted into watches
and toys.  Now it would suit Sir Paul Methuen very well, who
is a knight-errant at seventy-three, to carry on an amour
between a Mrs. Chenevix's(890) shop and a noble collar in
Florence; but alas! I am neither old enough nor young enough
to be gallant, and should ill become the writing of heroic
epistles to a fair mistress in Italy-no, no: "ne sono uscito
con onore, mi pare, e non
voglio riprendere quel impegno pi`u"  You see how rustic I am
grown again!

I knew your new brother-in-law(891) at school, but have not
seen him since.  But your sister was in love, and must
consequently be happy to have him.  Yet I own, I cannot much
felicitate any body that marries for love.  It is bad enough
to marry; but to marry where one loves, ten times worse.
it is so charming at first, that the decay of inclination
renders it infinitely more disagreeable afterwards.  Your
sister has a thousand merits; but they don't count: but then
she has good sense enough to  make her happy, if her merit cannot
make him so.

Adieu! I rejoice for your sake that Madame Royale' is
recovered, as I saw in the papers.

To Sir Horace Mann.

Dear Sir,
I have been much desired by a very particular friend, to
recommend to you Sir William Maynard,(893) who is going to
Florence.  You will oblige me extremely by any civilities you
show him while he stays there; in particular, by introducing
him to the Prince and Princess de Craon, Madame Suares, and
the rest of my acquaintance there, who, I dare say, will
continue their goodness to me, by receiving him with the same
politeness that they received me.  I am, etc.

356 Letter 127
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 24, 1744.

Don't think me guilty of forgetting you a moment, though I
have missed two or three posts.  If you knew the incessant
hurry and fatigue in which I live, and how few 'moments I have
to myself, you would not suspect Me.  You know, I am naturally
indolent, and without application to any kind of business; yet
it is- impossible, in this country, to live in the world, and
be in parliament, and not find oneself every day more hooked
into politics and company, especially inhabiting a house that
is again become the centre of affairs.  My lord becomes the
last resource, to which they are all forced to apply.  One
part of the ministry, you may be sure, do; and for the other,
they affect to give themselves the honour of it too.

Last Thursday I would certainly have written to give you a
full answer to your letter of grief (894) but I was shut up in
the House till past ten at night; and the night before till
twelve.  But I must speak to you in private first.  I don't in
the least doubt but my Lady Walpole and Richcourt would
willingly be as mischievous as they are malicious, If they
could: but, my dear child, it is impossible.  Don't fear from
Carteret's silence to you; he never writes: if that were a
symptom of disgrace, the Duke of' Newcastle would have been
out long ere this: and when the regency were not thought
worthy of his notice, you could not expect it.  As to your
being attached to Lord Orford, that is your safety.  Carteret
told him the other day, "My Lord, I appeal to the Duke of
Newcastle, if I did not tell the King, that it was you who had
carried the Hanover troops." That, too, disproves the
accusation of Sir Robert's being no friend to the Queen of
Hungary.  That is now too stale and old.  However, I will
speak to my lord and Mr. Pelham-would I had no more cause to
tremble for you, than from little cabals! But, my dear child,
when we hear every day of the 'Toulon fleet sailing, can I be
easy for you? or can I not foresee where that must break,
unless Matthews and the wonderful fortune of England can
interpose effectually? We are not without our own fears; the
Brest fleet of twenty-two sail is out at sea; they talk, for
Barbadoes.  I believe we wish it may be thither destined?
Judge what I think; I cannot, nor may write: but I am in the
utmost anxiety for your situation.

The whole world, nay the Prince himself allows, that if Lord
Orford had not come to town, the Hanover troops had been
lost.(895)  They were in effect given up by all but Carteret.
We carried our own army in Flanders by a majority of 112.(896)
Last Wednesday was the great day of expectation: we sat in the
committee on the Hanover troops till twelve at night: the
numbers were 271 to 226.  The next day on the report we sat
again till past ten, the opposition having moved to adjourn
till Monday, on which we divided, 265 to 177.  Then the Tories
all went away in a body, and the troops were voted.

We have still tough work to do: there are the estimates on The
extraordinaries of the campaign, and the treaty of Worms (897)
to come;--I know who (898) thinks this last more difficult to
fight than the Hanover troops.  It is likely to turn out as
laborious a session as ever was.  All the comfort is, all the
abuse don't lie at your door nor mine; Lord Carteret has the
full perquisites of the ministry.  The other day, after Pitt
had called him "the Hanover troop-minister, a flagitious
taskmaster," and said, "that the sixteen thousand Hanoverians
were all the party he had, and were his placemen;" in short,
after he had exhausted invectives, he added, "But I have done:
if he were present, I would say ten times more."(899)  Murray
shines as bright as ever he did at the bar; which he seems to
decline, to push his fortune in the House of Commons under Mr.
Pelham.

This is the present state of our politics, which is our
present state; for nothing else is thought of.  We. fear the
King will again go abroad.

Lord Hartington has desired me to write to you for some
melon-seeds, which you will be so good to get the best, and
send to me for him.

I can't conclude without mentioning again the Toulon squadron:
we vapour and say, by this time Matthews has beaten them,
while I see them in the port of Leghorn!

My dear Mr. Chute, I trust to your friendship to comfort our
poor Miny: for my part, I am all apprehension! My dearest
child, if it turns out so, trust to my friendship for working
every engine to restore you to as good a situation as you will
lose, If my fears prove prophetic! The first peace would
reinstate you in your favourite Florence, whoever were
sovereign of it.  I wish you may be able to smile at the
vanity of my fears, as I did at yours about Richcourt.  Adieu!
adieu!

(894) Sir Horace Mann had written in great uneasiness, in
consequence of his having heard that Count Richcourt, the
Great Duke's minister; was using all his influence with the
English government, in conjunction with Lady Walpole, to have
Sir Horace removed from his situation at Florence.-D.

(895) "Lord Orford's personal credit with his friends was the
main reason that the question was so well disposed of: he
never laboured any point during his own administration with
more zeal, and at a dinner at Hanbury Williams's had a meeting
with such of the old court party as were thought most averse
to concurring in this measure; where he took great pains to
convince them of the necessity there was for repeating it."
Mr. P. Yorke's MS. Journal.-E.

(896) It appears from Mr. Philip Yorke's Parliamentary
Journal, that the letter-writer took a part in the
debate-"Young Mr. Walpole's speech," he says, "met with
deserved applause from every body: it was judicious and
elegant: he applied the verse which Lucan puts in Curia's
mouth to Caesar, to the King:-

"Livor edax tibi cuncta negat, Gallasque subactos,
Vix impune feres."-E.

(897) Between the King of England, the Queen of Hungary, and
the King of Sardinia, to whom were afterwards added Holland
and Saxony.  It is sometimes called "the triple alliance."-D.

(898) Lord Orford.

(899) "Pitt as usual," says Mr. Yorke, in his MS.
Parliamentary Journal, ,fell foul of Lord Carteret, called him
a Hanover troop-minister; that they were his party, his
placemen; that he had conquered the cabinet by their means,
and after being very lavish of his abuse, wished he was in the
House, that he might give him more of it." Tu the uncommon
accuracy of Mr. Walpole's reports of the proceedings in
Parliament, the above-quoted Journal bears strong evidence.-E.



358 Letter 128
To Sir Horace Mann.
Feb. 9, 1744.

I have scarce time to write, or to know what I write.  I live
in the  House of Commons.  We sat on Tuesday till ten at
night, on a Welsh election; and shall probably stay as long
to-day on the same.

I have received all your letters by the couriers and the post:
I am persuaded the Duke of Newcastle is much pleased with your
despatch; but I dare not enquire, for fear he should dislike
your having written the same to me.

I believe we should have heard more of the Brest squadron, if
their appearance off the Land's End on Friday was se'nnight,
steering towards Ireland, had occasioned greater
consternation.  It is incredible how little impression it
made: the stocks hardly fell: though it was then generally
believed that the Pretender's son was on board.  We expected
some invasion; but as they were probably disappointed on
finding no rising in their favour, it is now believed that
they are gone to the Mediterranean.  They narrowly missed
taking the Jamaica fleet, which was gone out convoyed by two
men-of-war.  The French pursued them, outsailed them, and
missed them by their own inexpertness.  Sir John Norris is at
Portsmouth, ready to sail with nineteen
                                men-of-war, and is to be
joined by two more from Plymouth.  We
                                hope to hear that Matthews has
beat the Toulon squadron before they can be joined by the
Brest.  This is the state of our situation.  "le have stopped
the embarkation of the six thousand men for Flanders; and I
hope the King's journey thither, The Opposition fight every
                                measure of supply, but very
unsuccessfully.  When this Welsh election is over, they will
probably go out of town, and leave the rest of the session at
ease.

I think you have nothing to apprehend from the new mine that
is preparing against you.  My lord is convinced it is an idle
attempt and it will always be in his power to prevent any such
thing from taking effect.  I am very unhappy for Mr. Chute's
gout, or for any thing that disturbs the peace of people I
love so much, and that I have such vast reason to love.  You
know my fears for you: pray Heaven they end well!

It is universally believed that the Pretender's son, who is at
Paris, will make the campaign in one of their armies.  I
suppose this will soon produce a declaration of war; and then
France, perhaps, will not find her account in having brought
him as near to England as ever he is like to be.  Adieu! My
Lord is hurrying me down to the House.  I must go!



359 Letter 129
To Sir Horace Mann.
House of Commons, Feb. 16, 1744.

We are come nearer to a crisis than indeed I expected! After
the various reports about the Brest squadron, it has proved
that they are sixteen ships of the line off Torbay; in all
probability to draw our fleet from Dunkirk, where they have
two men-of-war and sixteen large Indiamen to transport eight
thousand foot and two thousand horse, which are there in the
town.  There has been some difficulty to persuade people of
the imminence of our danger - but yesterday the King sent a
message to both Houses to acquaint us that he has certain
information of the young Pretender being in France, and of the
designed invasion from thence, in concert with the disaffected
here.(900)  Immediately the Duke of Marlborough, who most
handsomely and seasonably was come to town on purpose, moved
for an Address to assure the King of standing by him with
lives and fortunes.  Lord Hartington, seconded by Sir Charles
Windham,(901) the convert son of Sir William, moved the same
in our House.  To our amazement, and little sure to their own
honour, Waller and Doddington, supported in the most indecent
manner by Pitt, moved to add, that we would immediately
inquire into the state of the navy, the causes of our danger
by negligence, and the sailing of the Brest fleet.  They
insisted on this amendment, and debated it till seven at
night, not one (professed) Jacobite speaking.  The division
was 287 against 123.  In the Lords, Chesterfield moved the
same amendment, seconded by old dull Westmoreland; but they
did not divide.

All the troops have been sent for in the greatest haste to
London but we shall not have above eight thousand men together
at most.  An express is gone to Holland, and General Wentworth
followed it last night, to demand six thousand men, who will
probably be here by the end of next week.  Lord Stair (902)
has offered the King his service, and is to-day named
commander-in-chief.  This is very generous, and will be of
great use.  He is extremely beloved in the -army, and most
firm to this family.

I cannot say our situation is the most agreeable; we know not
whether Norris is gone after the Brest fleet or not.  We have
three ships in the Downs, but they cannot prevent a landing,
which will probably be in Essex or Suffolk.  Don't be
surprised if you hear that this crown is fought for on land.
As yet there is no rising; but we must expect it on the first
descent.

Don't be uneasy for me, when the whole is at stake.  I don't
feel as if my friends would have any reason to be concerned
for me: my warmth will carry me as far as any man; and I think
I can bear as I should the worst that can happen; though the
delays of the French, I don't know from what cause, have not
made that likely to happen.

The King keeps his bed with the rheumatism.  He is not less
obliged to Lord Orford for the defence of his crown, now he is
out of place, than when he was in the administration.  His
zeal, his courage, his attention, are indefatigable and
inconceivable.  He regards his own life no more than when it
was most his duty to expose it, and fears for every thing but
that.

I flatter myself that next post I shall write you a more
comfortable letter.  I would not have written this, if it were
a time to admit deceit.  Hope the best, and fear as little as
you would do if you were here in the danger.  My best love to
the Chutes; tell them -I never knew how little I was a
Jacobite till it was almost my interest to be one.  Adieu!

(900) "February 13.  Talking upon this subject with Horace
Walpole, he told me confidentially, that Admiral Matthews
intercepted, last summer, a felucca in her passage from Toulon
to Genoa, on board of which were found several papers of great
consequence relating to a French invasion in concert with the
Jacobites; one of them particularly was in the style of an
invitation from several of the nobility and gentry of England
to the Pretender. These papers, he thought had not been
sufficiently looked into and were not laid before the cabinet
council until the night before the message was sent to both
Houses."  Mr. P. York(,@'s Parliamentary Journal.-E.

361 Letter 130
To Sir Horace Mann.
Thursday, Feb. 23, 1744.

I write to you, in the greatest hurry, at eight o'clock at
night, whilst they are all at dinner round me.  I am this
moment come from the House, where we have carried a great
Welsh election against Sir Watkyn Williams by 26. I fear you
have not had my last, for the packet-boat has been stopped on
the French stopping our messenger at Calais.  There is no
doubt of the invasion: the young Pretender is at Calais, and
the Count de Saxe is to command the embarkation.  Hitherto the
spirit of the nation is with us.  Sir John Norris was to sail
yesterday to Dunkirk, to try to burn their transports; we are
in the utmost expectation of the news.  The Brest squadron was
yesterday on the coast of Sussex.  We have got two thousand
men from Ireland, and have sent for two more.  The Dutch are
coming: Lord Stair is general.  Nobody is yet taken up-God
knows why not! We have repeated news of Matthews having beaten
and sunk eight of the Toulon ships; but the French have so
stopped all communication that we don't yet know it certainly;
I hope you do.  Three hundred arms have been seized in a
French merchant's house at Plymouth.  Attempts have been made
to raise the clans in Scotland, but unsuccessfully.

My dear child, I write short, but it is much: and I could not
say more in ten thousand words.  All is at stake we have great
hopes, but they are but hopes!  I have no more time: I wait
with patience for the event, though to me it must and shall be
decisive.



361 Letter 131
To Sir Horace Mann.
March 1st, 1744.

I wish I could put you out of the pain my last letters must
have given you.  I don't know whether your situation, to be at
such a distance on so great a crisis, is not more disagreeable
than ours, who are expecting every moment to hear the French
are landed.  We had great ill-luck last week: Sir John Norris,
with four-and-twenty sail, came within a league of the Brest
squadron, which had but fourteen.  The coasts were covered
with people to see the engagement; but at seven in the evening
the wind changed, and they escaped.  There have been terrible
winds these four or five days . our fleet has not suffered
materially, but theirs less.  Ours lies in the Downs; five of
theirs at Torbay-the rest at La Hague.  We hope to hear that
these storms, which blew directly on Dunkirk, have done great
damage to their transports.  By the fortune of the winds,
which have detained them in port, we have had time to make
preparations; if they had been ready three weeks ago. when the
Brest squadron sailed, it had all been decided.  We expect the
Dutch in four or five days.  Ten battalions, which make seven
thousand men, are sent for from our army in Flanders, and four
thousand from Ireland, two of which are arrived.  If they
still attempt the invasion, it must be a bloody war!

The spirit of the nation has appeared extraordinarily in our
favour.  I wish I could say as much for that of' the ministry.
Addresses are come from all parts, but you know how little
they are to be depended on-King James had them.  The merchants
of London are most zealous: the French name will do more harm
to their cause than the Pretender's service.  One remarkable
circumstance happened to Colonel Cholmondeley's regiment on
their march to London: the public-houses on all the road would
not let them pay any thing, but treated them, and said, "You
are going to defend us against the French." There are no signs
of any rising.  Lord Barrymore,(903) the Pretender's general,
and Colonel Cecil, his secretary of state, are at last taken
up; the latter, who having removed his papers, had sent for
them back, thinking the danger over, is committed to the
Tower, on discoveries from them; but, alas! these discoveries
go on but lamely.(904)  One may perceive who is not minister,
rather than who is. The Opposition tried to put off the
suspension of the Habeas Corpus -feebly.  Vernon (905) and the
Grennvilles are the warmest: Pitt and Lyttelton went away
without voting.(906)  My father has exerted himself most
amazingly - the other day, on the King's laying some
information before the House, when the ministry had determined
to make no address on it, he rose up in the greatest
agitation, and made a long and fine speech On the present
situation.(907)  The Prince was so pleased with it, that he
has given him leave to go to his court, which he never would
before.  He went yesterday, and was most graciously received.

Lord Stair is at last appointed general.  General Oglethorpe
(908) is to have a commission for raising a regiment of
Hussars, to defend the coasts.  The Swiss servants in London
have offered to form themselves into a regiment; six hundred
are already clothed and armed, but no colonel or officers
appointed.  We flatter ourselves, that the divisions in the
French ministry will repair what the divisions in our own
undo.

The answer from the court of France to Mr. Thomson on the
subject of the boy (909) is most arrogant: "that when we have
given them satisfaction for the many complaints which they
have made on our infraction of treaties, then they will think
of giving us des `eclaircissements."

We have no authentic news yet from Matthews: the most credited
is a letter from Marseilles to a Jew, which says it was the
most bloody battle ever fought; that it lasted three days;
that the two first we had the worst, and the third, by a lucky
gale, totally defeated them.  Sir Charles Wager always said,
"that if a sea-fight lasted three days, he was sure the
English suffered the most for the two first, for no other
nation would stand beating for two days together."

Adieu! my dear child.  I have told you every circumstance I
know: I hope you receive my letters; I hope their accounts
will grow more favourable.  I never found my spirits so high,
for they never were so provoked.  hope the best, and believe
that, as long as I am, I shall always be yours sincerely.


P. S. My dear Chutes, I hope you will still return to your own
England.

Cecil's pockets, which gave occasion to the apprehending of
Lord Barrymore.  They were both concerned in the affair of
transmitting the Pretender's letter to the late Duke of

voted with the Ayes.  Lord Chesterfield told the chancellor
there was no opposition to this bill intended amongst the
Lords; not even a disposition to it in any body; and greatly
approved the limiting it to so short a time." Mr. P. Yorke's

(907) "Lord Orford, though he had never spoken in the House of
Lords, having remarked to his brother Horatio that he had left
his tongue in the House of Commons, yet on this occasion his
eloquent voice was once more raised, beseeching their

affection round the throne.  It was solely owing to him, that
the torrent of public opposition was braved and overcome."

excelled in all manly exercises, and was inured to every kind
of toil, especially long marches on foot, having applied
himself to field-sports in Italy, and become an expert walker.
His face was strikingly handsome, of a perfect oval, and a
fair complexion; his eyes light blue; his features high and
noble.  Contrary to the custom of the time, which prescribed
perukes, his own fair hair usually in long ringlets on his
neck.  This goodly person was enhanced by his graceful
manners; frequently condescending to the most familiar
kindness, yet always shielded by a regal dignity: he had a
peculiar talent to please and to persuade, and never failed to
adapt his conversation to the taste or to the station of those
whom he addressed." Hist. vol. iii. p. 280.-E.



363 Letter 132
To Sir Horace Mann.
March 5th, 1744, eight o'clock at night.

I have but time to write you a minute-line, but it will be a
comfortable one.  There is just come advice, that the great
storm on the 25th of last month, the very day the embarkation
was to have sailed from Dunkirk, destroyed twelve of their
transports, and obliged the whole number of troops, which were
fifteen thousand, to debark.  You may look upon the invasion
is at an end, at least for the present; though, as every thing
is coming to a crisis, one shall not be surprised to hear of
the attempt renewed.  We know nothing yet certain from
Matthews; his victory grows a great doubt.

As this must go away this instant, I cannot write more-but
what could be more?  Adieu!  I wish you all joy.



364 Letter 133
To Sir Horace Mann.
March 15th, 1744

I have nothing new to tell you: that great storm certainly
saved us from the invasion-then.(910)  Whether it has put an
end to the design is uncertain.  They say the embargo at
Dunkirk and Calais is taken off, but not a vessel of ours is
come in from thence.  They have, indeed, opened again the
communication with Ypres and Nieuport, etc. but we don't yet
hear whether they have renewed their embarkation.  However, we
take it for granted it is all over-from which, I suppose it
will not be over.  We expect the Dutch troops every hour.
That reinforcement, and four thousand men from Ireland, will
be all the advantage we shall have made of gaining time.

At last we have got some light into our Mediterranean affair,
for there is no calling it a victory.  Villettes has sent a
courier, by which it seems we sunk one great Spanish ship; the
rest escaped, and the French fled shamefully; that was, I
suppose, designedly, and artfully.  We can't account for
Lestock's not coming up with his seventeen ships, and we have
no mind to like it, which will not amaze you.  We flatter
ourselves that, as this was only the first day, we shall get
some more creditable history of some succeeding day.

The French are going to besiege Mons: I wish all the war may
take that turn; I don't desire to see England the theatre of
it. We talk no more of its becoming so, nor of the plot, than
of the gunpowder-treason.  Party is very silent; I believe,
because the Jacobites have better hopes than from
parliamentary divisions,-those in the ministry run very high,
and, I think, near some crisis.

I have enclosed a proposal from my bookseller to the
undertaker of the Museum Florentinum, or the concerners of it,
as the paper called them; but it was expressed in such
wonderfully-battered English, that it was impossible for
Dodsley or me to be sure of the meaning of it. He is a
fashionable author, and though that is no sign of perspicuity,
I hope, more intelligible.  Adieu!

(910) "The pious motto," says Mr. P. Yorke, "upon the medal
struck by Queen Elizabeth after the defeat of the Armada, may,
with as much propriety, be applied to this event-"Flavit

providential events, for which we have much to answer."' MS.

365 Letter 134
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, March 22, 1744.

               I am .sorry this letter must date the era of a
new correspondence, the topic of which must be blood!
Yesterday, came advice from Mr. Thompson,(911) that Monsieur
Amelot had sent for him and given him notice to be gone, for a
declaration of war with England was to be published in two
days.  Politically, I don't think it so bad; for the very name
of war, though in effect, on foot before,, must make
our governors take more precautions; and the French declaring
it will range the people more on our side than on the
Jacobite: besides, the latter will have their communication
with France cut off.  But, my dear child, what lives, what
misfortunes, must and may follow all this! As a man, I feel my
humanity more touched than my spirit-I feel myself more an
universal man than an Englishman! We have
already lost seven millions of money and thirty thousand men
in the Spanish war-and all the fruit of all this blood and
treasure is the glory of having Admiral Vernon's head on
alehouse signs! for my part, I would not purchase another Duke
of Marlborough at the expense of one life.  How I should be
shocked, were I a hero, when I looked on my own laurelled head
on a medal, the reverse of which would be widows and orphans.
How many such will our patriots have made!

The embarkation at Dunkirk does not seem to go on, though, to
be sure, not laid aside.  We received yesterday the
particulars of the Mediterranean engagement from Matthews.  We
conclude the French squadron retired designedly, to come up to
Brest, where we every day expect to hear of them.  If Matthews
does not follow them, adieu our triumphs in the Channel-and
then! Sir John Norris has desired leave to come back, as
little satisfied with the world as the world is with him.  He
is certainly very unfortunate;(912) but I can't say I think he
has tried to correct his fortune.  If England is ever more to
be England, this sure is the crisis to exert all her vigour.
We have all the disadvantage of Queen Elizabeth's prospect,
without one of her ministers.  Four thousand Dutch are landed,
and we hope to get eight or twelve ships from them.  Can we
now say, Quatuor maria vindico?"(913)

I will not talk any more politically, but turn to hymeneals,
with as much indifference as if I were a first minister.  Who
do you think is going to marry Lady Sophia Fermor?(914)-only
Lord Carteret!-this very week!-a drawing-room conquest.  Do
but imagine how many passions will be gratified in that
family! her own ambition, vanity, and resentment-love she
never had any; the politics, management, and pedantry of the
mother, who will think to govern her son-in-law out of
Froissart.(915)  Figure the instructions she will give her
daughter!  Lincoln is quite indifferent, and laughs.  My Lord
Chesterfield says, "It is only another of Carteret's vigorous
measures." I am really glad of it; for her beauty and
cleverness did deserve a better fate, than she was on the
point of having determined for her for ever,.  How graceful,
how charming, and how haughtily condescending she will be!
how, if Lincoln should ever hint past history, she will

"Stare upon the strange man's face,
As one she ne'er had known!"(916)

I wonder I forgot to tell you that Doddington had owned a
match of seventeen years' standing with Mrs. Behan, to whom
the one you mention is sister.

I have this moment received yours of March 10th, and thank you
much for the silver medal, which has already taken its place
in my museum.

I feel almost out of pain for your situation, as by the motion
of the fleets this way, I should think the expedition to Italy
abandoned.  We and you have had great escapes, but we have
still occasion for all Providence!

I am very sorry for the young Sposa Panciatici, and wish all
the other parents joy of the increase of their families.  Mr.
Whithed is en bon train; but the recruits he is raising will
scarce thrive fast enough to be of service this war.  My best
loves to him and Mr. Chute.  I except you three out of my want
of public spirit.  The other day, when the Jacobites and
patriots were carrying every thing to ruin, and had made me
warmer than I love to be, one of them said to me, "Why don't
you love your country?" I replied, "I should love my country
exceedingly,'If it were not for my countrymen."  Adieu!

366 Letter 135
To Sir Horace Mann.
April 2, 1744.

I am afraid our correspondence will be extremely disjointed,
and the length of time before you get my letters will make you
very impatient, when all the world will be full of events; but
I flatter myself that you will hear every thing sooner than by
my letters; I mean, that whatever happens will be on the
Continent; for the danger from Dunkirk seems blown over.  We
declared war on Saturday: that is all I know, for every body
has been out of town for the Easter holidays.  To-morrow the
Houses meet again: the King goes, and is to make a speech.
The Dutch seem extremely in earnest, and I think we seem to
put all our strength in their preparations.

The town is persuaded that Lord Clinton (916) is gone to Paris
to make peace - he is certainly gone thither, nobody knows
why.  He has gone thither every year -all his life, when he
was in the Opposition; but, to be sure, this is a very strange
time to take that journey.  Lord Stafford, who came hither
just before the intended invasion, (no doubt for the defence
of the Protestant religion, especially as his father-in-law,
Bulkeley,(917), was colonel of one of the embarked regiments,)
is gone to carry his sister to be married to a Count de
Rohan,(918) and then returns, having a sign manual for leaving
his wife there.

We shall not be surprised to hear that the Electorate(919) has
got a new master; shall you? Our dear nephew of Prussia will
probably take it, to keep it safe for us.

I had written thus far on Monday, and then my lord came from
New Park: and I had no time the rest of the day to finish it.
We have made very loyal addresses to the King on his speech,
which I suppose they send you.  There is not the least news,
but that my Lord Carteret's wedding has been deferred on Lady
Sophia's falling dangerously ill of a scarlet fever; but they
say it is to be next Saturday.  She is to have sixteen hundred
pounds a-year jointure, four hundred pounds pin-money, and two
thousand of jewels.  Carteret says, he does not intend to
marry the mother and the whole family.  What do you think my
lady intends? Adieu! my dear Sir! Pray for peace.

367 Letter 136
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, April 15, 1744.

I could tell you a great deal of news, but it would not be
what you would expect.  It is not of battles, sieges, and
declarations of war; nor of invasions, insurrections, and
addresses.  It is the god of love, not he of war, who reigns
in the newspapers.  The town has made up a list of six and
thirty weddings, which I shall not catalogue to you; for you
would know, them no more than you do Antilochum, fortemque
Gyan, fortemque Cloanthum.

But the chief entertainment has been the nuptials of our great
Quixote and the fair Sophia.  On the point of matrimony she
fell ill of a scarlet fever, and was given over, while he had
the gout, but heroically sent her word, that if she was well,
he would be so.  They corresponded every day, and he used to
plague the cabinet council with reading her letters to them.
Last night they were married; and as all he does must have a
particular air in it, they supped at Lord Pomfret's: at
twelve, Lady Granville, his mother, and all his family went to
bed, but the porter: then my lord went home, and waited for
her in the lodge: she came alone in a hackney-chair, met him
in the hall, and was led up the back stairs to bed.  What is
ridiculously lucky is, that Lord Lincoln goes into waiting,
to-day, and will be to present her!  On Tuesday she stands
godmother with the King to Lady Dysart's(920) child, her new
grand-daughter.  I am impatient to see the whole m`enage; it
will be admirable.  There is a wild young Venetian
ambassadress(921) come, who is reckoned very pretty.  I don't
think so; she is foolish and childish to a degree.  She said,
"Lord! the old secretary is going to be married!"  hey told
her he was but fifty-four. "But fifty-four! why," said she,
"my husband is but two-and-forty, and I think him the oldest
man in the world." Did I tell you that Lord Holderness(922)
goes to Venice with the compliments of accommodation, and
leaves Sir James Grey resident there?

The invasion from Dunkirk seems laid aside.  We talk little of
our fleets - Sir John Norris has resigned -. Lestock is coming
home, and sent before him great complaints of Matthews; so
that affair must be cleared up.  the King talks much of going
abroad, which will not be very prudent.  The campaign is not
opened yet, but I suppose will disclose at once with great
`eclat in several quarters.

I this instant receive your letter of March 31st, with the
simple Demetrius, for which, however, I thank you.  I hope by
this time you have received all my letters, and are at peace
about the invasion; which we think so much over, that the
Opposition are now breaking out about the Dutch troops, and
call it the worst measure ever taken.  Those terms so
generally dealt to every measure successively, will at least
soften the Hanoverian history.

Adieu!  I have nothing more to tell you: I flatter myself you
content yourself with news; I cannot write sentences nor
sentiments.  My best love to the Chutes, and now and then let
my friends the Prince and Princess and Florentines know that I
shall never forget their goodness to me.  What is become of
Prince Beauvau?

369 Letter 137
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, May 8, 1744.

I begin to breathe a little at ease; we have done with the
Parliament for this year: it rises on Saturday.  We have had
but one material day lately, last Thursday.  The Opposition
had brought in a bill to make it treason to correspond with
the young Pretenders:(923) the Lords added a clause, after a
long debate, to make it a forfeiture of estates, as it is for
dealing with the father.  We sat till one in the morning, and
then carried it by 255 to 106.  It was the best debate I ever
heard.(924)  The King goes to Kensington to-morrow, and not
abroad.  We hear of great quarrels between Marshal Wade and
Duc d'Aremberg.  The French King is at Valenciennes with
Monsieur de Noailles, who is now looked upon as first
minister.  He is the least dangerous for us of all.  It is
affirmed that Cardinal Tencin is disgraced, who was the very
worst for us.  If he is, we shall at least have no invasion
this summer.  Successors of ministers seldom take up the
schemes of their predecessors; especially such as by failing
caused their ruin, which, I believe, was Tencin's case at
Dunkirk.

For a week we heard of the affair at Villafranca in a worse
light than was true: it certainly turns out ill for both
sides.  Though the French have had such a bloody loss, I
cannot but think they will carry their point, and force their
passage into Italy.


We have no domestic news, but Lord Lovel's being created Earl
of Leicester, on an old promise which my father had obtained
for him.  Earl Berkeley(925) is married to Miss Drax, a very
pretty maid of honour to the Princess; and the Viscount
Fitzwilliam(926) to Sir Matthew Decker's eldest daughter , but
these are people I am sure you don't know.

There is to be a great ball tomorrow at the Duchess of
Richmond's for my Lady Carteret: the Prince is to be there.
Carteret's court to pay her the highest honours, which she
receives with the highest state.  I have seen her but once,
and found her just what I expected, tr`es grande dame; full of
herself, and yet not with an air of happiness.  She looks ill
and is grown lean, but is still the finest figure in the
world.  The mother is not so exalted as I expected- I fancy
Carteret has kept his resolution, and does not marry her too.

My Lord does not talk of' going out of town yet; I don't
propose to be at Houghton till August.  Adieu!

(923) Charles Edward, and Henry his brother, afterwards the
Cardinal of York.-D.

(924) The Honourable Philip Yorke, in his MS.  Parliamentary
Journal, says, "it was a warm and long d(.-bate, in which I
think as much violence and dislike to the proposition was
shown by the opposers, as in any which had arisen during the
whole winter.  I thought neither Mr. Pelham's nor Pitt's
performances equal on this occasion to what they are on most
others.  Many of the Prince's friends were absent; for what
reason I cannot learn.  This was the parting blow of the
session; for the King came and dismissed us on the 12th, and
the Parliament broke up with a good deal of ill-humour and
discontent on the part of the Opposition, and little
expectation in those who knew the interior of the court, and
the unconnected state of the alliance abroad, that much would
be done in the ensuing campaign to allay it, or infuse a
better temper into the nation."-E.

370 Letter 138
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, May 29, 1744.

Since I wrote I have received two from you of May 6th and
19th.  I am extremely sorry you get mine so late.  I have
desired your brother to complain to Mr. Preverau: I get yours
pretty regularly.

I have this morning had a letter from Mr. Conway at the army;
he says he hears just then that the French have declared war
against the Dutch: they had in effect before by besieging
Menin, which siege our army is in full march to raise.  They
have laid bridges over the Scheldt, and intend to force the
French to a battle.  The latter are almost double our number,
but their desertion is prodigious, and their troops extremely
bad.  Fourteen thousand more Dutch are ordered, and their six
thousand are going from hence with four more of ours; so we
seem to have no more apprehensions of an invasion.  All
thoughts of it are over! no inquiry made into it! The present
ministry fear the detection of conspiracies more than the
thing itself: that is, they fear every thing that they are to
do themselves.

My father has been extremely ill, from a cold he caught last
week at New-park.  Princess Emily came thither to fish, and
he, who is grown quite indolent, and has not been out of a hot
room this twelve- month, sat an hour and a half by the water
side.  He was in great danger one day, and more low-spirited
than ever I knew him, though I think that grows upon him with
his infirmities.  My sister was at his bedside; I came into
the room,-he burst into tears and could not speak to me - but
he is quite well now; though I cannot say I think he will
preserve his life long, as he has laid aside all exercise,
which has been of such vast service to him.  he talked the
other day of shutting himself up in the farthest wing at
Houghton; I said, "Dear, my Lord, you will be at a distance
from all the family there!" He replied, "So much the better!"

Pope is given over with a dropsy, which is mounted into his
head: in an evening he is not in his senses; the other day at
Chiswick, he said,- to my Lady Burlington, "Look at our
Saviour there! how ill they have crucified him!"(927)

There is a Prince of Ost-Frize(928) dead, which is likely to
occasion most unlucky broils: Holland, Prussia, and Denmark
have all pretensions to his succession; but Prussia is
determined to make his good.  If the Dutch don't dispute it,
he will be too near a neighbour; if they do, we lose his
neutrality, which is now so material.

The town has been in a great bustle about a private match; but
which, by the ingenuity of the ministry, has been made
politics.  Mr. Fox fell in love with Lady Caroline
Lennox;(929) asked her, was refused, and stole her.  His
father(930) was a footman; her great grandfather a king: hinc
illae, lachrymae! all the blood royal have been up in arms.
The Duke of Marlborough, who was a friend of the Richmonds,
gave her away.  If his Majesty's Princess Caroline had been
stolen, there could not have been more noise made.  The
Pelhams, who arc much attached to the Richmonds, but who have
tried to make Fox and all that set theirs, wisely entered into
the quarrel, and now don't know how to get out of it.  They
were for hindering Williams,(931) who is Fox's great friend,
and at whose house they were married, from having the red
riband; but he has got it, with four others, the Viscount
Fitzwilliam, Calthorpe, Whitmore, and Harbord.  Dashwood, Lady
Carteret's quondam lover, has stolen a great fortune, a Miss
Bateman; the marriage had been proposed, but the fathers could
not agree on the terms.

I am much obliged to you for all your Sardinian and Neapolitan
journals.  I am impatient for the conquest of Naples, and have
no notion of neglecting sure things, which may serve by way of
d`edommagement.

I am very sorry I recommended such a troublesome booby to you.
Indeed, dear Mr. Chute, I never saw him, but was pressed by
Mr. Selwyn, whose brother's friend he is, to give him that
letter to you.  I now hear that he is a warm Jacobite; I
suppose you somehow disobliged him politically.

We are now mad about tar-water, on the publication of a book
that I will send you, written by Dr. Berkeley, Bishop of
Cloyne.(932)  The book contains every subject from tar-water
to the Trinity; however, all the women read, and understand it
no more than they would if it were intelligible.  A man came
into an apothecary's shop the other day, "Do you sell
tar-water?"  "Tar-water!" replied the apothecary, "why, I sell
nothing else!" Adieu!

(927) Pope died the day after this letter was written; "in the
evening," says Spence, "but they did not know the exact time;
for his departure was so easy, that it was imperceptible even
to the standers by."

(929) Eldest daughter of Charles Duke of Richmond, grandson of
King Charles II.

(932) Having cured himself of a nervous colic by the use of
tar-water, the bishop this year published a book entitled
"Philosophical Reflections and Enquiries concerning the
Virtues of Tar-water.',-E.



372 Letter 139
To Sir Horace Mann.
June 11, 1744.

Perhaps you expect to hear of great triumphs and victories; of
General Wade grown into a Duke of Marlborough; or of the King
being in Flanders, with the second part of the battle of
Dettingen-why, ay: you are bound in conscience, as a good
Englishman, to expect all this -but what if all these 10
paeans should be played to the Dunkirk tune?  I must prepare
you for some such thing; for unless the French are as much
their own foes as we are our own, I don't see what should
hinder the festival to-day(933) being kept next year a day
sooner.  But I will draw no consequences; only sketch you out
our present situation: and if Cardinal Tencin can miss making
his use of it, we may burn our books and live hereafter upon
good fortune.

The French King's army is at least ninety thousand strong; has
taken Menin already, and Ypres almost.  Remains then only
Ostend; which you will look in the map and see does not lie in
the high road to the conquest of the Austrian Netherlands.
Ostend may be laid under water, and the taking it an affair of
time.  But there lies all our train of artillery Which cost
two hundred thousand pounds; and what becomes of our
communication with our army? Why, they may go round by
Williamstadt, and be in England just time enough to be some
other body's army! It turns out that the whole combined army,
English, Dutch, Austrians, and Hanoverians, does not amount to
above thirty-six thousand fighting men! and yet forty thousand
more French, under the Duc d'Harcourt are coming into
Flanders.  When their army is already so superior to ours, for
what can that reinforcement be intended, but to let them spare
a triumph to Dunkirk?  Now you will naturally ask me three
questions: where is Prince Charles?  where are the Dutch?
what force have you to defend England?  Prince Charles is
hovering about the Rhine to take Lorrain, which they seem not
to care whether he does or not, and leaves you to defend the
-Netherlands.  The Dutch seem indifferent, whether their
barrier is in the hands of the Queen or the Emperor and while
you are so mad, think it prudent not to be so themselves.  For
our own force, it is too melancholy to mention: six regiments
go away to-morrow to Ostend, with the six thousand Dutch.
Carteret and Botzlaer, the Dutch envoy extraordinary, would
have hurried them away without orders; but General Smitsart,
their commander, said, he was too old to be hanged.  This
reply was told to my father yesterday: "Ay," said he, "so I
thought I was, but I may live to be mistaken!"  When these
troops are gone, we shall not have in the whole island above
six thousand men, even when the regiments are complete; and
half of those pressed and new-listed men.  For our sea-force,
I wish it may be greater in proportion! Sir Charles Hardy,
whose name(934) at least is ill-favoured, is removed, and old
Balchen, a firm Whig, put at the head of the fleet.  Fifteen
ships are sent for from Matthews; but they may come as
opportunely as the army from Williamstadt-in short-but I won't
enter into reasonings-the King is not gone.  The Dutch have
sent word, that they can let us have but six of the twenty
ships we expected.  My father is going into Norfolk, quite
shocked at living to see how terribly his own conduct is
justified.  In the city the word is, "Old Sunderland'S(935)
game is acting over again."  Tell me if you receive this
letter: I believe you will scarce give it about in memorials.

Here are arrived two Florentines, not recommended to me, but I
have been very civil to them, Marquis Salviati and Conte
Delci; the latter remembers to have seen me at Madame
Grifoni's.  The Venetian ambassador met my father yesterday at
my Lady Brown's: you would have laughed to have seen how he
stared and @eccellenza'd him.  At last they fell into a broken
Latin chat, and there was no getting the ambassador away from
him.

If you have the least interest in any one Madonna in Florence,
pay her well for all the service she can do us.  If she can
work miracles, now is her time.  If she can't, I believe we
all shall be forced to adore her.  Adieu! Tell Mr. Chute I
fear we should not be quite so well received at the
conversazzioni, at Madame de Craon's, and the Casino,(936)
when we are but refugee heretics.  Well, we must hope! Yours I
am, and we will bear our wayward fate together.

(933) The 10th of June was the Pretender's birthday, and the 11th

373 Letter 140
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, June 18, 1744.
I have not any immediate bad news to tell you in consequence
of my last.  The siege of Ypres does not advance so
expeditiously as was expected; a little time gained in sieges
goes a great way in a campaign.  The Brest squadron is making
just as great a figure in our channel as Matthews does before
Toulon and Marseilles.  I should be glad to be told by some
nice computers of national glory, how much the balance is on
our side.

Anson(937) is returned with vast fortune, substantial and
lucky.  He has brought the Acapulca ship into Portsmouth, and
its treasure is at least computed at five hundred thousand
pounds.  He escaped the Brest squadron by a mist.  You will
have all the particulars in a gazette.

I will not fail to make your compliments to the Pomfrets and
Carterets.  I see them seldom, but I am in favour; so I
conclude, for my Lady Pomfret told me the other night, that I
said better things than any body.  I was with them all at a
subscription-ball at Ranelagh last week, which my Lady
Carteret thought proper to look upon as given to her, and
thanked the gentlemen, who were not quite so well pleased at
her condescending to take it to herself.  My lord stayed with
her there till four in the morning.  They are all fondness
-walk together, and stop every five steps to kiss.  Madame de
Craon is a cypher to her for grandeur.  The ball was on an
excessively hot night: yet she was dressed in a magnificent
brocade, because it was new that morning for the
inauguration-day.  I did the honours of all her dress:-"How
charming your ladyship's cross is!  I am sure the design was
your own."-"No, indeed; my lord sent it me just as it
is."-"How fine your ear-rings are!"-"Oh! but they are very
heavy." Then as much to the mother.  Do you wonder I say
better things than any body?

I send you by a ship going to Leghorn the only new books at
all worth reading.  The Abuse(938) of Parliaments is by
Doddington and Waller, circumstantially scurrilous.  The
dedication of the Essay(939) to my father is fine; pray mind
the quotation from Milton.  There is Dr. Berkeley's mad book
on tar-water, which has made every body as mad as himself.

I have lately made a great antique purchase of all Dr.
Middleton's collection which he brought from Italy, and which
he is now publishing.  I will send you the book as soon as it
comes out.  I would not buy the things till the book was half
printed, for fear of an `e Museo Walpoliano.-Those honours are
mighty well for such known and learned men as Mr. Smith,(940)
the merchant of Venice.  My dear Mr. Chute, how we used to
enjoy the title-page(941) of his understanding! Do you
remember how angry he was when showing us a Guido, after
pompous roomsfull of Sebastian Riccis, which he had a mind to
establish for capital pictures, you told him he had now made
amends for all the rubbish he had showed us before?

My father has asked, and with some difficulty got, his pension
of four thousand pounds a-year, which the King gave him on his
resignation and which he dropped, by the wise fears of my
uncle and the Selwyns.  He has no reason to be satisfied with
the manner of obtaining it now, or with the manner of the
man(942) whom he employed to ask it - yet it was not a point
that required capacity-merely gratitude.  Adieu!

(937) The celebrated circumnavigator, afterwards a peer, and
first lord of the admiralty.-D.

375 Letter 141

To The Hon.  H. S. Conway.(943)
Arlington Street, June 29, 1744.

My dearest Henry,
I don't know what made my last letter so long on the road:
yours got hither as soon as it could.  I don't attribute it to
any examination at the post-office.  God forbid I should
suspect any branch of the present administration of attempting
to know any one kind of thing!  I remember when I was at Eton,
and Mr. Bland(944) had set me an extraordinary task, I used
sometimes to pique myself upon not getting it, because it was
not immediately my school business.  What! learn more than I
was absolutely forced to learn! I felt the weight of learning
that; for I was a blockhead, and pushed up above my parts.

Lest you maliciously think I mean any application of this last
sentence any where in the world, I shall go and transcribe
some lines out of a new poem, that pretends to great
impartiality, but is evidently wrote by some secret friend of
the ministry.  It is called Pope's, but has no good lines but
the following.  The plan supposes him complaining of being put
to death by the blundering discord of his two physicians.
Burton and Thompson; and from thence makes a transition to
show that all the present misfortunes of the world flow from a
parallel disagreement; for instance, in politics:

"Ask you what cause this conduct can create?
The doctors differ that direct the state.
Craterus, wild as Thompson, rules and raves,
A slave himself yet proud of making slaves;
Fondly believing that his mighty parts
Can guide all councils and command all hearts;
Give shape and colour to discordant things,
Hide fraud in ministers and fear in kings.
Presuming on his power, such schemes he draws
For bribing Iron(945) and giving Europe laws,
That camps, and fleets, and treaties fill the news,
And succours unobtain'd and unaccomplish'd views.

"Like solemn Burton grave Plumbosus acts;
He thinks in method, argues all from facts;
Warm in his temper, yet affecting ice,
Protests his candour ere he gives advice;
Hints he dislikes the schemes he recommends,
And courts his foes-and hardly courts his friends;
Is fond of power, and yet concerned for fame-
>From different parties would dependents claim
Declares for war, but in an awkward way,
Loves peace at heart, which he's afraid to say;
His head perplex'd, altho' his hands are pure-
An honest man,-but not a hero sure!"

I beg you will never tell me any news till it has past every
impression of the Dutch gazette; for one is apt to mention
what is wrote to one: that gets about, comes at last to, the
ears of the ministry, puts them in a fright, and perhaps they
send to beg to see your letter.  Now, you know one should hate
to have one's private correspondence made grounds for a
measure,-especially for an absurd one, which is just possible.

If I was writing to any body but you, who know me so well, I
should be afraid this would be taken for pique and pride, and
be construed into my thinking all ministers inferior to my
father but, my dear Harry, you know it was never my foible to
think over-abundantly well of him.  Why I think as I do of the
great geniuses, answer for me, Admiral Matthews, great British
Neptune, bouncing in the Mediterranean, while the Brest
squadron is riding in the English Channel, and an invasion
from Dunkirk every moment threatening your coasts: against
which you send for six thousand Dutch troops, while you have
twenty thousand of your own in Flanders, which not being of
any use, you send these very six thousand Dutch to them, with
above half of the few of your own remaining in England; a
third part of which half of which few you countermand, because
you are again alarmed with the invasion, and yet let the six
Dutch go, who came for no other end but to protect you.  And
that our naval discretion may go hand-in-hand with our
military, we find we have no force at home; we send for
fifteen ships from the Mediterranean to guard our coasts, and
demand twenty from the Dutch.  The first fifteen will be here,
perhaps in three months.  Of the twenty Dutch, they excuse all
but six, of which six they send all but four; and your own
small domestic fleet, five are going to the West Indies and
twenty a hunting for some Spanish ships that are coming from
the Indies.  Don't it put you in mind of a trick that is done
by calculation: Think of a number: halve it-double it-and
ten-subtract twenty-add half the first number-take away all
you added: now, what remains?

That you may think I employ my time as idly as the great men I
have been talking of, you must be informed that every night
constantly I go to Ranelagh; which has totally beat Vauxhall.
Nobody goes any where else-every body goes there.  My Lord
Chesterfield is so fond of it, that he says he has ordered all
his letters to be directed thither.  If you had never seen it,
I would make you a most pompous description of it, and tell
you how the floor is all of beaten princes-you can't set your
foot without treading on a Prince of Wales or Duke of
Cumberland.  The company is universal: there is from his Grace
of Grafton down to Children out of the Foundling Hospital-
from my Lady Townshend to the kitten--from my Lord Sandys to
your humble cousin and sincere friend.

377 Letter 142
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, June 29, 1744.

Well, at last this is not to be the year of our captivity!
There is a cluster of good packets come at once.  The Dutch
have marched twelve thousand men to join our army; the King of
Sardinia (but this is only a report) has beaten the Spaniards
back over the Varo, and I this moment hear from the
Secretary's office, that Prince Charles has undoubtedly passed
the Rhine at the head of fourscore thousand men-where, and
with what circumstances, I don't know a word; ma basta cos`i.
It is said, too, that the Marquis de la Ch`etardie(946) is
sent away from Russia: but this one has no occasion to
believe.  False good news are always produced by true good,
like the waterfall by the rainbow.  But why do I take upon me
to tell you all this?-you, who are the centre of ministers and
business! the actuating genius in the conquest of Naples! You
cannot imagine how formidable you appear to me.  My poor
little, quiet Miny, with his headache and `epuisements, and
Cocchio, and coverlid of cygnet's down, that had no dealings
but with a little spy-abb`e at Rome, a civil whisper with
Count Lorenzi,(947) or an explanation on some of Goldsworthy's
absurdities, or with Richcourt about some sbirri,(948) that
had insolently passed through the street in which the King of
Great Britain's arms condescended to hang!  Bless me! how he
is changed, become a trafficking plenipotentiary with Prince
lobkowitz, Cardinal Albani(949) and Admiral Matthews! Why, my
dear child, I should not know you again; I should not dare to
roll you up between a finger and thumb like wet brown paper.
Well, heaven prosper your arms!  But I hate you, for I now
look upon you as ten times fatter than I am.

I don't think it would be quite unadvisable for Bistino(950)
to take a journey hither.  My Lady Carteret would take
violently to any thing that came so far as to adore her
grandeur.  I believe even my Lady Pomfret would be persuaded
he had seen the star of their glory travelling westward to
direct him.  For my part, I expect soon to make a figure too
in the political magazine, for all our Florence set is coming
to grandeur; but you and my Lady Carteret have outstripped me.
I remain with -the Duke of Courtland in Siberia-my father has
actually gone thither for a long season.  I met my Lady
Carteret the other day at Knaptons,(951) and desired leave to
stay while she sat for her picture.  She is drawn crowned with
corn, like the Goddess of Plenty, and a mild dove in her arms,
like Mrs. Venus.  We had much of my lord and my lord.  The
countess-mother was glad my lord was not there-he was never
satisfied with the eyes; she was afraid he would have had them
drawn bigger than the cheeks.  I made your compliments
abundantly, and cried down the charms of the picture as
politically as if' you yourself had been there in person.

To fill up this sheet, I shall transcribe some very good lines
published to-day in one of the papers, by I don't know whom,
on Pope's death.

"Here lies, who died, as most folks die, in hope,
The mouldering, more ignoble part of Pope;
The hard, whose sprightly genius dared to wage
Poetic war with an immoral age;
Made every vice and private folly known
In friend and foe--a stranger to his own
Set Virtue in its loveliest form to view,
And still professed to be the sketch he drew.
As humour or as interest served, his verse
Could praise or flatter, libel or asperse:
Unharming innocence with guilt could load,
Or lift the rebel patriot to a god:
Give the censorious critic standing laws-
The first to violate them with applause;
The just translator and the solid wit,
Like whom the passions few so truly hit:
The scourge of dunces whom his malice made-
The impious plague of the defenceless dead:
To real knaves and real fools a sore-
Beloved by many but abhorr'd by more,
If here his merits are not full exprest,
His never-dying strains shall tell the rest."

Sure the greater part was his true character; Here is another
epitaph by Rolli;(952) which for the profound fall in some of
the verses', especially in the last, will divert you.

"Spento `e il Pope: de' poeti Britanni
Uno de' lumi che sorge in mille anni:
Pur si vuol che la macchia d'Ingrato
N'abbia reso il fulgor men sereno:
Stato fora e pi`u giusto e pi`u grato.
Men lodando e biasmando ancor meno."

(946) French ambassador at the court of St. Petersburg, and
for some time a favourite of the Empress Elizabeth.  The
report of his disgrace was correct.  He died in 1758.-E.

(947) A Florentine, but employed as minister by France.

(948) The officers of justice, who are reckoned so infamous in
Italy, that the foreign ministers have always pretended to
hinder them from passing through the streets where they
reside.

(949) Cardinal Alexander Albani, nephew of Clement XI. was
minister of the Queen of Hungary at Rome.

(950) Giovanni Battista Uguecioni, a Florentine nobleman, and
great friend of the Pomfrets.


(951) George Knapton, a portrait painter.  Walpole says, he
was well versed in the theory of painting, and had a thorough
knowledge of the hands of the good masters.  He died at
Kensington, in 1778, at the age of eighty.-E.

and published several things.  [Thus hitched into the Dunciad-

"Rolli the feather to his ear conveys
Then his nice taste directs our operas."

Warburton says, "He taught Italian to some fine gentlemen, who
affected to direct the operas."



379 Letter 143
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Arlington Street, July 20, 1744.

My dearest Harry,
I feel that I have so much to say to you, that I foresee there
will be but little method in my letter; but if, upon the
whole, you see My meaning, and the depth of my friendship for
you, I am content.

It was most agreeable to me to receive a letter of confidence
from you, at the time I expected a very different one from
you; though, by the date of your last, I perceive you had not
then received some letters, which, though I did not see, I
must call simple, as they could only tend to make you uneasy
for some months.  I should not have thought of communicating a
quarrel to you at a distance, and I don't conceive the sort of
friendship of those that thought it necessary.  When I heard
it had been wrote to you, I thought it right to myself to give
you my account of it, but, by your brother's desire,
suppressed my letter, and left it to be explained by him, who
wrote to you so sensibly on it, that I shall say no more but
that I think myself so ill-used that it will prevent my giving
you thoroughly the advice you ask of me for how can I be sure
that my resentment might not make me see in a stronger light
the reasons for your breaking off an affair(953) which you
know before I never approved?

You know my temper is so open to any body I love that I must
be happy at seeing you lay aside a reserve with me, which is
the only point that ever made me dissatisfied with you.  That
silence of yours has, perhaps, been one of the chief reasons
that has always prevented my saying much to you on a topic
which I saw was so near your heart.  Indeed, its being so near
was another reason; for how could I expect you would take my
advice, even if you bore it? But, my dearest Harry, how can I
advise you now? Is it not gone too far -for me to expect you
should keep any resolution about it, especially in absence,
which must be destroyed the moment you meet again? And if ever
you should marry and be happy, won't you reproach me with
having tried to hinder it?  I think you as just and honest as
I think any man living; but any man living in that
circumstance would think I had been prompted by private
reasons.  I see as strongly as you can all the arguments for
your breaking off; but, indeed, the alteration of your fortune
adds very little strength to what they had before.  You never
had fortune enough to make such a step at all prudent: she
loved you enough to be content with that; I can't believe this
change will alter her sentiments, for I must do her the
justice to say that it is plain she preferred you with nothing
to all the world.  I could talk upon this head, but I will
only leave you to consider, without advising YOU On either
side, these two things-whether you think it honester to break
off with her after such engagements as yours (how strong I
don't know), after her refusing very good matches for you, and
show her that she must think of making her fortune; or whether
you will wait with her till some amendment in your fortune can
put it in your power to marry her.                    '


My dearest Harry, you must see why I don't care to say more on
this head.  My wishing it could be right for you to break off
with her (for, without it is right, I would not have you on
any account take such a step) makes it impossible for me to
advise it; and therefore, I am sure you will forgive my
declining, an act of friendship which your having put in my
power gives me the greatest satisfaction.  But it does put
something else in my power, which I am sure nothing can make
me decline, and for which I have long wanted an opportunity.
Nothing could prevent my being unhappy at the smallness of
your fortune, but its throwing it into my way to offer you to
share mine.  As mine is so precarious, by depending on so bad
a constitution, I can only offer you the immediate use of it.
I do that most sincerely.  My places still (though my Lord
Walpole has cut off three hundred pounds a-year to save
himself the trouble of signing his name ten times for once)
bring me in near two thousand pounds a-year.  I have no debts,
no connexions; indeed, no -way to dispose of it particularly.
By living with my father, I have little real use for a quarter
of it.  I have always flung it away all in the most idle
manner; but, my dear Harry, idle -,is I am, and thoughtless, I
have sense enough to have real pleasure in denying myself
baubles, and in saving a very good income to make a man happy,
for whom I have a just esteem and most sincere friendship.  I
know the difficulties any gentleman and man of spirit must
struggle with, even in having such an offer made him, much
more in accepting it.  I hope you will allow there are some in
making it.  But hear me: if there is such a thing as
friendship in the world, these are the opportunities of
exerting it, and it can't be exerted without it is accepted.
I must talk of myself to prove to you that it will be right
for 'you to accept it.  I am sensible of having more follies
and weaknesses, and fewer real good qualities than most men.
I sometimes reflect on this, though I own too seldom.  I
always want to begin acting like a man, and a sensible one,
which I think I might b, if I would.  Can I begin better, than
by taking care of my fortune for one I love?  You have seen (I
have seen you have) that I am fickle, and foolishly fond of
twenty new people; but I don't really love them-I have always
loved you constantly: I am willing to convince you and the
world, what I have always told you, that I loved you better
than any body.  If I ever felt much for any thing, which I
know may be questioned, it was certainly my mother.  I look on
you as my nearest relation by her, and I think I can never do
enough to show my gratitude and affection to her.  For these
reasons, don't deny me what I have set my heart on-the making
your fortune easy to you.

(953) This was an early attachment of Mr. Conway's.  By his
having complied with the wishes and advice of his friends on
this subject, and got the better of his passion, he probably
felt that he, in some measure, owed to Mr. Walpole the
subsequent happiness of his life, in his marriage with another
person.  (the lady alluded to was Lady Caroline Fitzroy,
afterwards Countess of Harrington, whose sister, Lady
Isabella, had, three years before, married Mr. Conway's elder
brother, afterwards Earl and Marquis of Hertford.]



381 Letter 144
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 22, 1744.

I have not written to you, my dear child, a good while, I know
but, indeed, it was from having nothing to tell you.  You know
I love you too well for it to be necessary to be punctually
proving it to you; so, when I have nothing worth your knowing,
I repose myself upon' the persuasion that you must have of my
friendship.  But I will never let that grow into any
negligence, I should say, idleness, which is always mighty
ready to argue me out of every thing I ought to do; and
letter-writing is one of the first duties that the very best
people let perish out of their rubric.  Indeed, I pride myself
extremely in having been so good a correspondent; for, besides
that every day grows to make one hate writing, more, it is
difficult, you must own, to keep up a correspondence of this
sort with any spirit, when long absence makes one entirely out
of all the little circumstances of each other's society, and
which are the soul of letters.  We are forced to deal only in
great events, like historians; and, instead of being Horace
Mann and Horace Walpole, seem to correspond as Guicciardin and
Clarendon would:

Discedo Alceus puncto Illius; ille meo quis!
Quis nisi Callimachus?

Apropos to writing histories and Guicciardin; I wish to God,
Boccalini was living! never was such an opportunity for
Apollo's playing off a set of looks, as there is now! The good
city of London, who, from long dictating to the government,
are now come to preside over taste and letters, have given one
Carte,(954) a Jacobite parson, fifty pounds a-year, for seven
years, to write the history of England; and four aldermen and
six common councilmen are to .inspect his materials and the
progress of the work.  Surveyors and common sewers turned
supervisors of literature! To be sure, they think a history of
England is no more than Stowe's Survey of the Parishes!
Instead of having books published with the imprimatur of an
university, they Will be printed, as churches are whitewashed,
John Smith and Thomas Johnson, churchwardens.

But, brother historian, you will wonder I should have nothing
to communicate, when all Europe is bursting with events, and
every day "big with the fate of Cato and of Rome."  But so it
is; I know nothing; Prince Charles's great passage of the
Rhine has hitherto produced nothing, more: indeed, the French
armies are moving towards him from Flanders; and they tell us,
ours is crossing the Scheldt to attack the Count de Saxe, now
that we arc equal to him, from our reinforcement and his
diminutions.  In the mean time, as I am at least one of the
principal heroes of my own politics, being secure of any
invasion, I am going to leave all my lares, that is, all my
antiquities, household gods and pagods, and take a journey
into Siberia for six weeks, where my father's grace of
Courland has been for some time.

Lord Middlesex is going to be married to Miss Boyle,(955) Lady
Shannon's daughter; she has thirty thousand pounds, and may
have as much more, if her mother, who is a plain widow, don't
happen to Nugentize.(956)  The girl is low and ugly, but a
vast scholar.

Young Churchill has got a daughter by the Frasi;(957) Mr.
Winnington calls it the opera-comique ; the mother is an opera
girl; the grandmother was Mrs.  Oldfield.

I must tell you of a very extraordinary print, which my Lady
Burlington gives away, of her daughter Euston, -with this
inscription:

Lady Dorothy Boyle,
Once the pride, the joy, the -comfort of her parents,
The admiration of all that saw her,
The delight of all that knew her.
Born May 14, 1724, married alas! Oct. 10, 1741, an
delivered from extremest misery May 2, 1742.

This print was taken from a picture drawn by memory seven
weeks after her death, by her most afflicted mother;
DOROTHY BURLINGTON.(958)

I am forced to begin a new sheet, lest you should think my
letter came from my Lady Burlington, as it ends so patly with
her name.  But is it not a most melancholy way of venting
oneself? She has drawn numbers of these pictures: I don't
approve her having them engraved; but sure the
inscription(959) is pretty.

I was accosted the other night by 'a little, pert petit-maitre
figure, that claimed me for acquaintance.  Do you remember to
have seen at Florence an Abb`e Durazzo, of Genoa? well, this
was he: it is mighty dapper and French: however, I will be
civil to it: I never lose opportunities of paving myself an
agreeable passage back to Florence.  My dear Chutes, stay for
me: I think the first gale of peace will carry me to you.  Are
you as fond of Florence as ever? of me you are not, I am sure,
for you never write me a line.  You would be diverted with the
grandeur of our old Florence beauty, Lady Carteret.  She
dresses more extravagantly, and grows more short-sighted every
day: she can't walk a step without leaning on one of her
ancient daughters-in law.  Lord Tweedale and Lord Bathurst are
her constant gentlemen-ushers.  She has not quite digested her
resentment to Lincoln yet.  He was walking with her at
Ranelagh the other night, and a Spanish refugee marquis,(960)
who is of the Carteret court, but who, not being quite perfect
in the carte du pais, told my lady, that Lord Lincoln had
promised him to make a very good husband to Miss Pelham.  Lady
Carteret, with an accent of energy, replied, "J'esp`ere qu'il
tiendra sa promesse!" Here is a good epigram that has been
made on her:

"Her beauty, like the Scripture feast,
To which the invited never came,
Deprived of its intended guest,
Was given to the old and lame."

Adieu! here is company; I think I may be excused leaving off
at the sixth side.

(954) Thomas Carte, a laborious writer of history.  His
principal works are, his Life of the Duke of Ormonde, in three
volumes, folio, and his History of England, in four.  He
                        died in 1754.-D. [The former, though
ill-written, was considered by Dr. Johnson as a work of
authority; and of the latter Dr. Warton remarks, "You may read
Hume for his  eloquence, but Carte is the historian for
facts."]

(955) Grace Boyle, daughter and sole heiress of Richard,
Viscount Shannon.  She became afterwards a favourite of
Frederick, Prince of Wales, and died in 17 63.-D.

(956) See ant`e, p. 205.  (Letter 48)

(957 Prima donna at the opera.

(958) This is an incorrect copy of the inscription on Lady
Euston's picture given in a note at 329 of this volume.-D.
(Letter 110, p. 328/9)

(959) It is said to be Pope's.

(960) The Marquis Tabernego.



383 Letter 145
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Aug. 6, 1744.

I don't tell you any thing about Prince Charles, for you must
hear all his history as soon as we do: at least much sooner
than it can come to the very north, and be despatched back to
Italy.  There is nothing from Flanders: we advance and they
retire-just as two months ago we retired and they advanced:
but it is good to be leading up this part of the tune.  Lord
Stair is going into Scotland: the King is grown wonderfully
fond of him, since he has taken the resolution of that
journey.  He said the other day, "I wish my Lord Stair was in
Flanders! General Wade is a very able officer, but he is not
alert."  I, in my private litany, am beseeching the Lord, that
he may contract none of my Lord Stair's alertness.

When I first wrote you word of la Ch`etardie's disgrace, I did
not believe it; but you see it is now public.  What I like is,
her Russian Majesty's making her amour keep exact pace with
her public indignation.  She sent to demand her picture and
other presents. "Other presents," to be sure, were
billet-doux, bracelets woven of her own bristles-for I look
upon the hair of a Muscovite Majesty in the light of the
chairs which Gulliver made out of the combings of the Empress
of Brobdignag's tresses: the stumps he made into very good
large-tooth combs.  You know the present is a very Amazon. she
has grappled with all her own grenadiers.  I should like to
see their loves woven into a French opera: La Ch`etardie's
character is quite adapted to the civil discord of their
stage: and then a northern heroine to reproach him in their
outrageous quavers, would make a most delightful crash of
sentiment, impertinence, gallantry, contempt, and screaming.
The first opera that I saw at Paris, I could not believe was
in earnest, but thought they had carried me to the
op`era-comique.  The three acts of the piece(961) were three
several interludes, of the Loves of Antony and Cleopatra, of
Alcibiades and the Queen of Sparta, and of Tibuilus with a
niece of Macenas; besides something of Circe, who was screamed
by a Mademoiselle Hermans, seven feet high.  She was in
black, with a nosegay of black (for on the French stage they
pique themselves on propriety,) and without powder: whenever
you are a widow, are in distress, or are a witch, you are to
leave off powder.

I have no news for you, and am going to have less, for I a)n
going into Norfolk.  I have stayed till I have not one
acquaintance left: the next billow washes me last off the
plank.  I have not cared to stir, for fear of news from
Flanders; but I have convinced myself that there will be
none.  Our army is much superior to the Count de Saxe;
besides, they have ten large towns to garrison, which will
reduce their army to nothing; or they must leave us the towns
to walk into coolly.

I have received yours of July 21.  Did neither I nor your
brother tell you, that we had received the Neapolitan
snuff-box?(962)  it is above a month ago: how could I be so
forgetful? but I have never heard one word of the cases, nor
of Lord Conway's guns, nor Lord Hartington's melon-seeds, all
which you mention to have sent.  Lestock has long been
arrived, so to be sure the cases never came with him: I hope
Matthews will discover them.  Pray thank Dr. Cocchi very
particularly for his book.

I am very sorry too for your father's removal; it was not done
in the most obliging manner by Mr. Winnington; there was
something exactly like a breach of promise in it to my father,
which was tried to be softened by a civil alternative, that
was no alternative at all.  He was forced to it by my Lady
Townshend, who has an implacable aversion to all my father's
people; and not having less to Mr. Pelham's, she has been as
brusque with Winnington about them.  He has no principles
himself, and those no principles of his are governed
absolutely by hers, which are no-issimes.

I don't know any of your English.  I should delight in your
Vauxhall-ets: what a figure my Grifona must make in such a
romantic scene!  I have lately been reading the poems of the
Earl of Surrey,(963) in Henry the Eighth's time; he was in
love with the fair Geraldine of Florence; I have a mind to
write under the Grifona's picture these two lines from one of
his sonnets:

"From Tuscane came my lady's worthy race,
Fair Florence was some time her auncient seat."

And then these:

"Her beauty of kinde, her vertue from above;
Happy is he that can obtaine her love!"


I don't know what of kinde means, but to be sure it was
something prodigiously expressive and gallant in those days,
by its being unintelligible now.  Adieu! Do the Chutes
cicisb`e it?

(961) I think it was the ballet de la paix.

(962) It was for a present to Mr. Stone, the Duke of
Newcastle's secretary

(963) Henry Howard, son of the Duke of Norfolk.  Under a
charge of high-treason, of which he was manifestly innocent,
this noble soldier and accomplished poet was found guilty, and
in 1547, in his thirty-first year, was beheaded on Tower Hill.
History is silent as to the name of fair Geraldine.-E.



385 Letter 146
To Sir Horace Mann.
London, Aug. 16, 1744.

I am writing to you two or three days beforehand, by way of
settling my affairs-not that I am going to be married or to
die; but something as bad as either if it were to last as
long.  You will guess that it can only be going to Houghton;
but I make as much an affair of that, as other people would of
going to Jamaica.  Indeed I don't lay in store of cake and
bandboxes, and citron-water, and cards, and cold meat, as
country-women do after the session.  My packing-up and
travelling concerns lie in very small compass; nothing but
myself and Patapan, my footman, a cloak-bag, and a couple of
books.  My old Tom is even reduced upon the article of my
journey; he is at the Bath, patching together some very bad
remains of a worn-out constitution.  I always travel without
company; for then I take my own hours and my own humours,
which I don't think the most tractable to shut up in a coach
with any body else.  You know, St. Evremont's rule for
conquering the passions, was to indulge them mine for keeping
my temper in order, is never to leave it too long with another
person.  I have found out that it will have its way, but I
make it take its way by itself.  It is such sort of reflection
as this, that makes me hate the country: it is impossible in
one house with one set of company, to be always enough upon
one's guard to make one's self agreeable, which one ought to
do, as one always expects it from others.  If I had a house of
my own in the country, and could live there now and then
alone, or frequently changing my company, I am persuaded I
should like it; at least, I fancy I should; for when one
begins to reflect why one don't like the country, I believe
one grows near liking to reflect in it.  I feel very often
that I grow to correct twenty things in myself, as thinking
them ridiculous at my age; and then with my spirit of whim and
folly, I make myself believe that this is all prudence, and
that I wish I were young enough to be as thoughtless and
extravagant as I used to be. But if I know any thing of the
matter, this is all flattering myself. I grow older, and love
my follies less-if I did not, alas! poor prudence and
reflection!

I think I have pretty well exhausted the chapter of myself.  I
will now go talk to YOU Of another fellow, who makes me look
upon myself as a very perfect character; for as I have little
merit naturally, and only pound a stray virtue now @ind then
by chance, the other gentleman seems to have no vice, rather
no villainy, but what he nurses in himself and metliodizes
with as much pains as a stoic would patience.  Indeed his
pains are not thrown away.  This painstaking person's name is
Frederic, King of Prussia.  Pray remember for the future never
to speak of him and H. W. without giving the latter the
preference.  Last week we were all alarm!  He was before
Prague with fifty thousand men, and not a man in Bohemia to
ask him, "What dost thou?"  This week we have raised a hundred
thousand Hungarians, besides vast militias and loyal
nobilities.  The King of Poland is to attack him on his march,
and the Russians to fall on Prussia.(964)  In the mean time,
his letter or address to the people of England(965) has been
published here: it is a poor performance!  His Voltaires and
his litterati should correct his works before they are
printed.  A careless song, with a little nonsense in it now
and then, does not misbecome a monarch; but to pen manifestoes
worse than the lowest commis that is kept jointly by two or
three margraves, is insufferable!

We are very strong in Flanders, but still expect to do nothing
this campaign.  The French are so entrenched, that it is
impossible to attack them.  There is talk of besieging
Maubeuge; I don't know how certainly.

Lord Middlesex's match is determined, and the writings signed.
She proves an immense fortune; they pretend a hundred and
thirty thousand pounds-what a fund for making operas!

My Lady Carteret is going to Tunbridge--there is a hurry for a
son: his only one is gone mad: about a fortnight ago he was at
the Duke of Bedford's, and as much in his few senses as ever.
At five o'clock in the morning he waked the duke and duchess
all bloody, and with the lappet of his coat held up full of
ears: he had been in the stable and cropped all the horses! He
is shut up.(966)  My lady is in the honeymoon of her grandeur:
she lives in public places, whither she is escorted by the old
beaux of her husband's court; fair white-wigged old gallants,
the Duke of Bolton,(967) Lord Tweedale, Lord Bathurst, and
Charles Fielding;(968) and she all over knots, and small
hoods, and ribands.  Her brother told me the other night,
"Indeed I think my thister doesth countenanth Ranelagh too
mutch."  They call Lord Pomfret, King Stanislaus, the queen's
father.

I heard an admirable dialogue, which has been written at the
army on the battle of Dettingen, but one can't get a copy; I
must tell you two or three strokes in it that I have heard.
Pierot asks Harlequin, "Que donne-t'on aux g`en`eraux qui ne
se sont pas trouv`es `a la bataille!"  Harl. "On leur donne le
cordon rouge."  Pier. "Et que donne-t'on au g`en`eral en
Chef(969 qui a gagn`e la victoire!"  Harl. "Son cong`e."
Pier. "Qui a soin des bless`es?"  Harl. "L'ennemi."  Adieu!

(964) This alludes to the King of Prussia's retreat from
Prague, on the approach of the Austrian army commanded by
Prince Charles Lorraine.-D.

(965) In speaking of this address of the King of Prussia, Lady
Hervey, in a letter of the 17th, says, "I think it very well
and very artfully drawn for his purpose, and very
impertinently embarrassing to our King.  He is certainly a
very artful prince, and I cannot but think his projects and
his ambition still more extensive, than people at present
imagine them."-E.

(66) On the death of his father this son succeeded to the
earldom in 1763.  He died in 1776, when the title became
extinct.-E.

(967) Charles Poulett, third Duke of Bolton.

(968) The Hon, Charles Fielding, third son of William, third
Earl of Denbigh; a lieutenant-colonel in the guards, and
Gentleman-usher to Queen Caroline.  He died in 1765.-E.

(969) Lord Stair.-D.



387 Letter 147
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, Sept. 1, 1744.

I wish you joy of your victory at Velletri!(970)  I call it
yours, for you are the great spring of all that war.  I intend
to publish your life, with an Appendix, that shall contain all
the letters to you from princes, cardinals, and great men of
the time.  In speaking of Prince Lobkowitz's attempt to seize
the King of Naples at Velletri, I shall say: "for the share
our hero had in this great action, vide the Appendix, Card.
Albani's letter, p. 14."  You shall no longer be the dear
Miny, but Manone, the Great Man; you shall figure with the
Great Pan, and the Great Patapan.  I wish you and your laurels
and your operations were on the Rhine, in Piedmont, or in
Bohemia; and then Prince Charles would not have repassed the
first, nor the Prince of Conti advanced within three days of
Turin, and the King of Prussia would already have been
terrified from entering the last-all this lumping bad news
came to counterbalance your Neapolitan triumphs.  Here is all
the war to begin again! and perhaps next winter a second
edition of Dunkirk.  We could not even have the King of France
die, though he was so near it.  He was in a woful fright, and
promised the Bishop of Soissons, that if he lived, he would
have done with his women.(971)  A man with all these crowns on
his head, and attaching and disturbing all those on the heads
of other princes, who is the soul of all the havoc and ruin
that has been and is to be spread through Europe in this war,
haggling thus for his bloody life, and cheapening it at the
price of a mistress or two! and this was the fellow that they
fetched to the army to drive the brave Prince Charles beyond
the Rhine again.  It is just Such another paltry mortal(972)
that has fetched him back into Bohemia-I forget which of his
battles(973) it was, that when his army had got the victory,
they could not find the King: he had run away for a whole day
without looking behind him.

I thank you for the particulars of the action, and the list of
the prisoners: among them is one Don Theodore Diamato Amor, a
cavalier of so romantic a name, that my sister and Miss Leneve
quite interest themselves in his captivity; and make their
addresses to you, who, they hear, have such power with Prince
Lobkowitz, to obtain his liberty.  If he has Spanish gallantry
in any proportion to his name, he will immediately come to
England, and vow himself their knight.

Those verses I sent you on Mr. Pope, I assure you, were not
mine; I transcribed them from the newspapers; from whence I
must send you a very good epigram on Bishop Berkeley's
tar-water:

"Who dare deride what pious Cloyne has done?
The Church shall rise and vindicate her son;
She tells us, all her Bishops shepherds are-
And shepherds heal their rotten sheep with tar."

I am not at all surprised at my Lady Walpole's ill-humour to
you about the messenger.  If the resentments of women did not
draw them into little dirty spite, their hatred would be very
dangerous; but they vent the leisure they have to do mischief
in a thousand meannesses, which only serve to expose
themselves.

Adieu! I know nothing here but public politics, of which I
have already talked to you, and which you hear as soon as I
do.

Thank dear Mr. Chute for his letter; I will answer it very
soon; but in the country I am forced to let my pen lie fallow
between letter and letter.


(970) The Austrians had formed a scheme to surprise the
Neapolitan King and general at Velletri, and their first
column penetrated into the place, but reinforcements coming
up, they were repulsed with considerable slaughter.-E.

(971) On the 8th of August, Louis the Fifteenth was seized at
Metz, on his march to Alsace, with a malignant putrid fever,
which increased so rapidly, that, in a few days, his life was
despaired of.  In his illness, he dismissed his reigning
mistress, Madame de Chateauroux.-E.

388 Letter 148
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
 Houghton, Oct. 6, 1744.

My dearest Harry,
My lord bids me tell you how much he is obliged to you for
your letter, and hopes you will accept my answer for his.
I'll tell you what, we shall both be obliged to you if you
will inclose a magnifying-glass in your next letters; for your
two last were in so diminutive a character, that we were
forced to employ all Mrs. Leneve's spectacles, besides an
ancient family reading-glass, with which my grandfather used
to begin the psalm, to discover what you said to us.  Besides
this, I have a piece of news for you: Sir Robert Walpole, when
he was made Earl of Orford, left the ministry, and with it the
palace in Downing-street; as numbers of people found out three
years ago, who, not having your integrity, were quick in
perceiving the change of his situation.  Your letter was full
as honest as you; for, though directed to Downing-street, it
would not, as other letters would have done, address itself to
the present possessor.  Do but think if it had!  The smallness
of the hand would have immediately struck my Lord Sandys with
the idea of a plot; for what he could not read' at first
sight, he would certainly have concluded must be cipher.

I march next week towards London, and have already begun to
send my heavy artillery before me, consisting of half-a-dozen
books and part of my linen: my light-horse, commanded by
Patapan, follows this day se'nnight.  A detachment of hussars
surprised an old bitch fox yesterday morning, who had lost a
leg in a former engagement; and then, having received advice
of another litter being advanced as far as Darsingham, Lord
Walpole commanded Captain Riley's horse, with a strong party
of foxhounds, to overtake them; but on the approach of our
troops the enemy stole off, and are now encamped at Sechford
common, whither we every hour expect orders to pursue them.

My dear Harry, this is all I have to tell you, and, to my
great joy, which you must forgive me, is full as memorable as
any part of the Flanders campaign.  I do not desire to have
you engaged in the least more glory than you have been.  I
should not love the remainder of you the least better for your
having lost an arm or a leg, and have as full persuasion of
your courage as if you had contributed to the slicing off
twenty pair from French officers.  Thank God. you have sense
enough to content yourself without being a hero! though I
don't quite forget your expedition a hussar-hunting the
beginning of this campaign.  Pray, no more of those jaunts.  I
don't know any body you would oblige with a present of such
game - for my part, a fragment of the oldest hussar on earth
should never have a place in my museum-they are not antique
enough; and for a live one, I must tell you, I like my raccoon
infinitely better.

Adieu! my dear Harry.  I long to see you, You will easily
believe the thought I have of being particularly well with you
is a vast addition to my impatience, though you know it is
nothing new to me to be overjoyed at your return.  Yours ever.



390 Letter 149
To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, Oct. 6, 1744.

Does decency insist upon one's writing within certain periods,
when one has nothing to say? because, if she does, she is the
most formal, ceremonious personage I know.  I shall not enter
into a dispute with her, as my Lady Hervey did with the
goddess of Indolence, or with the goddess of letter-writing, I
forget which, in a long letter that she sent to the Duke of
Bourbon; because I had rather write than have a dispute about
it.  Besides, I am not at all used to converse with
hierglyphic ladies.  But, I do assure you, it is merely to
avoid scolding that I set about this letter: I don't mean your
scolding, for you are all goodness to me; but my own scolding
of myself-a correction I stand in great awe of, and which I am
sure never to escape as often as I am to blame.  One can scold
other people again, or smile and jog one's foot, and affect
not to mind it; but those airs won't do with oneself; One
always comes by the worst in a dispute with one's own
conviction.

Admiral Matthews sent me down hither your great packet: I am
charmed with your prudence, and with the good sense of your
orders for the Neapolitan expedition; I won't say your good
nature, which is excessive for I think your tenderness of the
little Queen(974) a little outree, especially as their
apprehensions might have added great weight to your menaces.
I would threaten like a corsair, though I would conquer with
all the good-breeding of a Scipio.  I most devoutly wish you
success; you are sure of having me most happy with any honour
you acquire.  You have quite soared above all fear of
Goldsworthy, and, I think, must appear of consequence to any
ministry.  I am much obliged to you for the medal, and like
the design: I shall preserve it as part of your works.

I can't forgive what you say to me about the coffee-pot: one
would really think that you looked upon me as an old woman
that had left a legacy to be kept for her sake, and a curse to
attend the parting with it.  My dear child, is it treating me
justly to enter into the detail of your reasons? was it even
necessary to say, ,I have changed your coffee-pot for some
other plate?"

I have nothing to tell you but that I go to town next week,
and will then write you all I hear.  Adieu!

(974) The Queen of Naples,-Maria of Saxony, wife of Charles
the Third, King of Naples, and subsequently, on the death of
his elder brother, King of Spain.  This alludes to the

391 Letter 150
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Oct 19, 1744.

I have received two or three letters from you since I wrote to
you last, and all contribute to give me fears for your
situation at Florence.  How absurdly all the Queen's ban
haughtinesses are dictated to her by her ministers, or by her
own Austriacity!  She lost all Silesia because she would not
lose a small piece of it, and she is going to lose Tuscany for
want of a neutrality, because she would not accept one for
Naples, even after all prospect of conquering it was vanished.
Every thing goes ill! the King of Sardinia beaten; and to-day
we hear of Coni lost! You will see in the papers too, that the
Victory, our finest ship, is lost, with Sir John Balchen and
nine hundred men.(975)  The expense alone of the ship is
computed at above two hundred thousand pounds.  We have
nothing good but a flying report of a victory of Prince
Charles over the Prussian, who, it 'Is said, has lost ten
thousand men, and both his legs by a cannon-ball.  I have no
notion of his losing them, but by breaking them in over-hurry
to run away.  However, it comes from a Jew, who had the first
news of the passage of the Rhine.(976)  But, my dear child,
how will this comfort me, if you are not to remain in peace at
Florence! I tremble as I write!

Yesterday morning carried off those two old beldamss, Sarah of
Marlborough and the (.countess Granville;(977) so now
Uguccioni's(978) epithalamium must be new-tricked out in
titles, for my Lady Carteret is Countess! Poor Bistino! I wish
my Lady Pomfret may leave off her translation of Froissart to
English the eight hundred and forty heroics! When I know the
particulars of old Marlborough's will, you shall.

My Lord Walpole has promised me a letter for young Gardiner;
who, by the way, has pushed his fortune en vrai b`atard,
without being so, for it never was pretended that he was my
brother's - he protests he is not; but the youth has profited
of his mother's gallantries.

I have not seen Admiral Matthews yet, but I take him to be
very mad. He walks in the Park with a cockade of three
/colours: the Duke desired a gentleman to ask him the meaning,
and all the answer he would give was, "The Treaty of Worms!
the treaty of Worms!"  I design to see him, thank him for my
packet, and inquire after the cases.

it is a most terrible loss for his parents, Lord
Beauchamp's(979) death: if they were out of the question, one
could not be sorry for such a mortification to the pride of
old Somerset.  He has written the most shocking letter
imaginable to poor Lord Hertford, telling him that it is a
judgment upon him for all his undutifulness, and that he must
always look upon himself. as the cause of' his son's death.
Lord Hertford is as good a man as lives, and has always been
most unreasonably ill-used by that old tyrant.  The title of'
Somerset will revert to Sir Edward Seymour, whose line has
been most unjustly deprived of it from the first creation.
  The Protector when only Earl of Hertford, married a great
heiress, and had a Lord Beauchamp, who was about twenty when
his mother died.  His father then married an Anne Stanhope,
with whom he was In love, and not only procured an act of
parliament to deprive Lord Beauchamp of' his honours and to
settle the title of Somerset, which he was going to have, on
the children of' this second match, but took from him even his
mother's fortune.  From him descended Sir Edward Seymour, the
Speaker, who, on King William's landing, when he said to him,
"Sir Edward, I think you are of the Duke of Somerset's
family!" replied, "No, Sir: he is of mine."

Lord Lincoln was married last Tuesday, and Lord Middlesex will
be very soon.  Have you heard the gentle manner of the French
King's dismissing Madame de Chateauroux? In the very circle,
the Bishop of Soissons(980) told her, that, as the scandal the
King had given with her was public, his Majesty thought his
repentance ought to be so too, and that he therefore forbade
her the court; and then turning to the monarch, asked him if
that was not his pleasure, who replied, Yes.  They have taken
away her pension too, and turned out even laundresses that she
had recommended for the future Dauphiness.  A-propos to the
Chateauroux: there is a Hanoverian come over, who was so
ingenuous as to tell Master Louis,(981) how like he is to M.
Walmoden.  You conceive that "nous autres souvereins nous
n'aimons pas qu'on se m`eprenne aux gens:" we don't love that
our Fitzroys should be scandalized with any mortal
resemblance.

I must tell you a good piece of discretion of a Scotch
soldier, whom Mr. Selwyn met on Bexley Heath walking back to
the army.  He had met with a single glove at Higham, which had
been left there last year in an inn by an officer now in
Flanders: this the fellow was carrying in hopes of a little
money; but, for fear he should lose the glove, wore it all the
way.

Thank you for General Braitwitz's deux potences.(982)  I hope
that one of them, at least will rid us of the Prussian.
Adieu! my dear child: all my wishes are employed about
Florence.

(975) The Victory, of a hundred and ten brass guns, was lost,
between the 4th and 5th of October, near Alderney.-E.

(976) This report proved to be without foundation.

(977) Mother of John, Lord Carteret, who succeeded her in the
title.

(978) A Florentine, who had employed an abbe of his
acquaintance to write an epithalamium on Lord Carteret's
marriage, consisting of eight hundred and forty Latin lines.
Sir H. Mann had given an account of the composition of this
piece of literary flattery in one of his letters to
Walpole.-D.

(979) Only son of Algernon, Earl of Hertford, afterwards the
last Duke of Somerset of that branch. [lord Beauchamp was
seized with the smallpox at Bologna, and, after an illness of
four days, died on the 11th of September; on which day he had
completed his nineteenth year.]

(980) Son of Fitzjames, Duke of Berwick.  This Bishop of
Soissons, on the King being given over at Metz, prevailed on
him to part with his mistress, the Duchess de Chateauroux; but
the King soon recalled her, and confined the bishop to his
diocese.

(981) Son of King George II. by Madame Walmoden, created
Countess of Yarmouth.

(982) General Braitwitz, commander of the Queen of Hungary's

393 Letter 151
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 9, 1744.

I find I must not wait any longer for news, if I intend to
keep up our correspondence.  Nothing happens; nothing has
since I wrote last, but Lord Middlesex's wedding;(983) which
was over above a week before it was known.  I believe the
bride told it then; for he and all his family are so silent,
that they Would never have mentioned it: she might have popped
out a child, before a single Sackville would have been at the
expense of a syllable to justify her.

Our old acquaintance, the Pomfrets, are not so reserved about
their great matrimony: the new Lady Granville was at home the
other night for the first time of her being mistress of the
house.  I was invited, for I am in much favour with them all,
but found myself extremely d`eplac`e: there was nothing but
the Winchilseas and Baths, and the Gleanings of a party
stuffed out into a faction, some foreign ministers, and the
whole blood of Fermor.  My Lady Pomfret asked me if I
corresponded still with the Grifona: "No," I said, "since I
had been threatened with a regale of hams and Florence wine, I
had dropped it."  My Lady Granville said, "You was afraid of
being thought interested."--"Yes," said the queen-mother, with
all the importance with which she used to blunder out pieces
of heathen mythology, "I think it was very ministerial."
Don't you think that the Minister word came in as awkwardly as
I did into their room?  The Minister is most gracious to me;
he has returned my visit, which, you know, IS never practised
by that rank: I put it all down to my father's account, who is
not likely to keep up the civility.

You will see the particulars of old Marlborough's will in the
Evening Posts of this week: it is as extravagant as one should
have expected; but I delight in her begging that no part of
the Duke of Marlborough's life may be written in verse by
Glover and Mallet, to whom she gives five hundred pounds
apiece for writing it in prose.(984)  There is a great deal of
humour in the thought: to be sure the spirit of the dowager
Leonidas(985) inspired her with it.

All public affairs in agitation at present go well for us;
Prince Charles in Bohemia, the raising of the siege of Coni,
and probably of that of Fribourg, are very good circumstances.
I shall be very tranquil this winter, if Tuscany does not come
into play, or another scene of invasion.  In a fortnight meets
the Parliament; nobody guesses what the turn of the Opposition
will be.  Adieu! My love to the Chutes.  I hope you now and
then make my other compliments: I never forget the Princess,
nor (ware hams!) the Grifona.

(983) The Earl of Middlesex married Grace, daughter and sole
heiress of Lord Shannon.  On the death of his father in 1765,
he succeeded, as second Duke of Dorset, and died without
issue, in 1769.-E.

(984) Glover, though in embarrassed circumstances at the time,
renounced the legacy; Mallet accepted it, but never fulfilled
the terms.-E.

(985) Glover wrote a dull heroic poem on the action of
Leonidas at Thermopylae.  ["Though far indeed from being a
vivid or arresting picture of antiquity, Leonidas," says Mr.
Campbell, "the local descriptions of Leonidas, its pure
sentiments, and the classical images which it recalls, render
it interesting, as the monument of an accomplished and amiable
mind."]



394 Letter 152
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 26, 1744.

I have not prepared for you a great event, because it was
really,
 so unlikely to happen, that I was afraid of being the author
of a mere political report; but, to keep you no longer in
suspense, Lord Granville has resigned: that is the term
"l'honn`ete fa`con de parler;" but, in few words, the truth of
the history is, that the Duke of Newcastle (by the way, mind
that the words I am going to use are not mine, but his
Majesty's,) "being grown as jealous of Lord Granville(986) as
he had been of Lord Orford, and wanting to be first minister
himself, which, a puppy! how should he be?"  (autre phrase
royale) and his brother being as susceptible of the noble
passion of jealousy as he is, have long been conspiring to
overturn the great lord.  Resolution and capacity were all
they wanted to bring it about; for the imperiousness and
universal contempt which their rival had for them, and for the
rest of the ministry, and for the rest of the nation, had made
almost all men his engines; and, indeed, he took no pains to
make friends: his maxim was, "Give any man the Crown on his
side, and he can defy every thing."  Winnington asked him, if
that were true, how he came to be minister? About a fortnight
ago, the whole cabinet-council, except Lord Bath, Lord
Winchilsea, Lord Tweedale, the Duke of Bolton, and my good
brother-in-law,(987) (the two last severally bribed with the
promise of Ireland,) did venture to let the King know, that he
must part with them or with Lord Granville.  The monarch does
not love to be forced, and his son is full as angry.  Both
tried to avoid the rupture.  My father was sent for, but
excused himself from coming till last Thursday, and even then
would not ,go to the King; and at last gave his opinion very
unwillingly.  But on Saturday it was finally determined: Lord
Granville resigned the seals, which are given back to my Lord
President Harrington.  Lord Winchilsea quits too; but for all
the rest of that connexion, they have agreed not to quit, but
to be forced out: so Mr. Pelham must have a new struggle to
remove every one.  He can't let them stay in; because, to
secure his power, he must bring in Lord Chesterfield, Pitt,
the chief patriots, and perhaps some Tories. The King has
declared that my Lord Granville has his opinion and
affection-the Prince warmly and openly espouses him.  Judge
how agreeably the two brothers will enjoy their ministry!
To-morrow the Parliament meets: all in suspense! every body
will be staring at each other! I believe the war will still go
on, but a little more Anglicized.  For my part, I behold all
with great tranquillity; I cannot --be sorry for Lord
Granville,-for he certainly sacrificed everything to please
the King; I cannot be glad for the Pelhams, for they sacrifice
every thing to their own jealousy and ambition.

Who are mortified, are the fair Sophia and Queen Stanislaus.
However, the daughter carries it off heroically: the very
night of her fall she went to the Oratorio.  I talked to her
much, and recollected all that had been said to me upon the
like occasion three years ago: I succeeded, and am invited to
her assembly next Tuesday.  Tell Uguccioni that she still
keeps conversazioni, or he will hang himself.  She had no
court, but an ugly sister and the fair old-fashioned Duke of
Bolton.  It put me in mind of a scene in Harry VIII., where
Queen Catherine appears after her divorce, with Patience her
waiting-maid, and Griffith her gentleman-usher.

My dear child, voil`a le monde! are you as great a philosopher
about it as I am? You cannot imagine how I entertain myself,
especially as all the ignorant flock hither, and conclude that
my lord must be minister again.  Yesterday, three bishops came
to do him homage; and who should be one of them but Dr.
Thomas.(988) the only man mitred by Lord Granville! As I was
not at all mortified with our fall, I am only diverted with
this imaginary restoration.  They little think how incapable
my lord is of business again.  He has this whole summer been
troubled with bloody water upon the least motion; and to-day
Ranby assured me, that he has a stone in his bladder, which he
himself believed before: so now he must never use the least
exercise, never go into a chariot again; and if ever to
Houghton, in a litter.  Though this account will grieve you, I
tell it you, that you may know what to expect; yet it is
common for people to live many years in his situation.

if you are not as detached from every thing as I am, you will
wonder at my tranquillity, to be able to write such variety in
the midst of hurricanes.  It costs me nothing; so I shall
write on, and tell you an adventure of my own.  The town has
been trying all this winter to beat pantomimes off the stage,
very boisterously; for it is the way here to make even an
affair of taste and sense a matter of riot and arms.
Fleetwood, the master of Drury-Lane, has omitted nothing to
support them, as they supported his house.  About ten days
ago, he let into the pit great numbers of Bear-garden bruisers
(that is the term), to knock down every body that hissed.  The
pit rallied their forces, and drove them out: I was sitting
very quietly in the side-boxes, contemplating all this.  On a
sudden the curtain flew up, and discovered the whole stage
filled with blackguards, armed with bludgeons and clubs, to
menace the audience.  This raised the greatest uproar; and
among the rest, who flew 'into a passion, but your friend the
philosopher.  In short, one of the actors, advancing to the
front of the stage to make an apology for the manager, he had
scarce begun to say, "Mr. Fleetwood--" when your friend, with
a most audible voice and dignity of anger, called out, "He is
an impudent rascal!"  The whole pit huzzaed, and repeated the
words.  Only think of my being a popular orator! But what was
still better, while my shadow of a person was dilating to the
consistence of a hero, One of the chief ringleaders of the
riot, coming under the box where I sat, and pulling off his
hat, said, "Mr.  Walpole, what would you please to have us do
next?" It is impossible to describe to you the confusion into
which this apostrophe threw me.  I sank down into the box, and
have never since ventured to set my foot into the playhouse.
The next night, the uproar was repeated with greater violence,
and nothing was heard but voices calling out, "Where's Mr. W.?
where's Mr. W.?"  In short, the whole town has been
entertained with my prowess, and Mr. Conway has given me the
name of Wat Tyler; which, I believe, would have stuck by me,
if this new episode of Lord Granville had not luckily
interfered.

We every minute expect news of the Mediterranean engagement
for, besides your account, Birtles has written the same from
Genoa.  We expect good news, too, from Prince Charles, who is
driving the King of Prussia before him.  In the mean time, his
wife the Archduchess is dead, which may be a signal loss to
him.

I forgot to tell you that, on Friday, Lord Charles Hay,(989)
who has more of the parts of an Irishman than of a Scot, told
my Lady Granville at the drawing-room, on her seeing so full a
court, "that people were come out of curiosity."  The
Speaker,(990) is the happiest of any man in these bustles: he
says, "this Parliament has torn two favourite ministers from
the throne."  His conclusion is, that the power of the
Parliament will in the end be so great, that nobody can be
minister but their own speaker.

Winnington says my Lord Chesterfield and Pitt will have places
before old Marlborough's legacy to them for being patriots is
paid.  My compliments to the family of Suares on the
Vittorina's marriage.  Adieu!

(986) By the death of his mother, Lord Carteret had become
Earl Granville.-E.

(987) George, Earl Cholmondeley.

(988) Bishop of Lincoln [successively translated to Salisbury
and Winchester.  He died in 1781.]

(989) Brother of Lord Tweedale.

(990) Arthur Onslow.



397 Letter 153
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec.  '24, 1744.

You will wonder what has become of me: nothing has.  I know it
is above three weeks since I wrote to you; but I will tell you
the reason.  I have kept a parliamentary silence, which I must
'explain to you.  Ever since Lord Granville went out, all has
been in suspense. The leaders of the Opposition immediately
imposed silence upon their party; every thing passed without
the least debate--in short, all were making their bargains.
One has heard of the corruption of courtiers; but believe me,
the impudent prostitution of patriots, going to market with
their honesty, beats it to nothing.  Do but think of two
hundred men of the most consummate virtue, setting themselves
to sale for three weeks!  I have been reprimanded by the wise
for saying that they all stood like servants at a country
statute fair to be hired.  All this while nothing was certain:
one day the coalition was settled; the next, the treaty broke
off-I hated to write to you what I might contradict next post.
Besides, in my last letter I remember telling you that the
Archduchess was dead; she did not die till a fortnight
afterwards.

The result of the whole is this: the King, instigated by Lord
Granville, has used all his ministry as ill as possible, and
has with the greatest difficulty been brought to consent to
the necessary changes.  Mr. Pelham has had as much difficulty
to regulate the disposition of places.  Numbers of lists of
the hungry have been given in by their centurions of those,
several Tories have refused to accept the proffered posts
some, from an impossibility of being rechosen for their
Jacobite counties.  But upon the whole, it appears that their
leaders have had very little influence with them; for not
above four or five are come into place.  The rest will stick
to Opposition.  Here is a list of the changes, as made last
Saturday:

Duke of Devonshire, Lord Steward, in the room of the Duke of
Dorset.
Duke of Dorset, Lord President, in Lord Harrington's room.
Lord Chesterfield,+ Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in the Duke of
Devonshire's.
Duke of Bedford,+ Lord Sandwich,+ George Grenville,+ Lord Vere
Beauclerc,(991) and Admiral Anson, Lords of the Admiralty, in
the room of Lord Winchilsea,* Dr. Lee,* Cockburn,* Sir Charles
Hardy,* and Philipson.*
Mr. Arundel and George Lyttelton,f Lords of the Treasury, in
the room of Compton* and Gybbon.*
Lord Gowerf again Privy Seal, in Lord Cholmondeley's* room,
who is made Vice-Treasurer of Ireland in Harry Vane's.*
Mr. Doddington,+ Treasurer of the Navy, in Sir John
Rushout's.*
Mr. Waller,+ Cofferer, in Lord Sandys'.*
Lord Hobart, Captain of the Pensioners, in Lord Bathurst's.*
Sir John Cotton, +(992) Treasurer of the Chambers, in Lord
Hobart'S.(993)
Mr. Keene, Paymaster of the Pensions, in Mr. Hooper's.*
Sir John Philippsf and John Pitt+ Commissioners of Trade, in
Mr. Keene's and Sir Charles Gilmour's.*
William Chetwynd,+ Master of the Mint, in Mr. Arundel's.
Lord Halifax,+ Master of the Buck-hounds, in Mr. Jennison's,
who has a pension.

All those with a cross are from the Opposition; those with a
star, the turned-out, and are of the Granville and Bath
squadron, except Lord Cholmondeley, (who, too, had connected
with the former,) and Mr. Philipson.  The King parted with
great regret with Lord Cholmondeley, and complains loudly of
the force put upon him.  The Prince, who is full as warm as
his father for Lord Granville, has already turned out
Lyttelton, who was his secretary, and Lord Halifax; and has
named Mr. Drax and Lord Inchiquin(994) in their places.  You
perceive the great Mr. William Pitt is not in the list, though
he comes thoroughly into the measures.  To preserve his
character and authority in the Parliament, he was unwilling to
accept any thing yet: the ministry very rightly insisted that
he should; he asked for secretary at war, knowing it would be
refused-and it was.(995)

By this short sketch, and it is impossible to be more
explanatory, you will perceive that all is confusion: all
parties broken to Pieces, and the whole Opposition by tens and
by twenties selling themselves for profit-power they get none!
It is not easy to say where power resides at present: it is
plain that it resides not in the King; and yet he has enough
to hinder any body else from having it.  His new governors
have no interest with him-scarce any converse with him.

The Pretender's son is owned in France as Prince of Wales; the
princes of the blood have been to visit him in form.  The
Duchess of Chateauroux is poisoned there; so their monarch is
as ill-used as our most gracious King!(996)  How go your
Tuscan affairs? I am always trembling for you, though I am
laughing at every thing else.  My father is pretty well: he is
taking a preparation of Mr. Stephens's(997) medicine; but I
think all his physicians begin to agree that he has no large
stone.

Adieu! my dear child: I think the present comedy cannot be of
long duration.  the Parliament is adjourned for the holidays;
I am impatient to see the first division.

(991) Lord Vere Beauclerc, third son of the first Duke of St.
Albans, afterwards created Lord Vere, of Hanworth.  He entered
early into a maritime life, and distinguished himself in
several commands, He died in 1781.-E.

(992) The King was much displeased that an adherent of the
exiled family should be forced into the service of his own. in
consequence of this appointment a caricature was circulated,
representing the ministers thrusting Sir John, who was
extremely corpulent, down the King's throat.

(993) John, first Lord Hobart, so created in 1728, by the
interest of his sister, Lady Suffolk, the mistress of George
the Second.  In 1746 he was created Earl of Buckinghamshire;
and died in 1756.-D.

(994) William O'Brien, fourth Earl of Inchiquin, in Ireland.
He died in 1777.-E.

(995) Pitt alone was placeless.  He loftily declared, that he
would accept no office except that of secretary at war, and
the ministers were not yet able to dispense with Sir William
Yonge in that department.  This resolution of Pitt, joined to
the King's pertinacity against him, excluded him, for the
present, from any share in power."-Lord Mahon, vol. iii. p.
315.

(996) The Duchess died on the 8th of December.  The Biog.
Univ. says, that the rumour of her having been poisoned was
altogether without foundation.-E.

(997) It was Dr. Jurin's preparation.



399 Letter 154
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 4, 1745.

When I receive your long letters I am ashamed: mine are notes
in comparison.  How do you contrive to roll out your patience
into two sheets? You certainly don't love me better than I do
you; and yet if our loves were to b@ sold by the quire, you
would have by far the more magnificent stock to dispose of.  I
can only say that age has already an effect on the vigour of
my pen; none on yours: it is not, I assure you, for you alone,
but my ink is at low water-mark for all my acquaintance.  My
present shame arises from a letter of eight sides, of December
8th, which I received from you last post; but before I say a
word to that, I must tell you that I have at last received the
cases; three with gesse figures, and one with Lord Conway's
gun- barrels: I thought there were to be four, besides the
guns; but I quite forget, and did not even remember what they
were to contain.  Am not I in your debt again? Tell me, for
you know how careless I am.  Look over your list, and see
whether I have received all.  There were four barrels, the
Ganymede, the Sleeping Cupid, the model of my statue, the
Musaeum Florentinum, and some seeds for your brother.  But
alas! though I received them in gross, I did not at all in
detail; the model was broken into ten thousand bits, and the
Ganymede shorn in two: besides some of the fingers quite
reduced to powder.  Rysbrach has undertaken to mend him.  The
little Morpheus arrived quite whole, and is charmingly pretty;
I like it better in plaster than in the original black marble.

It is not being an upright senator to promise one's vote
beforehand, especially in a money matter; but I believe so
many excellent patriots have just done the same thing, that I
shall venture readily to engage my promise to you, to get you
any sum for the defence of Tuscany -why it is to defend you
and my own country! my own palace in via di santo
spirits,(998) my own Princess `epuis`ee, and all my family! I
shall quite make interest for you: nay, I would speak to our
new ally, and your old acquaintance, Lord Sandwich, to assist
in it; but I could have no hope of getting at his ear, for he
has put on such a first-rate tie-wig, on his admission to the
admiralty board, that nothing without the lungs of a boatswain
can ever think to penetrate the thickness of the curls.  I
think, however, it does honour to the dignity of ministers:
when he was but a patriot, his wig was not of half its present
gravity.  There are no more changes made: all is quiet yet;
but next Thursday the Parliament meets to decide the
complexion of the session.  My Lord Chesterfield goes next
week to Holland, and then returns for Ireland.

The great present disturbance in politics is my Lady
Granville's assembly; which I do assure you distresses the
Pelhams infinitely more than a mysterious meeting of the
States would, and far more than the abrupt breaking up of the
Diet at Grodno.  She had begun to keep Tuesdays before her
lord resigned, which now she continues with greater zeal.  Her
house is very fine, she very handsome, her lord very agreeable
and extraordinary; and yet the Duke of Newcastle wonders that
people will go thither. He mentioned to my father my going
there, who laughed at him; Cato's a proper person to trust
with such a childish  jealousy!  Harry Fox says, "Let the Duke
of Newcastle open his own house, and see if all that come
thither are his friends."  The fashion now is to send cards to
the women, and to declare that all men Are welcome without
being asked.  This is a piece of ease that shocks the prudes
of the last age.  You can't imagine how my Lady Granville
shines in doing favours; you know she is made for it.  My lord
has new furnished his mother's apartment for her, and has
given her a magnificent set of dressing plate: he is very fond
of her, and she as fond of his being so.

You will have heard of Marshal Belleisle's being made a
prisoner at Hanover: the world will believe it was not by
accident.  He is sent for over hither: the first thought was
to confine him to the Tower, but that is contrary to the
politesse of modern war: they talk of sending him to
Nottingham, where Tallard was.  I am sure, if he is prisoner
at large anywhere, we could not have a worse inmate! so
ambitious and intriguing a man, who was author of this whole
war, will be no bad general to be ready to head the Jacobites
on any insurrection.(999)

I can say nothing more about young Gardiner, but that I don't
think my father at all inclined now to have any letter written
for him.  Adieu!

(999) Belleisle and his brother, who had been sent by the King

of France on a mission to the King of Prussia, were detained,
while changing horses, at Elbengerode, and from thence
conveyed to England; where, refusing to give their parole in
the mode it was required, they were confined in Windsor
Castle.




400 Letter 155
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 14, 1745.

I have given my uncle the letter from M. de Magnan; he had
just received another from him at Venice, to desire his
recommendation to you.  His history is, first,-the Regent
picked him up, (I don't know from whence, but he is of the
Greek church,) to teach the present Duke of Orleans the Russ
tongue, when they had a scheme for marrying him into Muscovy.
At Paris, Lord Waldegrave(1000) met with him, and sent him
over hither, where they pensioned him and he was to be a spy,
but made nothing out; till the King was weary of giving him
money, and then they despatched him to Vienna, with a
recommendation to Count d'Uhlefeldt, who, I suppose, has
tacked him upon the Great Duke.  My uncle says, he knows no
ill of him; that you may be civil to him, but not enter into
correspondence with him, you need not; he is of no use.
Apropos to you; I have been in a fright about you; we were
told that Prince Lobkowitz was landed at Harwich; I did not
like the name; and as he has been troublesome to you, I did
not know but he might fancy he had some complaints against
you.  I wondered you had never mentioned his being set out;
but it is his son, a travelling boy of twenty; he is sent
under the care of an apothecary and surgeon.

The Parliament is met: one hears of the Tory Opposition
continuing, but nothing has appeared; all is quiet.  Lord
Chesterfield is set out for the Hague - I don't know what ear
the States will lend to his embassy, when they hear with what
difficulty the King was brought to give him a parting
audience; and which, by a watch, did not last five-and-forty
seconds.  The Granville faction are still the constant and
only countenanced people at court.  Lord Winchilsea, one of
the disgraced, played at court On Twelfth-night, and won: the
King asked him the next morning, how much he had for his own
share?(1001)  He replied, "Sir, about a quarter's salary."  I
liked the spirit, and was talking to him Of it the next night
at Lord Granville's: "Why, yes," said he, "I think it showed
familiarity at least: tell it your father--I don't think he
will dislike it." My Lady Granville gives a ball this week,
but in a manner a private one, to the two families of Carteret
and Fermor and their intimacies: there is a fourth sister,
Lady Jullana,(1002) who is very handsome, but I think not so
well as Sophia: the latter thinks herself breeding.

I will tell you a very good thing: Lord Baltimore will not
come into the admiralty, because in the new commission they
give Lord Vere Beauclerc the precedence to him, and he has
dispersed printed papers with precedents in his favour.  A
gentleman, I don't know who, the other night at Tom's
coffee-house, said, "It put him in mind of Ponkethman's
petition in the Spectator, where he complains, that formerly
he used to act second chair in Dioclesian, but now was reduced
to dance fifth flowerpot."

The Duke of Montagu has found out an old penny-history-book,
called the Old Woman's Will of Ratcliffe-Highway, which he has
bound up with his mother-in-law's, Old Marlborough,(1003)
only-tearing away the title-page of the latter.

My father has been extremely ill this week with his disorder--
I think the physicians are more and more persuaded that it is
the stone in his bladder.  He is taking a preparation of Mrs.
Stevens's medicine, a receipt of one Dr. Jurin, which we began
to fear was too violent for him: I made his doctor angry with
me, by arguing on this medicine, which I never could
comprehend.  it is of so great violence, that it Is to split a
stone when it arrives at it, and yet it is to do no damage to
all the tender intestines through which it must first
pass.(1004)  I told him, I thought it was like an admiral
going on a secret expedition of war, with instructions, which
are not to be opened till he arrives in such a latitude.

George Townshend,(1005) my lord's eldest son, who is at the
Hague on his travels, has had an offer to raise a regiment for
their service, of which he is to be colonel, with power of
naming all his own officers.  It was proposed, that it should
consist of Irish Roman Catholics, but the regency of Ireland
have represented against that, because they think they will
all desert to the French. He is now to try it of Scotch, which
will scarce succeed, unless he will let all the officers be of
the same nation.  An affair of this kind first raised the late
Duke of Argyll; and was the cause of the first quarrel with
the Duke of Marlborough, who was against his coming into our
army in the same rank.

Sir Thomas Hanmer has at last published his Shakspeare: he has
made several alterations, but they will be the less talked of,
as he has not marked in the text, margin, or notes, where or
why he has made any change; but every body must be obliged to
collate it with other editions.  One most curiously absurd
alteration I have been told.  In Othello, it is said of
Cassio, "a Florentine, one almost damned in a fair wife."  It
happens that there is no other mention in the play of Cassio's
wife.  Sir Thomas has altered it-how do you think?-no, I
should be sorry if you could think how-"almost damned in a
fair phiz!"-what a tragic word! and what sense!

Adieu! I see advertised a translation of Dr. Cocchi's book on
living on vegetables:(1006)  Does he know any thing of it? My
service to him and every body.

402 letter 156
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 1, 1745.

I am glad my letters, obscure as they of course must be, give
you any light into England; but don't mind them too much; they
may be partial; must be imperfect: don't negotiate upon their
authority, but have Capello's(1007) example before your eyes!
How I laugh when I see him important, and see my Lady
Pomfret's letters at the bottom of his instructions! how it
would make a philosopher smile at the vanity of politics! How
it diverts me, who can entertain myself at the expense of
philosophy, politics, or any thing else! Mr. Conway says I
laugh at all serious characters-so I do-and at myself too, who
am far from being of the number.  Who would not laugh at a
world, where so ridiculous a creature as the Duke of Newcastle
can overturn ministries! Don't take me for a partisan of Lord
Granville's because I despise his rivals; I am not for
adopting his measures; they were wild and dangerous -. in his
single capacity, I think him a great genius(1008) and without
having recourse to the Countess's translatable periods, am
pleased with his company.  His frankness charms one when it is
not necessary to depend upon it: and his contempt for fools is
very flattering to any one who happens to know the present
ministry.  Their coalition goes on as One should expect; they
have the name of having effected it; and the Opposition is no
longer mentioned: yet there is not a half-witted prater in the
House but can divide with every new minister on his side,
except Lyttelton, whenever he pleases.  They actually do every
day bring in popular bills, and on the first tinkling of the
brass, all the new bees swarm back to the Tory side of the
House.  The other day, on the Flanders army, Mr. Pitt came
down to prevent this: he was very ill, but made a very strong
and much admired speech for coalition,(1009) which for that
day succeeded, and the army was voted with but one negative,.
But now the Emperor (1010) is dead, and every thing must wear
a new face.  If it produces a peace, Mr. Pelham is a fortunate
man!  He will do extremely well at the beginning of peace,
like the man in Madame de la Fayette's Memoirs, Qui exer`coit
extr`emement bien sa charge, quand il n'avoit rien `a faire."
However, do you keep well with them, and be sure don't write
me back any treason, in answer to all I write to you: you are
to please them; I think of them -is they are.

The new Elector(1011) seems to set out well for us, though
there are accounts of his having taken the style of Archduke,
as claiming the Austrian succession: if he has, it will be
like the children's game of beat knaves out of doors, where
you play the pack twenty times over; one gets pam, the other
gets pam, but there is no conclusion to the game till one side
has never a card left.

After my ill success with the baronet,(1012) to whom I gave a
letter for
 you.  I shall always be very cautious how I recommend
barbarians to your protection.  I have this morning been
solicited for some credentials for a Mr. Oxenden.(1013)  I
could not help laughing: he is a son of Sir George, my Lady
W.'s famous lover! Can he want recommendations to Florence?
However, I must give him a letter; but beg you will not give
yourself any particular trouble about him, for I
do not know him enough to bow to.  His person is good: that
and his name, I suppose, will bespeak my lady's attentions,
and save you the fatigue of doing him many honours.

Thank Mr. Chute for his letter; I will answer it very soon.  I
delight in the article of the Mantua Gazette.  Adieu!

(1009) "Mr. Pitt, who had been laid up with the gout, came
down with the mien and apparatus of an invalid, on purpose to
make a full declaration of his sentiments on our present
circumstances.  What he said was enforced with much grace both
of action and elocution.  He commended the ministry for
pursuing moderate and healing measures, and such -,is tended
to set the King at the head of all his people." See Mr.- P.

404 Letter 157
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 28, 1745.

You have heard from your brother the reason of my not having
written to you so long.  I have been out but twice since my
father fell into this illness, which is now near a month; and
all that time either continually in his room, or obliged to
see multitudes of people; for it is most wonderful how every
body of all kinds has affected to express their concern for
him.  He has been out of danger above this week; but I can't
say he mended at all perceptibly, till these last three days.
His spirits are amazing, and his constitution more; for Dr.
Hulse, said honestly from the first, that if he recovered, it
would be from his own strength, not from their art.  After the
four or five first days, in which they gave him the bark, they
resigned him to the struggles of his own good temperament-and
it has surmounted! surmounted an explosion and discharge of
thirty-two pieces of stone, a constant and vast effusion of
blood for five days, a fever of three weeks, a perpetual flux
of water, and sixty-nine years, already (one should think)
worn down with his vast fatigues! How much more he will ever
recover, one scarce dare hope about: for us, he is greatly
recovered; for himself-

March 4th.

I had written thus far last week, without being able to find a
moment to finish.  In the midst of all my attendance on my
lord and receiving visits, I am forced to go out and thank
those that have come and sent; for his recovery is now at such
a pause, that I fear it is in vain to expect much farther
amendment.  How dismal a prospect for him, with the possession
of the greatest understanding in the world, not the least
impaired to lie without any use of it! for to keep him from
pains and restlessness, he takes so much opiate, that he is
scarce awake four hours of the four-and-twenty; but I -will
say no more on this.

Our coalition goes on thrivingly; but at the expense of the
old Court, who are all discontented, and are likely soon to
show their resentment.  The brothers have seen the best days
of their ministry.  The Hanover troops dismissed to please the
Opposition, and taken again with their consent, under the
cloak of an additional subsidy to the Queen of Hungary, who is
to pay them.  This has set the patriots in so villainous a
light, that they will be ill able to support a minister who
has thrown such an odium on the Whigs, after they had so
stoutly supported that measure last year, and which, after all
the clamour, is now universally adopted, as you see.  If my
Lord Granville had any resentment, as he seems to have nothing
but thirst, sure there is no vengeance he might not take! So
far from contracting any prudence from his fall, he laughs it
off every night over two or three bottles.  The countess is
with child.  I believe she and the countess-mother have got
it; for there is nothing ridiculous which they have not done
and said about it.  There was a private masquerade lately at
the Venetian ambassadress's for the Prince of Wales, who named
the company, and expressly excepted my Lady Lincoln and others
of the Pelham faction.  My Lady Granville came late, dressed
like Imoinda, and handsomer than one of the houris - the
Prince asked her why she would not dance? , Indeed, Sir, I was
afraid I could not have come at all, for I had a fainting fit
after dinner." The other night my Lady Townshend made a great
ball on her son's coming of age: I went for a little while,
little thinking of dancing.  I asked my Lord Granville, why my
lady did not dance?  "Oh, Lord! I wish you would ask her: she
will with you." I was caught, and did walk down one country
dance with her; but the prudent Signora-madre would not let
her expose the young Carteret any farther.

You say, you expect much information about Belleisle, but
there has not (in the style of the newspapers) the least
particular transpired.  He was at first kept magnificently
close at Windsor; but the expense proving above one hundred
pounds per day, they have taken his parole, and sent him to
Nottingham, `a la Tallarde.  Pray, is De Sade with you still'?
his brother has been taken too by the Austrians.

My Lord Coke is going to be married to a Miss Shawe,(1014) of
forty thousand pounds.  Lord Hartington(1015) is contracted to
Lady Charlotte Boyle, the heiress of Burlington, and sister of
the unhappy Lady Euston; but she is not yet old enough.  Earl
Stanhope,(1016) too, has at last lifted up his eyes from
Euclid, and directed them to matrimony.  He has chosen the
eldest sister of your acquaintance Lord Haddington.  I revive
about you and Tuscany.  I will tell you. what is thought to
have reprieved you: it is much suspected that the King of
Spain(1017) is dead.  I hope those superstitious people will
pinch the queen, as they do witches, to make her loosen the
charm that has kept the Prince of Asturias from having
children.  At least this must turn out better than the death
of the Emperor has.

The Duke,(1018) you hear, is named generalissimo, with Count
Koningseg, Lord Dunmore,(1019) and Ligonier,(1020) under him.
Poor boy! he is most Brunswickly happy with his drums and
trumpets.  Do but think that this sugar-plum was to tempt him
to swallow that bolus the Princess of Denmark!(1021)  What
will they do if they have children?  The late Queen never
forgave the Duke of Richmond, for telling her that his
children would take place before the Duke's grandchildren.

I inclose you a pattern for a chair, which your brother
desired me to send you.  I thank you extremely for the views
of Florence; you can't imagine what wishes they have awakened.
My best thanks to Dr. Cocci for his book: I have delivered all
the copies as directed.  Mr. Chute will excuse me yet; the
first moment I have time I will write.  I have: just received
your letter of Feb. 16, and grieve for your disorder: you
know, how much concern your ill health gives m.  Adieu! my
dear child: I write with twenty people in the room.

(1014) This marriage did not take place.  Lord Coke afterwards
married Lady Campbell; and Miss Shawe, William, fifth Lord
Byron, the immediate predecessor of the great poet.-E.

(1015) In 1755 he succeeded his father as fourth Duke of
Devonshire.  He died at Spa, in 1764; having filled at
different times, the offices of lord lieutenant of Ireland,
first lord of the treasury, and lord chamberlain of the
household.  His marriage with Lady Charlotte Boyle took place
in March 1748.-E.

(1016) Philip, second Earl Stanhope.  See ant`e, p. 308.
Letter 96.  He married, in July following, Lady Grizel
Hamilton, daughter of Charles Lord Binning.-E.

(1017) The imbecile and insane Philip V. He did not die till
1746.  The Prince of Asturias was Ferdinand VI., who succeeded
him, and died childless in 1759.-D.

(1018) Of Cumberland.  He never married.-D.

(1019) John Murray, second Earl of Dunmore: colonel of the
third regiment of Scotch foot-guards.  He died in 1752-E.

(1020) Sir John Ligonier a general of merit.  He was created
Lord Ligonier in Ireland, in 1757, an English peer by the same
title in 1763, and Earl Ligonier in 1766.  He died at the
great age of ninety-one, in 1770.-D.

(1021) The Princess was deformed and- ugly. "Having in vain
remonstrated with the King against the marriage, the Duke sent
his governor, mr. Poyntz, to consult Lord Orford how to avoid
the match.  After reflecting a few moments, Orford advised
'that the Duke should give his consent, on condition of his
receiving an ample and immediate establishment; and believe
me,' added he, 'that the match will be no longer pressed.'
The Duke followed the advice, and the result fulfilled the
prediction "' Lord Mahon, vol. iii. p. 321.-E.



406 Letter 158
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 29, 1745.

I begged your brother to tell you what it was impossible for
me to tell you.(1023)  You share nearly in our common loss!
Don't expect me to enter at all upon the subject.  After the
melancholy two months, that I have passed, and in my
situation, you will not wonder I shun a conversation which
could not be bounded by a letter-a letter that would grow into
a panegyric, or a piece of moral; improper for me to write
upon, and too distressful for us both!-a death is only to be
felt, never to be talked over by those it touches!

I had yesterday your letter of three sheets - I began to
flatter myself that the storm was blown over, but I tremble to
think of the danger you are in! a danger, in which even the
protection of the great friend you have lost could have been
of no service to you.  How ridiculous it seems for me to renew
protestations of my friendship for you, at an instant when my
father is just dead, and the Spaniards just bursting into
Tuscany! How empty a charm would my name have, when all my
interest and significance are buried in my father's grave! All
hopes of present peace, the only thing that could save you,
seem vanished.  We expect every day to hear of the French
declaration of war against Holland.  The new Elector of
Bavaria is French, like his father; and the King of Spain is
not dead.  I don't know how to talk to you.  I have not even a
belief that the Spaniards will spare Tuscany.  My dear child
what will become of you? whither will you retire till a peace
restores you to your ministry? for upon that distant view
alone I repose!

We are every day nearer confusion.  The King is in as bad
humour as a monarch can be; he wants to go abroad, and is
detained by the Mediterranean affair; the inquiry into which
was moved by a Major Selwyn, a dirty pensioner, half-turned
patriot, by the Court being overstocked with votes.(1024)
This inquiry takes up the whole time of the House of Commons,
but I don't see what conclusion it can have. My confinement
has kept me from being there, except the first day; and all I
know of what is yet come out is, as it was stated by a Scotch
member the other day, "that there had been one (Matthews) with
a bad head, another, (Lestock) with a worse heart, and four
(the captains of the inactive ships) with no heart at all."
Among the numerous visits of form that I have received, one
was from my Lord Sandys: as we two could only converse upon
general topics, we fell upon this of the Mediterranean, and I
made him allow, "that, to be sure, there is not so bad a court
of justice in the world as the House of Commons; and how hard
it is upon any man to have his cause tried there!"

Sir Everard Falkner(1025) is made secretary to the Duke, who
is not yet gone: I have got Mr. Conway to be one of his
aide-de-camps.  Sir Everard has since been offered the
joint-Postmastersh'ip, vacant by Sir John Iyles'S(1026) death;
but he would not quit the Duke.  It was then proposed to the
King to give it to the brother: it happened to be a cloudy
day, and he, only answered, ,I know who Sir Everard is, but I
don't know who Mr. Falkner is."

The world expects some change when the Parliament rises.  My
Lord Granville's physicians have ordered him to go to the Spa,
as, you know, they often send ladies to the Bath who are very
ill of a want of diversion.  It will scarce be possible for
the present ministry to endure this jaunt.  Then they are
losing many of their new allies: the new Duke of
Beaufort,(1027) a most determined and unwavering Jacobite, has
openly set himself at the head of that party, and forced them
to vote against the Court, and to renounce my Lord Gower.  My
wise cousin, Sir John Phillipps, has resigned his place; and
it is believed that Sir John Cotton will soon resign but the
Bedford, Pitt, Lyttelton, and that squadron, stick close to
their places.  Pitt has lately resigned his bedchamber to the
Prince, which, in friendship to Lyttelton, it was expected he
would have done long ago.  They have chosen for this
resignation a very apposite passage out of Cato:

"He toss'd his arm aloft, and proudly told me
He would not stay, and perish like Sempronius."

This was Williams's.

My Lord Coke's match is broken off, upon some coquetry of the
lady with Mr. Mackenzie,(1028) at the Ridotto.  My Lord
Leicester says, there shall not be a third lady in Norfolk of
the species of the two fortunes(1029) that matched at Rainham
and Houghton."  Pray, will the new Countess of Orford come to
England?

The town flocks to a new play of Thomson's, called Tancred and
Sigismunda: it is very dull, I have read it.(1030)  I cannot
bear modern poetry; these refiners of the purity of the stage,
and of the incorrectness of English verse, are most
-,,,wofully insipid.  I had rather have written the most
absurd lines in Lee, than Leonidas or the Seasons; as I had
rather be put into the round-house for a wrong-headed quarrel,
than sup quietly at eight o'clock with my grandmother.  There
is another of these tame geniuses, a Mr. Akenside,(1031)  who
writes Odes: in one he has lately published, he says, "Light
the tapers, urge the fire." Had not you rather make gods
jostle 'in the dark, than light the candles for fear they
should break their heads? One Russel, a mimic, has a
puppet-show to ridicule operas; I hear, very dull, not to
mention its being twenty years too late: it consists of three
acts, with foolish Italian songs burlesqued in Italian.

There is a very good quarrel on foot between two duchesses;
she of Queensberry sent to invite Lady Emily Lennox(1032) to a
ball: her Grace of Richmond, who is wonderfully cautious since
Lady Caroline's elopement, sent word, "she could not
determine." The other sent again the same night: the same
answer.  The Queensberry then sent word, that she had made up
her company, and desired to be excused from having Lady
Emily's; but at the bottom of the card wrote, "Too great a
trust." You know how mad she is, and how capable of such a
stroke.  There is no declaration of war come out from the
other duchess; but, I believe it will be made a national
quarrel of the whole illegitimate royal family.

It is the present fashion to make conundrums: there are books
of them printed, and produced at all assemblies: they are full
silly enough to be made a fashion.  I will tell you the most
renowned--"Why is my uncle Horace like two people
conversing?-Because he is both teller and auditor."  This was
Winnington's.

Well, I had almost forgot to tell you a most extraordinary
impertinence of your Florentine Marquis Riccardi.  About three
weeks ago, I received a letter by Monsieur Wastier's footman
from the marquis.  He tells me most cavalierly, that he has
sent me seventy-seven antique gems to sell for him, by the way
of Paris, not caring it should be known in Florence.  He will
have them sold altogether, and the lowest price two thousand
pistoles.  You know what no-acquaintance I had with him.  I
shall be as frank as he, and not receive them.  If I did, they
might be lost in sending back, and then I must pay his two
thousand doppie di Spagna.  The refusing to receive them is
Positively all the notice I shall take of it.

I enclose what I think a fine piece on my father:(1033)  it
was written by Mr. Ashton, whom you have often heard me
mention as a particular friend.  You see how I try to make out
a long letter, in return for your kind one, which yet gave me
great pain by telling me of your fever.  My dearest Sir, it is
terrible to have illness added to your other distresses! .

I will take the first opportunity to send Dr. Cocchi his
translated book; I have not yet seen it myself.

Adieu! my dearest child! I write with a house full of
relations, and must conclude.  Heaven preserve you and
Tuscany.

(1023) The death of Lord Orford. - He expired," says Coxe, "on
the 18th of March, 1745, in the sixty-ninth year of his age.  His
remains were interred in the parish church at Houghton,
without monument or inscription-

"So peaceful rests, without a stone, a name,
Which once had honours, titles, wealth and fame!"-E.

(1024) "February 26.-We had an unexpected motion from a very
contemptible fellow, Major Selwyn, for an inquiry into the
cause of the miscarriage of the fleet in the action off
Toulon.  Mr. Pelham, perceiving that the inclination of the
House was for an inquiry, acceded to the motion; but
forewarned it of the temper, patience, and caution with which
it should be pursued."-Mr. Yorke's MS.  Journal.-E.

(1025) He had been ambassador at Constantinople.

(1026) Sir John Eyles, Bart. an alderman of the city of
London, and at one time member of parliament for the same.  He
died March 11, 1745.-D.

(1027) Charles Noel Somerset, fourth Duke of Beaufort,
succeeded his elder brother Henry in the dukedom, February 14,
1745.-D.

(1028) The Hon.  James Stuart Mackenzie, second son of James,
second Earl of Bute, and brother of John, Earl of Bute, the
minister.  He married Lady Elizabeth Campbell, one of the
daughters of John, the great Duke of Argyll, and died in
1800.-D.

(1029) Margaret Rolle, Countess of Orford, and Ethelreda
Harrison, Viscountess Townshend.

(1030) This was the most successful of all Thomson's plays;
"but it may be doubted," says Dr. Johnson, " whether he was,
either by the bent of nature or habits of study, much
qualified for tragedy: it does not appear that he had much

410 Letter 159
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 15, 1745.

By this time you have heard of my Lord's death: I fear it will
have been a very great shock to you.  I hope your brother will
write you all the particulars; for my part, you can't expect I
should enter into the details of it.  His enemies pay him the
compliment of saying, they do believe now that he did not
plunder the public,, as he was accused (as they accused him)
of doing, he having died in such circumstances." If he had no
proofs of his honesty but this, I don't think this would be
such indisputable authority: not having immense riches would
be scanty evidence of his not having acquired them, there
happening to be such a thing as spending them.  It is certain,
he is dead very poor: his debts, with his legacies, which are
trifling, amount to fifty thousand pounds.  His estate, a
nominal eight thousand a-year, much mortgaged.  In short, his
fondness for Houghton has endangered Houghton.  If he had not
so overdone it, he -might have left such an estate to his
family as might have secured the glory of the place for many
years: another such debt must expose it to sale.  If he had
lived, his unbounded generosity and contempt of money would
have run him into vast difficulties.  However irreparable his
personal loss may be to his friends, he certainly died
critically well for himself: he had lived to stand the rudest
trials with honour, to see his character universally cleared,
his enemies brought to infamy for their ignorance or villainy,
and the world allowing him to be the only man in England fit
to be what he had been; and he died at a time when his age and
infirmities prevented his again undertaking the support of a
government, which engrossed his whole care, and which he
foresaw was falling into the last confusion.  In this I hope
his judgment failed! His fortune attended him to the last; for
he died of the most painful of all distempers, with little or
no pain.


The House of Commons have at last finished their great affair,
their inquiry into the Mediterranean miscarriage.  It was
carried on with more decency and impartiality than ever was
known in so tumultuous, popular, and partial a court.  I can't
say it ended so; for the Tories, all but one single man, voted
against Matthews, whom they have not forgiven for lately
opposing one of their friends in Monmouthshire, and for
carrying his election.  The greater part of the Whigs were for
Lestock.  This last is a very great man: his cause, most
unfriended, came before the House with all the odium that
could be laid on a man standing in the light of having
betrayed his country.  His merit, I mean his parts, prevailed,
and have set him in a very advantageous point of view.  Harry
Fox has gained the greatest honour by his assiduity and
capacity in this affair.  Matthews remains in the light of a
hot, brave, imperious, dull, confused fellow.  The question
was to address the King to appoint a trial, by court-martial,
of the two admirals and the four coward captains.  Matthews's
friends were for leaving out his name, but, after a very long
debate, were only 76 to 218.  It is generally supposed, that
the two admirals will be acquitted and the captains hanged.
By what I can make out, (for you know I have been confined,
and could not attend the examination,) Lestock preferred his
own safety to the glory of his country; I don't mean cowardly,
for he is most unquestionably brave, but selfishly.  Having to
do with a man who, he knew, would take the slightest
opportunity to ruin him, if he in the least transgressed his
orders, and knowing that man too dull to give right orders, he
chose to stick to the letter, when, by neglecting it, he might
have done the greatest service.

We hear of great news from Bavaria, of that Elector being
forced into a neutrality; but it IS not confirmed.

Mr. Legge is made lord of the admiralty, and Mr. Philipson
surveyor of the roads in his room.  This is all I know.  I
look with anxiety every day into the Gazettes about Tuscany,
but hitherto I find all is quiet.  My dear Sir, I tremble for
you!


I have been much desired to get you to send five gesse
figures; the Venus, the Faun, the Mercury, the Cupid and
Psyche, and the little Bacchus; you know the original is
modern: if this is not to be had, then the Ganymede.  My dear
child, I am sorry to give you this trouble; order any body to
buy them, and to Send them from Leghorn by the first ship. let
me have the bill, and bill of lading.  Adieu!



411 Letter 160
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 29, 1745.

When you wrote your last of the 6th of this month, you was
still in hopes about my father.  I wish I had received your
letters on his death, for it is most shocking to have all the
thoughts opened again upon such a subject!-it is the great
disadvantage of a distant correspondence.  There was a report
here a fortnight ago of the new countess coming over.  She
could not then have heard it.  Can she be so mad? Why should
she suppose all her shame buried in my lord's grave? or does
not she know, has she seen so little of the world, as not to
be sensible that she will now return in a worse light than
ever? A few malicious, who would have countenanced her to vex
him, would now treat her like the rest of the world.  It is a
private family affair; a husband, a mother, and a son, all
party against her, all wounded by her conduct, would be too
much to get over!
 \\

My dear child, you have nothing but misfortunes of your
friends to lament.  You have new subject by the loss of poor
Mr. Chute's brother.(1034)  It really is a great loss! he was
a most rising man, and one of the best-natured and most honest
that ever lived.  If it would not sound ridiculously, though,
I assure you, I am far from feeling it lightly, I would tell
you of poor Patapan's death - he died about ten days ago.

This peace with the Elector of Bavaria may Produce a general
one.  You have given great respite to my uneasiness, by
telling me that Tuscany seems out of danger.  We have for
these last three days been in great expectation of a battle.
The French have invested Tournay; our army came up with them
last Wednesday, and is certainly little inferior, and
determined to attack them; but it is believed they are
retired: we don't know who commands them; it is said, the Duc
d'Harcourt.  Our good friend, the Count de Saxe, is
dying(1036)-by Venus, not by Mars.  The King goes on Friday;
this may make the young Duke(1036) more impatient to give
battle, to have all the honour his own.

There is no kind of news; the Parliament rises on Thursday,
and every body is going out of town.  I shall only make short
excursions in visits; you know I am not fond of the country,
and have no call into it now!  My brother will not be at
Houghton this year; he shuts it Up to enter on new, and there
very unknown economy: he has much occasion for it!  Commend me
to poor Mr. Chute!  Adieu!

(1034) Francis Chute, a very eminent lawyer.

(1035) The Marshal de Saxe- did not die till 1750.  He was,
however, exceedingly ill at the time of the battle of
Fontenoy.  Voltaire, in his "Si`ecle de Louis XV." mentions
having met him at Paris just as he was setting out for the
campaign.  Observing how unwell he seemed to b, he asked him
whether he thought he had strength enough to go through the
fatigues which awaited him.  To this the Marshal's reply was
"il ne s'agit pas de vivre, mais de partir."-D.

William, Duke of Cumberland.-D.



412 Letter 161
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 11, 1745.

I stayed till to-day, to be able to give you some account of
the battle of Tournay:(1037) the outlines you will have heard
already.  We don't allow it to be a victory on the French
side: but that is, just as a woman is not called Mrs. till she
is married, though she may have had half-a-dozen natural
children.  In short, we remained upon the field  of battle
three hours: I fear, too many of us remain there still!
without palliating, it is certainly a heavy stroke.  We never
lost near so many officers.  I pity the Duke, for it is almost
the first battle of consequence that we ever lost.  By the
letters arrived to-day we find that Tournay still holds out.
There are certainly killed Sir James Campbell, General
Ponsonby, Colonel Carpenter, Colonel Douglas, young Ross,
Colonel Montagu, Geo, Berkeley, and Kellet.  Mr. Vanbrugh is
since dead.  Most of the your),r men of quality in the Guards
@ are wounded.  I have had the vast fortune to have nobody
hurt, for whom I was in the least interested.  Mr. Conway, in
particular, has highly distinguished himself; he ind Lord
Petersham,' who is slightly wounded, are most commended;
though none behaved ill but the Dutch horse.  There has been
but very little consternation here: the King minded it so
little, that being set out for Hanover, and blown back into
Harwich-roads since the news came, he could not be persuaded
to return, but sailed yesterday with the fair wind.  I believe
you will have the Gazette sent Tonight; but lest it should not
be printed time enough, here is a list of the numbers, as it
came over this morning.

British foot 1237 killed.
Ditto horse 90 ditto.
Ditto foot 1968 wounded.
Ditto horse 232 ditto.
Ditto foot 457 missing.
Ditto horse 18 ditto.
Hanoverian foot 432 killed.
Ditto horse 78 ditto.
Ditto foot 950 wounded.
Ditto horse 192 ditto.
Ditto horse and foot 53 missing.
Dutch 625 killed and wounded.
Ditto 1019 missing.

So the whole hors de combat is above seven thousand three
hundred.  The French own the loss of three thousand; I don't
believe many more, for it was a most desperate and rash
perseverance on our side. The Duke behaved very bravely and
humanely;(1038) but this will not have advanced the peace.

However coolly the Duke may have behaved, and coldly his
father, at least his brother, has outdone both.  He not only
went to the play the night the news came, but in two days made
a ballad.  It is in imitation of the Regent's style, and has
miscarried in nothing but the language, the thoughts, and the
poetry.  Did I not tell you in my last that he was going to
act Paris in Congreve's Masque? The song is addressed to the
goddesses.

1. Venez, mes ch`eres D`eesses,
Venez calmer mon chagrin;
Aidez, mes belles Princesses,'

D'un charmant vis-a-vis.

Vite `a table je me mets,
Loin des objets que j'abhorre,
Avec joie j'y trouve la paix.

Je rassemble autour de moi,
Et je me ris de l'`etalage.
Qu'a chez lui toujours on Roi.

3. Que m'importe, que l'Europe
Ait Un, ou plusieurs tyrans?
Prions seulement Calliope,
Qu'elle inspire nos vers, nos chants.
Laissons Mars et toute la gloire;
Livrons nous tous `a l'amour;
Que Bacchus nous donne `a boire;
A ces deux fasions la cour.

4. Passons ainsi notre vie,
Sans rover IL ce qui suit;
Avec ma ch`ere Sylvie,(1039)
Le tems trop Vite me fuit.
Mais si, par Un malheur extr`eme,
Je perdois cet objet charmant,
Oui, cette compagnie m`eme
Ne me tiendroit Un moment.

5. me livrant `a ma tristesse,
Toujours plein de mon chagrin,
Je n'aurois plus d'all`egresse

Avec nous toujours heureuse!

Adieu! I am in a great hurry.

415 Letter 162
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 18, 1745.

Dear George,
I am very sorry to renew our correspondence upon so melancholy
a circumstance, but when you have lost so near a friend as
your brother,(1041) 'tis sure the duty of all your other
friends to endeavour to alleviate your loss, and offer all the
increase of affection that is possible to compensate it.  This
I do most heartily; I wish I could most effectually.

You will always find in me, dear Sir, the utmost inclination
to be of service to you; and let me beg that you will remember
your promise of writing to me.  As I am so much in town and in
the world, I flatter myself with having generally something to
tell you that may make my letters agreeable in the country:
you, any where, make yours charming.

Be so good to say any thing you think proper from me to your
sisters, and believe me, dear George, yours most sincerely.

(1041) Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Montagu, killed at the battle
of Fontenoy.



415 Letter 163
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 24, 1745.

I have no consequences of the battle of Tournay to tell you
but the taking of the town: the governor has eight days
allowed him to consider whether he will give up the citadel.
The French certainly lost more men than we did.  Our army is
still at Lessines waiting for recruits from Holland and
England; ours are sailed.  The King is at Hanover.  All the
letters are full of the Duke's humanity and bravery: he will
be as popular with the lower class of men as he has been for
three or four years with the low women: he will be the
soldier's Great Sir as well as theirs.  I am really glad; it
will be of great service to the family, if any one of them
come to make a figure.

Lord Chesterfield is returned from Holland; you will see a
most simple farewell speech of his in the papers.(1042)


I have received yours of the 4th of May, and am extremely
obliged to you for your expressions of kindness: they did not
at all surprise me, but every instance of your friendship
gives me pleasure.  I wish I could say the same to good prince
Craon.  Yet I must set about answering his letter: it is quite
an affair; I have so great a disuse of writing French, that I
believe it will be very barbarous.

My fears for Tuscany are again awakened: the wonderful march
Which the Spanish Queen has made Monsieur de Gage take, may
probably end in his turning short to the left; for his route
to Genoa will be full as difficult as what he has already
passed.  I watch eagerly every article from Italy, at a time
when nobody will read a paragraph but from the army in
Flanders.

I am diverted with my Lady's(1043) account of the great riches
that are now coming to her.  She has had so many foolish
golden visions, that I should think even the Florentines would
not be the dupes of any more.  As for her mourning, she may
save it, if she expects to have it notified.  Don't you
remember my Lady Pomfret's having a piece of economy of that
sort, when she would not know that the Emperor was dead,
because my Lord Chamberlain had not notified it to her.

I have a good story to tell you of Lord Bath, whose name you
have not heard very lately; have you? He owed a tradesman
eight hundred pounds, and would never pay him: the man
determined to persecute him till he did; and one morning
followed him to Lord Winchilsea's, and sent up word that he
wanted to speak with him.  Lord Bath came down, and said,
"Fellow, what do you want with me'!"-"My money," said the man,
as loud as ever he could bawl, before all the servants.  He
bade him come the next morning, and then would not see him.
The next Sunday the man followed him to church, and got into
the next pew: he leaned over, and said, , "My money; give me
my money!"  My lord went to the end of the pew; the man too:
"Give me my money!"  The sermon was on avarice, and the text,
"Cursed are they that heap up riches."  The man groaned out,
"O lord!" and pointed to my Lord Bath.  In short, he persisted
so much, and drew the eyes of all the congregation, that my
Lord Bath went out and paid him directly.  I assure you this
is a fact.  Adieu.

(1042) " Have you Lord Chesterfield's speech on taking leave?
It is quite calculated for the language it is wrote in, and
makes but an indifferent figure in English.  The thoughts are
common, and yet he strains hard to give them an air of
novelty; and the quaintness of the expression is quite a la
Fran`caise." The Hon.  P. Yorke to Horatio Walpole.-E.

(1043) Lady Walpole, now become Countess of Orford.-D.



416 Letter 164
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 25, 1745.

Dear George,
I don't write to you now so much to answer your letter as to
promote your diversion, which I am as much obliged to you for
consulting me about, at least as much as about an affair of
honour, or your marriage, or any other important transaction;
any one of which you might possibly dislike more than
diverting yourself.  For my part, I shall give you my advice
on this point with as much reflection as I should, if it were
necessary for me, like a true friend, to counsel you to
displease yourself.

You propose making a visit at Englefield Green, and ask me, if
I think it right? Extremely so.  I have heard it is a very
pretty place.  You love a jaunt--have a pretty chaise, I
believe, and, I dare swear, very easy; in all probability, you
have a fine evening too ; and, added to all this, the
gentleman you would go to see is very agreeable and good
humoured.(1044)  He has some very Pretty children, and a
sensible, learned man that lives with him, one Dr.
Thirlby,(1045) whom, I believe you know.  The master of the
house plays extremely well on the bass-viol, and has generally
other musical people with him.  He knows a good deal of the
private history of a late ministry; and, my dear George, you
love memoires.  Indeed, as to personal acquaintance with any
of the court beauties, I can't say you will find your account
in him ; but, to make amends, he is perfectly master of all
the quarrels that have been fashionably on foot about Handel,
and can give you a very perfect account of all the modern
rival painters.  In short, you may pass a very agreeable day
with him; and if he does but take to you, as I can't doubt,
who know you both, you will contract a great friendship with
him, which he will preserve with the greatest warmth and
partiality.

In short, I can think of no reason in the world against your
going there but one: do you know his youngest brother? If you
to be so unlucky, I can't flatter you so far as to advise you
to make him a visit; for there is nothing in the world the
Baron of Englefield has such an aversion for as for his
brother.

(1044) Mr. Walpole's brother, Sir Edward.  See Ant`e, p.189,
letter 42.

(1045) Styan Thirlby, fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge,
published an edition of Justin Martyr, and, I think, wrote
something against Middleton.  He communicated several notes to
Theobald for his Shakspeare, and in the latter part of his
life, took to study the common law.  He lived chiefly for his
last years with Sir Edward Walpole, who had procured for him a
small place in the Custom house, and to whom he left his
papers: he had lost his intellects some time before his death.
[He died a martyr to intemperance, in 1751, in his sixty-first
year.  Mr. Nichols says, that, while in Sir Edward's houses,
he kept a miscellaneous book of Memorables, containing
whatever was said or done amiss by Sir Edward, or any part of
his family.]



417 Letter 165
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Arlington Street, May 27, 1745.

My dear Harry,
As gloriously as you have set out, yet I despair of seeing you
a perfect hero! You have none of the charming violences that
are so essential to that character.  You write as coolly,
after behaving well in battle, as you fought in it.  Can your
friends flatter themselves with seeing you, one day or other,
be the death of thousands, when you wish for peace in three
weeks after four first engagements and laugh at the ambition
of those men who have given you this opportunity of
distinguishing yourself? With the person of an Orondates, and
the courage, you have all the compassion, the reason, and the
'reflection of one that never read a romance.  Can one ever
hope you will make a figure, when you only fight because it
was right you should, and not because you hated the French or
loved destroying mankind? This is so un-English, or so
un-heroic, that I despair of you!

Thank Heaven, you have one spice of madness! Your admiration
of your master(1047) leaves me a glimmering of hope, that you
will not be always so unreasonably reasonable.  Do you
remember the humorous lieutenant, in one of Beaumont and
Fletcher's plays, that is in love with the king? Indeed, your
master is not behindhand with you; you seem to have agreed to
puff one another.

If you are acting up to the strictest rules of war and
chivalry in Flanders, we are not less scrupulous on this side
the water in fulfilling all the duties of the same order.  The
day the young volunteer(1048 departed for the army (unluckily
indeed, it was after the battle), his tender mother
Sisygambis, and the beautiful Statira,(1049) a lady formerly
known in your history by the name of Artemisia, from her
cutting off her hair in your absence, were so afflicted and SO
inseparable, that they made a party together to Mr.
graham'S(1050) (you may read lapis if you please) to be
blooded.  It was settled that this was a more precious way of
expressing Concern than shaving the head, which has been known
to be attended with false locks the next day.

For the other princess you wot of, who is not entirely so tall
as the former, nor so evidently descended from a line of
monarchs--I don't hear her talk of retiring.  At present she
is employed in buying up all the nose-gays in Covent Garden
and laurel leaves at the pastry cooks, to where chaplets for
the return of her hero.  Who that is I don't pretend to know
or guess.  All I know is, that in this age retirement is not
one of the fashionable expressions of passion.

(1046) The battle of Fontenoy, where Mr. Conway greatly
distinguished himself.


(1047) The Duke of Cumberland, to whom Mr. Conway was
aide-de-camp.

(1048) George, afterwards Marquis Townshend.

(1049) Ethelreda Harrison, Viscountess Townshend, and her
daughter, the Hon.  Audrey Townshend, afterwards married to

you will endeavour to make as agreeable to him as possible.  I
beg you will introduce him to all my friends, who, I don't
doubt, will show him the same civilities that I received.
Dear Sir, this will be a particular obligation to me, who am,

419 Letter 167
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 24, 1745.

I have been a fortnight in the country, and had ordered all my
to be kept till I came to town, or I should have written to
you sooner about my sister-countess.  She is not arrived yet,
but is certainly coming: she has despatched several letters to
notify her intentions: a short one to her mother, saying,
"Dear Madam, as you have often desired me to return to
England, I am determined to set out, and hope you will give me
reasons to subscribe myself your most affectionate daughter."
This "often desired me to return" has never been repeated
since the first year of her going away.  The poor
signora-madre is in a terrible fright, and will not come to
town till her daughter is gone again, which all advices agree
will be soon.  Another letter is to my Lady Townshend, telling
her, "that, as she knows her ladyship's way of thinking, she
does not fear the continuance of her friendship." Another, a
long one, to my Lord Chesterfield; another to Lady Isabella
Scot,(1052) an old friend of hers; and another to Lady
Pomfret.  This last says, that she hears from guccioni, my
Lady O. will stay here a very little time, having taken a
house at Florence for three years.  She is to come to my Lady
Denbigh.(1053)  My brother is extremely obliged to you for all
your notices about her, though he is very indifferent about
her motions.  If she happens to choose law (though on what
foot no mortal can guess), he is prepared; having from the
first hint of her journey, fee'd every one of the considerable
lawyers.  In short, this jaunt is as simple as all the rest of
her actions have been hardy.  Nobody wonders at her bringing
no English servants with her-they know, and consequently might
tell too much.

I feel excessively for you, my dear child, on the loss of Mr.
Chute!--so sensible and so good-natured a man would be a loss
to any body; but to you, who are so meek and helpless, it is
irreparable! who will dry you when you are very wet
brown-paper?(1054)  Though I laugh, you know how much I pity
you: you will want somebody to talk over English letters, and
to conjecture with ),on; in short, I feel your distress in all
its lights.

The citadel of Tournay is gone;(1055) our affairs go ill.
Charles of Lorrain(1056) has lost a great battle grossly! He
was constantly drunk, and had no kind of intelligence.  Now he
acts from his own head, his head turns out a very bad one.  I
don't know, indeed, what they can say in defence of the great
general to whom we have just given the garter, the Duke of
Saxe Weissenfels; he is not of so serene a house but that he
might have known something of the motions of the Prussians.
Last night we heard that the Hungarian insurgents had cut to
pieces two  Prussian regiments.  The King of Prussia and
Prince Charles are so near, that we every day expect news of
another battle.  We don't know yet what is to be the next step
in Flanders.  Lord Cobham has got Churchill'S(1057) regiment,
and Lord Dunmore his government of Plymouth.  At the Prince's
court there is a great revolution; he, or rather Lord
Granville, or perhaps the Princess, (who, I firmly believe, by
all her quiet sense, will turn out a Caroline,) have at last
got rid of Lady Archibald,(1058) who was strongly attached to
the coalition.  They have civilly asked her, and Crossly
forced her to ask civilly to go away, which she has done, with
a pension of twelve hundred a-year.  Lady Middlesex,(1059) is
mistress of the robes: she lives with them perpetually, and
sits up till five in the morning at their suppers.  Don't
mistake!-not for her person, which is wondrous plain and
little: the town says it is for her friend Miss Granville, one
of the maids of honour; but at least yet, that is only
scandal.  She is a fair, red-haired girl, scarce pretty;
daughter of the poet, Lord Lansdown.(1060)  Lady Berkeley is
lady of the bedchamber, and Miss Lawson maid of honour.  Miss
Neville, a charming beauty, and daughter of the pretty,
unfortunate Lady Abergavenny,(1061) is named for the next
vacancy.

I was scarcely settled in my joy for the Spaniards having
taken the opposite route to Tuscany, when I heard of Mr.
Chute's leaving you.  I long to have no reason to be uneasy
about you.  I am obliged to you for the gesse figures, and beg
you will send me the bill in your first letter.  Rysbrach has
perfectly mended the Ganymede and the model, which to me
seemed irrecoverably smashed.

I have just been giving a recommendatory letter for you to Mr.
Hobart; he is a particular friend of mine, but is Norfolk, and
in the world; so you will be civil to him. He is of the
Damon-kind, and not one of whom you will make a Chute.  madame

421 Letter 168
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, June 25, 1745.

Dear George,
I have been near three weeks in Essex, at Mr. Rigby's,(1062)
and had left your direction behind me, and could not write to
you.  It is the charmingest place by nature, and the most
trumpery by art, that ever I saw.  The house stands on a high
hill, on an arm of the sea, which winds itself before two
sides of the house.  On the right and left, at the very foot
of this hill, lie two towns; the one of market quality, and
the other with a wharf where ships come up.  This last was to
have a church, but by a lucky want of religion in the
inhabitants, who would not contribute to building a steeple,
it remains an absolute antique temple, with a portico on the
very strand.  Cross this arm of the sea, you see six churches
and charming woody hills in Suffolk.  All this parent Nature
did for this place; but its godfathers and godmothers, I
believe, promised it should renounce all the pomps and
vanities of this world, for they have patched up a square
house, full of windows, low rooms, and thin walls; piled up
walls wherever there was a glimpse of prospect; planted
avenues that go nowhere, and dug fishponds where there should
be avenues.  We had very bad weather the whole time I was
there! but however I rode about and sailed, not having the
same apprehensions Of catching cold that Mrs.
Kerwood had once at Chelsea, when I persuaded her not to go
home by water, because it would be damp after rain.

The town is not quite empty yet.  My Lady Fitzwatter, Lady
Betty Germain,(1063) Lady Granville,(1064) and the dowager
Strafford have their At-homes, and amass company.  Lady Brown
has done with her Sundays, for she is changing her house into
Upper Brook Street.  In the mean time, she goes to
Knightbridge, and Sir Robert to the woman he keeps at
Scarborough: Winnington goes on with the Frasi; so my lady
Townshend is obliged only to lie of people.  You have heard of
the disgrace of the Archibald, and that in future scandal she
must only be ranked with the Lady Elizabeth Lucy and Madam
Lucy Walters, instead of being historically noble among the
Clevelands, Portsmouths, and Yarmouths.  It is said Miss
Granville has the reversion of her coronet;
 others say, she won't accept the patent.

Your friend Jemmy Lumley,(1065)--beg pardon, I mean your kin,
is not he? I am sure he is not your friend;--well, he has had
an assembly, and he would write all the cards himself, and
every one of them was to desire he's company and she's
company, with other pieces of curious orthography.  Adieu,
dear George!  I wish you a merry farm, as the children say at
Vauxhall.  My compliments to your sisters.

422 Letter 169
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Arlington Street, July 1, 1745.

My dear harry,
If it were not for that one slight inconvenience, that I
should probably be dead now, I should have liked much better
to have lived in the last war than in this; I mean as to the
pleasantness of writing letters.  Two or three battles won,
two or three towns taken, in a summer, were pretty objects to
keep up the liveliness of a correspondence.  But now it hurts
one's dignity to be talking of English and French armies, at
the first period of our history in which the tables are
turned.  After having learnt to spell out of the reigns of
Edward the Third and Harry the Fifth, and begun lisping with
Agincourt and Cressy, one uses one's self but awkwardly to the
sounds of Tournay and Fontenoy.  I don't like foreseeing the
time so near, when all the young orators in Parliament will be
haranguing out of Demosthenes upon the imminent danger we are
in from the overgrown power of King Philip.  As becoming as
all that public spirit will be, which to be sure will now come
forth, I can't but think we were at least as happy and as
great when all the young Pitts and Lytteltons were pelting
oratory at my father for rolling out a twenty years' peace,
and not envying the trophies which he passed by every day in
Westminster Hall.  But one must not repine; rather reflect on
the glories which they have drove the nation headlong into.
One must think all our distresses and dangers well laid out,
when they have purchased us Glover'S(1066) Oration for the
merchants, the Admiralty for the Duke of Bedford, and the
reversion of Secretary at war for Pitt, which he will
certainly have, unless the French King should happen to have
the nomination; and then I fear, as much obliged as that court
is to my Lord Cobham and his nephews, they would be so partial
as to prefer some illiterate nephew of Cardinal Tencin's, who
never heard of Leonidas or the Hanover troops.

With all these reflections, as I love to make myself easy,
especially politically, I comfort myself with what St.
Evremond (a favourite philosopher of mine, for he thought what
he liked, not liked what he thought) said in defence of
Cardinal Mazarin, when he was reproached with neglecting the
good of the kingdom that he might engross the riches of it:
"Well, let him get all the riches, and then he will think of
the good of the kingdom, for it will all be his own." Let the
French but have England, and they won't want to conquer it.
We may possibly contract the French spirit of being supremely
content with the glory of our monarch, and then-why then it
will be the first time we ever -were contented yet.  We hear
of nothing but your retiring,(1067 and of Dutch treachery: in
short, 'tis an holy scene!

I know of no home news but the commencement of the gaming
act,(1068) for which they are to put up a scutcheon at
White's--for the death of play; and the death of Winnington's
wife, which may be an unlucky event for my Lady Townshend.  As
he has no children, he will certainly marry again; and who
will give him their daughter, unless he breaks off that
affair, which I believe he will now very willingly make a
marriage article? We want him to take Lady -Charlotte Fermor.
She was always his beauty, and has so many charming qualities,
that she would make any body happy.  He will make a good
husband; for he is excessively good-natured, and was much
better to that strange wife than he cared to own.

You wondered at my journey to Houghton; now -wonder more, for
I am going to Mount Edgecumbe.  Now my summers are in my own
hands, and I am not obliged to pass great part of them in
Norfolk, I find it is not so very terrible to dispose of them
up and down. In about three weeks I shall set out, and see
Wilton and Doddington's in my way.  Dear Harry, do but get a
victory, and I will let off every cannon at Plymouth:
reserving two, till I hear particularly that you have killed
two more Frenchmen with your own hand.(1069) Lady Mary(1070)
sends you her compliments; she is going to pass a week with
Miss Townshend(1071) at Muffits; I don't think you will be
forgot.  Your sister Anne has got a new distemper, which she
says feels like something jumping in her.  You know my style
on such an occasion, and may be sure I have not spared this
distemper.  Adieu! Yours ever.

424 Letter 170
To sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, July 5, 1745.

All yesterday we were in the utmost consternation an express
came the night before from Ostend with an account of the
French army in Flanders having seized Ghent and Bruges, cut
off a detachment of four thousand men, surrounded our army,
who must be cut to pieces or surrender themselves prisoners,
and that the Duke was gone to the Hague, but that the Dutch
had signed a neutrality.  You will allow that here was ample
subject for confusion!  To-day we are a little relieved, by
finding that we have lost but five hundred men(1072) instead
of four thousand, and that our army, which is inferior by half
to theirs, is safe behind a river.  With this came the news of
the Great Duke's victory over the Prince of Conti:(1073) he
has killed fifteen thousand, and taken six thousand prisoners.
Here is already a third great battle this summer! But Flanders
is gone! The Dutch have given up all that could hinder the
French from overrunning them, upon condition that the French
should not overrun them.  Indeed, I cannot be so exasperated
at the Dutch as it is the fashion to be; they have not forgot
the peace of Utrecht, though we have.  Besides, how could they
rely on any negotiation with a people whose politics alter so
often as ours? Or why were we to fancy that my Lord
Chesterfield's parts would have more weight than my uncle had,
whom, ridiculous as he was, they had never known to take a
trip to Avignon to confer with the Duke of Ormond?(1074)

Our communication with the army is cut off through Flanders
and we are in great pain for Ostend: the fortifications are
all out of repair.  Upon Marshal Wade's reiterated
remonstrances, we did cast thirty cannon and four mortars for
it-and then the economic ministry would not send them. "What!
fortify the Queen of Hungary's towns? there will be no end of
that."  As if Ostend was of no more consequence to us, than
Mons or Namur! Two more battalions are ordered over
immediately; and the old pensioners of Chelsea College are to
mount guard at home! Flourishing in a peace of twenty years,
we were told that we were trampled upon by Spain and France.
Haughty nations, like those, who can trample upon an enemy
country, do not use to leave it in such wealth and happiness
as we enjoyed; but when the Duke of Marlborough's old
victorious veterans are dug out of their colleges and repose,
to guard the King's palace, and to keep up the show of an army
which we have buried in America, or in a manner lost in
Flanders, we shall soon know the real feel of being trampled
upon! In this crisis, you will hear often from me; for I will
leave you in no anxious uncertainty from which I can free you.

The Countess(1075) is at Hanover, and, we hear, extremely well
received.  It is conjectured, and it is not impossible, that
the Count may have procured for her some dirty dab of a
negotiation about some 'acre of territory more for Hanover, in
order to facilitate her reception.  She has been at Hesse
Cassel, and fondled extremely Princess Mary'S(1076) children;
just as you know she used to make a rout about the Pretender's
boys.  My Lord Chesterfield laughs at her letter to him; and,
what would anger her more than the neglect, ridicules the
style and orthography.  Nothing promises well for her here.

You told me you wished I would condole with Prince Craon on
the death of his son:(1077) which son? and where was he
killed?  You don't tell me, and I never heard.  Now it would
be too late.  I should have been uneasy for Prince Beauvau,
but that you say he is in Piedmont.

Adieu! my dear child: we have much to wish! A little good
fortune will not re-establish us.  I am in pain for your
health from the great increase of your business.

(1072 The French had been successful in a skirmish against the
English army, at a place called Melle.  The consequence of
this success was their obtaining the possession of Ghent.-D.

(1073) The army of the Prince of Conti, posted near the Maine,
had been so weakened by the detachments sent from it to
reinforce the army in Flanders, that it was obliged to retreat
before the Austrians.  This retrograde movement was effected
with considerable loss, both of soldiers and baggage; but it
does not appear that any decisive general engagement took
place during the campaign between the French and Austrians.-D.

425 Letter 171
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 12, 1745.

I am charmed with the sentiments that Mr. Chute expresses for
you; but then you have lost him! Here is an answer to his
letter; I send it unsealed, to avoid repealing what I have
thought on our affairs.  Seal it and send it.  Its being open,
prevented my saying half so much about you as I should have
done.

There is no more news - the Great Duke's victory, of which we
heard so much last week, is come to nothing! So far from
having defeated the Prince of Conti, it is not at all
impossible but the Prince may wear the imperial coat of
diamonds, though I am persuaded the care of that will be the
chief concern of the Great Duke, (next to his own person,) in
a battle.  Our army is retreated beyond Brussels; the French
gather laurels, and towns, and prisoners, as one would a
nosegay.  In the mean time you are bullying the King of
Naples, in the person of the English fleet; and I think may
possibly be doing so for two months after that very fleet
belongs to the King of France; as astrologers tell one that we
should see stars shine for I don't know how long after they
were annihilated.  But I like your spirit; keep it up!
Millamant, in the Way of the World, tells Mirabel, that she
will be solicited to the very last; nay, and afterwards. He
replies, "What! after the last?"

I am in great pain about your arrears; it is a bad season for
obtaining payment.  In the best times, they make a custom of
paying foreign ministers Ill; which may be very politic, when
they send men of too great fortunes abroad in order to lessen
them: but, my dear child, God knows that is not your case!

I have some extremely pretty dogs of King Charles's breed, if
I knew how to convey them to you: indeed they are not
Patapans.  I can't tell how they would like travelling into
Italy, when there is a prospect of the rest of their race
returning from thence: besides, you must certify me that none
of them shall ever be married below themselves; for since the
affair of Lady Caroline Fox, one durst not hazard the Duke of
Richmond's resentment even about a dog and bitch of that
breed.

Lord Lempster(1078) is taken prisoner in the affair of the
detachment to Ghent.  My lady,(1079) who has heard of Spartan
mothers, (though you know she once asserted that nobody knew
any thing of the Grecian Republics,) affects to bear it with a
patriot insensibility.  She told me the other day that the
Abb`e Niccolini and the eldest Pandolfini are coming to
England: is it true? I shall be very Clad to be civil to them,
especially to the latter, who, you know, was one of my
friends.

My Lady Orford is at Hanover, most Graciously received by "the
Father of all his people!" In the papers of yesterday was this
paragraph; "Lady O. who has spent several years in Italy,
arrived here (Hanover) the 3d, on her return to England, and
was Graciously received by his Majesty." Lady Denbigh is gone
into the country so I don't know where she is to lodge-perhaps
at St. James's, out of' regard to my father's memory.

Trust me, you escaped well in Pigwiggin's(1079) not accepting
your invitation of living with you: you must have aired your
house, as Lady Pomfret was forced to air Lady Mary Wortley's
bedchamber.  He has a most unfortunate breath: so has the
Princess his sister.  When I was at their country-house, I
used to sit in the library and turn over books of prints: out
of good breeding they would not quit me; nay, would look over
the prints with me.  A whiff would come from the east, and I
turned short to the west, whence the Princess would puff me
back with another gale full as richly perfumed as her
brother's.  Adieu!

became second Earl of Pomfret.  He died in 1785.-E.

427 Letter 172
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, July 13, 1745.

Dear George,
We are all Cabob'd and Cocofagoed, as my Lord Denbigh says.
We, who formerly, you know, could any one of us beat three
Frenchmen, are now so .degenerated, that three Frenchmen(1081)
can evidently beat One Englishman.  Our army is running away,
all that is left to run; for half of it is picked up by three
or four hundred at a time. In short, we must step out of the
high pantoufles that were made by those cunning shoemakers at
Poitiers and Ramilies, and go clumping about perhaps in wooden
ones.  My Lady Hervey, who you know dotes upon every thing
French, is charmed with the hopes of these new shoes, and has
already bespoke herself a pair of pigeon wood.  How did the
tapestry at Blenheim look? Did it glow with victory, or did
all our glories look overcast?

I remember a very admired sentence in one of my Lord
Chesterfield's speeches, when he was haranguing for this war;
with a most rhetorical transition, he turned to the tapestry
in the House of Lords,(1082) and said, with a sigh, he feared
there were no historical looms at work now! Indeed, we have
reason to bless the good patriots, who have been for employing
our manufactures so historically.  The Countess of that wise
Earl, with whose two expressive words I began this letter,
says, she is very happy now that my lord had never a place
upon the coalition, for then all this bad situation of our
affairs would have been laid upon him.

Now I have been talking of remarkable periods in our annals, I
must tell you what my Lord Baltimore thinks one:--He said to
the Prince t'other day, "Sir, your Royal Highness's marriage
will be an area in English history."

If it were not for the life that is put into the town now and
then by very bad news from abroad, one should be quite
stupefied.  There is nobody left but two or three solitary
regents; and they are always whisking backwards and forwards
to their villas; and about a dozen antediluvian dowagers,
whose carcasses have miraculously resisted the wet, and who
every Saturday compose a very reverend catacomb at my old Lady
Strafford's.  She does not take money at the door for showing
them, but 'you pay twelvepence apiece under the denomination
of card-money.  Wit and beauty, indeed, remain in the persons
of Lady Townshend and Lady Caroline Fitzroy; but such is the
want of taste of this age, that the former is very often
forced to wrap up her wit in plain English before it can be
understood; and the latter is almost as often obliged to have
recourse to the same artifices to make her charms be taken
notice of.

Of beauty, I can tell you an admirable story.  One Mrs.
Comyns, an elderly gentlewoman, has lately taken a house in
St. James's Street: some young gentlemen went there t'other
night;--"Well, Mrs. Comyns, I hope there won't be the same
disturbances here that were at your other house in Air
Street."--"Lord, Sir, I never had any disturbances there: mine
was as quiet a house as any in the neighbourhood, and a great
deal of company came to me: it was only the ladies of quality
that envied Me."--"Envied you! why, your house was pulled down
about your ears."--"Oh, dear Sir! don't you know how that
happened?"--"No; pray how?"--"Why, dear Sir, it was my Lady
**** who gave ten guineas to the mob to demolish my house,
because her ladyship fancied I got women for Colonel Conway."

My dear George, don't you delight in this story? If poor
Harry(1083) comes back from Flanders, I intend to have
infinite fun with his prudery about this anecdote, which is
full as good as if it was true.  I beg you will visit Mrs.
Comyns when you come to town- she has infinite humour.

428 Letter 173
To Sir Horace Mann.
July 15, 1745.

You will be surprised at another from me so soon, when I wrote
to you but four days ago.  This is not with any news, but upon
a private affair.  You have never said any thing to Me about
the extraordinary procedure of Marquis Riccardi, of which I
wrote you word.  Indeed, as his letter came just upon my
father's death, I had forgot it too; so much so, that I have
lost the catalogue which he sent me. Well, the other day I
received his cargo.  Now, My dear child, I don't write to him
upon it, because, as he Sent the things without asking my
leave, I am determined never to acknowledge the receipt of
them because I will in no manner be liable to pay for them if
they are lost: which I think highly probable; and as I have
lost the catalogue, I cannot tell whether I have received all
or not.

I beg you will just say what follows to him.  That I am
extremely amazed he should think of employing me to sell his
goods for him, especially without asking my consent, that an
English gentleman, just come from France, has brought me a box
of things, of which he himself had no account; nor is there
any letter or catalogue with them; that I suppose they may be
the Marquis's collection: I have lost the catalogue, and
consequently cannot tell whether I have received all or not,
nor whether they are his: that as they came in so blind a
manner, and have been opened at several custom-houses, I will
not be answerable especially having never given my consent to
receive them, and having opened the box ignorantly, without
knowing the contents: that when I did open it, I concluded it
came from Florence, having often refused to buy most of the
things, which had long lain upon the jeweller's hands on the
old bridge, and which are very improper for sale here, as all
the English for some years have seen them, and not thought
them worth purchasing - that I remember in the catalogue the
price for the whole was fixed at two thousand pistoles; that
they are full as much worth two-and-twenty thousand; and that
I have been laughed at by people to whom I have showed them
for naming so extravagant a price: that nobody living would
think of buying all together: that for myself, I have entirely
left off making any collection; and if I had not, would not
buy things dear now which I have formerly refused at much
lower prices.  That, after all, though I cannot think myself
at all well used by Marquis Riccardi, either in sending me the
things, in the price he has fixed on them, or in the things
themselves, which to my knowledge he has picked up from the
shops on the old bridge, and were no family collection, yet,
as I received so many civilities at Florence from the
nobility, and in particular from his wife, Madame Riccardi, if
he will let me do any thing that is practicable, I will sell
what I can for him. That if he will send me A new and distinct
catalogue, with the price of each piece, and a price
considerably less than what he has set upon the whole, I will
endeavour to dispose of what I can for him.  But as most of
them are very indifferent, and the total value most
unreasonable, I absolutely will not undertake the sale of them
upon any other terms, but will pack them up, and send them
away to Leghorn by the first ship that sails; for as we are at
war with France, I cannot send them that way, nor will I
trouble any gentleman to carry them, as he might think himself
liable to make them good if they met with any accident; nor
will I answer for them by whatever way they go, as I did not
consent to receive them, nor am sure that I have received the
Marquis's collection.

My dear Sir, translate this very distinctly for him, for he
never shall receive any other notice from me; nor will I give
them up to Wasner or Pucci,(1084) or any body else, though he
should send me an order for it; for nobody saw me open them,
nor shall any body be able to say I had them, by receiving
them from me.  In short, I think I cannot be too cautious in
such a negotiation.  If a man will send Me things to the value
of two thousand pistoles, whether they are really worth it or
not, he shall take his chance for losing them, and shall
certainly never come upon me for them.  He must absolutely
take his choice, of selling them at a proper price and
separately, or of having them directly sent back by sea; for
whether he consents to either or not, I shall certainly
proceed in my resolution about them
the very instant I receive an answer from you; for the sooner
I am clear of them the better.  If he will let me sell them
without setting a price, he may depend upon my taking the best
method for his service; though really, my dear child, it will
be for my own honour, not for his sake, who has treated me so
impertinently.  I am sorry to give you this trouble, but judge
how much the fool gives me!  Adieu!

(1084) Ministers of the Queen of Hungary and the Great Duke.




430 Letter 174
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 26, 1745.

It is a pain to me to write to you, when all I can tell you
will but distress you.  How much I wish myself with you!
anywhere, where I should have my thoughts detached in some
degree by distance and by length of time from England! With
all the reasons that I have for not loving great part of it,
it is impossible not to feel the shock of living at the period
of all its greatness! to be one of the Ultimi Romanorum! I
will not proceed upon the chapter of reflections, but mention
some facts, which will supply your thoughts with all I should
say.

The French make no secret of their intending to come hither;
the letters from Holland speak of it as a notoriety.  Their
Mediterranean fleet is come to Rochfort, and they have another
at Brest.  Their immediate design is to attack our army, the
very lessening which will be victory for them.  Our six
hundred men, which have lain cooped up in the river till they
had contracted diseases, are at last gone to Ostend.  Of all
this our notable ministry still make a secret: one cannot
learn the least particulars from them.  This anxiety for my
friends in the army, this uncertainty about ourselves, if it
can be called uncertain that we are undone, and the provoking
folly that one sees prevail, have determined me to go to the
Hague.  I shall at least hear sooner from the army, and shall
there know better what is likely to happen here.  The moment
the crisis is come I shall return hither, which I can do from
Helvoetsluys in twelve hours.  At all events, I shall
certainly not stay there above a month or six weeks: it
thickens too fast for something important not to happen by
that time.

You may judge of our situation by the conversation of Marshal
Belleisle: he has said for some time, that he saw we were so
little capable of making any defence that he would engage,
with five thousand scullions of the French army, to conquer
England--yet, just now, they choose to release him! he goes
away in a week.(1085)  When he was told of the taking Cape
Breton, he said. "he could believe that, because the ministry
had no hand in it." We are making bonfires for Cape Breton,
and thundering over Genoa, while our army in Flanders is
running away, and dropping to pieces by detachments taken
prisoners every day; while the King is at Hanover, the regency
at their country-seats, not five thousand men in the island,
and not above fourteen or fifteen ships at home! Allelujah!

I received yours yesterday, with the bill of lading for the
gesse figures, but you don't tell me their price; pray do in
your 'next.  I don't know what to say to Mr. Chute's eagle; I
would fain have it; I can depend upon his taste-but would not
it be folly to be buying curiosities now! how can I tell that
I shall have any thing in the world to pay for it, by the time
it is bought? You may present these reasons to Mr. Chute; and
if he laughs at them, why then he will buy the eagle for me;
if he thinks them of weight, not.

Adieu! I have not time or patience to say more.

(1085) The Marshal and his brother left England on the 13th of
August.-E.



431 Letter 175
To George Montagu, Esq.
[August 1, 1745.]

Dear George,
I cannot help thinking you laugh at me when you say such very
civil things of my letters, and yet, coming from you, I would
fain not have it all flattery:

So much the more, as, from a little elf,
I've had a high opinion of myself,
Though sickly, slender, and not large of limb.

With this modest prepossession, you may be sure I like to have
you commend me, whom, after I have done with myself, I admire
of all men living.  I only beg that you will commend me no
more: it is very ruinous; and praise, like other debts, ceases
to be due on being paid.  One comfort indeed is, that it is as
seldom paid as other debts.

I have been very fortunate lately: I have met with an extreme
good print of M. de Grignan;(1086) I am persuaded, very like;
and then it has his toufie `ebouriff`ee; I don't, indeed, know
what that was, but I am sure it Is in the-print.  None of the
critics could ever make out what Livy's Patavinity is though
they are confident it is in his writings.  I have heard within
these few days, what, for your sake, I wish I could have told
you sooner-that there is in Belleisle's suite the Abb`e
Perrin, who published Madame S`evign`e's letters, and who has
the originals in his hands.  How one should have liked to have
known him! The Marshal was privately in london last Friday.
He is entertained to-day at Hampton Court by the Duke of
Grafton.(1087)  Don't you believe it was to settle the binding
the scarlet thread in the window, when the French shall come
in unto the land to possess it?  I don't at all wonder at any
shrewd observations the Marshal has made on our situation.
The bringing him here at all--the sending him away now--in
short, the whole series of our conduct convinces me that, we
shall soon see as silent a change as that in the Rehearsal, of
King Usher and King Physician.  It may well be so, when the
disposition of the drama is in the hands of the Duke of
Newcastle--those hands that are always groping and sprawling,
and fluttering and hurrying on the rest of his precipitate
person.  But there is no describing him, but as M. Courcelle,
a French prisoner, did t'other day: "Je ne scais pas," dit il,
"je ne scaurois m'exprimer, mais il a un certain tatillonage." If
one could conceive a dead body hung in chains, always wanting to
be hung somewhere else, one should have a comparative idea of
him.

For my own part, I comfort myself with the humane reflection
of the Irishman in the ship that was on fire--I am but a
passenger!  if I were not so indolent, I think I should rather
put in practice the late Duchess of Bolton's(1088)
geographical resolution of going to China, when Winston told
her the world would be burnt in three years.  Have you any
philosophy? Tell me what you think.  It is quite the fashion
to talk of the French coming here.  Nobody sees it in any
other light but as a thing to be talked of, not to be
precautioned against.  Don't you remember a report of the
plague being in the
city, and every body went to the house where it was to see it?
You- see I laugh about it, for I would not for the world be so
unenglished as to do otherwise.  I am persuaded that when
Count Saxe, with ten thousand men, is within a day's march of
London, people will be hiring windows at Charing-cross and
Cheapside to see them pass by.  'Tis our characteristic to take
dangers for sights, and evils for curiosities.

Adieu! dear George: I am laying in scraps of Cato against it
may be necessary to take leave of one's correspondents `a la
Romaine, and, before the play itself is suppressed by a lettre
de cachet to the booksellers.

P. S. Lord! 'tis the 1st of August, 1745, a holiday(1089) that
is going to be turned out of the almanack!

(1086) Fran`cois-Adh`emar de Monteil, Comte de Grignan,
Lieutenant-general of Provence.  He married, in 1669, the
daughter of Madame de S`evign`e-E.

Newcastle, at Clermont.-E.

432 Letter 176
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Aug. 7, 1745.

I have no news to tell you: Ostend is besieged, and must be
gone in a few days.  The Regency are all come to town to
prevent an invasion--I should as soon think them able to make
one--not but old Stair, who still exists upon the embers of an
absurd fire that warmed him ninety years ago, thinks it still
practicable to march to Paris, and the other day in council
prevented a resolution of sending for our army home; but as we
always do half of a thing, when even the whole would scarce
signify, they seem determined to send for ten thousand--the
other ten will remain in Flanders, to keep up the bad figure
that we have been making there all this summer.  Count Saxe
has been three times tapped since the of Fontenoy: but if we
get rid of his enmity, there is Belleisle gone, amply to supply
and succeed to his hatred!  Van Hoey, the ingenious Dutchman at
Paris, wrote to the States to know if he should make new liveries
against the rejoiCings for the French conquests in Flanders.  I
love the governor of SLuys; when the States sent him a reprimand,
for not admitting our troops that retreated thither from the
affair of Ghent, asking him if he did not know that he ought to
admit their allies? he replied, "Yes; and would they have him
admit the French too as their allies?"

There is a proclamation come out for apprehending the
Pretender's son;(1090) he was undoubtedly on board the frigate
attendant on the Elizabeth, with which Captain Brett fought so
bravely:(1090) the boy is now said to be at Brest.

I have put off my journey to the Hague, as the sea is full of
ships, and many French ones about the siege of
Ostend: I go tomorrow to Mount Edgecumbe.  I don't think it
impossible but you may receive a letter from me on the road,
with a paragraph like that in Cibber's life, "Here I met the
revolution."

My lady Orford is set out for Hanover; her gracious sovereign
does not seem inclined to leave it.  Mrs. Chute(1092) has sent
me this letter, which you will be so good as to send to Rome.
We have taken infinite riches; vast wealth in the East Indies,
vast from the West; in short, we grow so fat that we shall
very soon be fit to kill.

Your brother has this moment brought me a letter from you,
full of your good-natured concern for the Genoese.  I have not
time to write you any thing but short paragraphs, as I am in
the act of writing all my letters and doing my business before
my journey.  I can say no more now about the affair of your
secretary.  Poor Mrs. Gibberne has been here this morning
almost in fits about her son.  She brought me a long letter to
you, but I absolutely prevented her sending it, and told her I
would let you know that it was my fault if you don't hear from
her, but that I would take the answer upon myself.  My dear
Sir, for her sake, for the silly boy's, who is ruined if he
follows his own whims, and for your own sake, who will have so
much trouble to get and form another, I must try to prevent
your parting.  I am persuaded, that neither the fatigue of
writing, nor the indignation of going to sea are the boy's
true motives.  They are, the smallness of his allowance, and
his aversion to waiting it table, For the
first, the poor woman does not expect that you should put
yourself to any inconvenience; she only begs that you will be
so good as to pay him twenty pounds a-year more, which she
herself will repay to your brother; and not let her son know
that it comes from her, as he would then refuse to take it.
For the other point, I must tell you, my dear child, fairly,
that in goodness to the poor boy, I hope you will give it up.
He is to make his fortune in your way of life, if he can be so
lucky, It will be an insuperable obstacle to him that he is
with you in the light of a menial servant.  When you reflect
that his fortune may depend upon it, I am sure you will free
him from this servitude, Your brother and I, you know, from
the very first, thought that you should not insist upon it.
If he will stay with you on the terms I propose, I am sure,
from the trouble it will save yourself, and the ruin from
which it will save him, you will yield to this request; which
I seriously make to you, and advise you to comply with.
Adieu!

(1090) The proclamation was dated the 1st of August, and
offered a reward of thirty thousand pounds for the young
Prince's apprehension.  He left the island of Belleisle on the
13th of July, disguised in the habit of a Student of the Scots
college at Paris, and allowing his beard to grow.-E.

(1091) Captain Brett was the same officer who, in Anson's
expedition, had stormed Paita.  His ship was called the Lion.
After a well-matched fight of five or six hours, the vessels
parted, each nearly disabled.-E.

(1092) Widow of Francis Chute, Esq.



            434 Letter 177
To The Rev. Thomas Birch.(1093)
Woolterton 15th [Aug.] 1745

When I was lately in town I was favoured with yours of the
21st past; but my stay there was so short, and my hurry so
great, that I had not time to see you as I intended.  As I am
persuaded that nobody is more capable than yourself, in all
respects, to set his late Majesty's reign in a true light, I
am sure there is nobody to whom I would more readily give my
assistance, as far as I am able: but, as I have never wrote
any thing in a historical way, have now and then suggested
hints to others as they were writing, and never published but
two pamphlets-one was to justify the taking and keeping in our
pay the twelve thousand Hessians, of which I have forgot the
title, and have it not in the country; the other was published
about two years since, entitled, "The Interest of Great
Britain steadily Pursued," in answer to the pamphlets about
the Hanover forces-I can't tell in what manner, nor on what
heads to answer your desire, which is conceived in such
general terms: if you could point out some stated times, and
some particular facts, and I had before me a sketch of your
narration, I perhaps might be able, to suggest or explain some
things that are come but imperfectly to your knowledge, and
some anecdotes might occur to my memory relating to domestic
and foreign affairs, that are curious, and were never yet made
public, and perhaps not proper to, be published yet;
particularly with regard to the alteration of the ministry in
1717, by the removal of my relation, and the measures that
were pursued in consequence of that alteration; but in order
to do this, or any thing else for your service, requires a
personal conversation with you, in which I should be ready to
let you know what might occur to me.  I am most truly, etc.

(1093) This industrious historian and biographer was born in
1705, and was killed by a fall from his horse, in 1765.  Dr.
Johnson said of him, "Tom Birch is as brisk as a bee in
conversation; but no sooner does he take a pen in his hand,
than it becomes a torpedo to him, and benumbs all his
faculties.--E.



435 Letter 178
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Sept. 6, 1745.

It would have been inexcusable in me, in our present
circumstances and after all I have promised you, not to have
written to you for this last month, if I had been in London;
but I have been at Mount Edgecumbe, and so constantly upon the
road, that I neither received your letters, had time to write,
or knew what to write. I came back last night, and found three
packets from you, which I have no time to answer, and but just
time to read.  The confusion I have found, and the danger we
are in, prevent my talking of any thing else.  The young
Pretender(1094) at the head of three thousand men, has got a
march on General Cope, who is not eighteen hundred strong: and
when the last accounts came away, was fifty miles nearer
Edinburgh than Cope, and by this time is there.  The clans
will not rise for the Government: the Dukes of Argyll(1095)
and Athol,(1096) are come post to town,(1097) not having been
able to raise a man.  The young Duke of Gordon(1098) sent for
his uncle and told him that he must arm their clan.  "They are
in arms."--"They must march against the rebels."--"They will
wait on the Prince of Wales." The Duke flew in a passion; his
uncle pulled out a pistol, and told him
it was in vain to dispute.  Lord Loudon,(1099) Lord
Fortrose(1100) and Lord Panmure,(1101) have been very zealous,
and have raised some men; but I look upon Scotland as gone!  I
think of what King William said to the Duke of Hamilton, when
he was extolling Scotland: "My Lord, I only wish it
was a hundred thousand miles off, and that you was king of
it!"

There are two manifestos published signed Charles
Prince, Regent for his father, King of Scotland, England,
France, and Ireland.  By One, he promises to preserve every
body in their just rights; and orders all persons who have
public moneys in their hands to bring it to him; and by the
other dissolves the union between England and Scotland.  But
all this is not the worst!  Notice came yesterday, that there
are ten thousand men, thirty transports, and ten men-of-war at
Dunkirk.  Against this force we have--I don't know what--
scarce fears! Three thousand Dutch -we hope are by this time
landed In Scotland; three more are coming hither.  We have
sent for ten regiments from Flanders, which may be here in a
week, and we have fifteen men-of-war in the Downs.  I am
grieved to tell you all this; but when it is so, how can I
avoid telling you?  Your brother is just come in, who says he
has written to you-I have not time to expatiate.

My Lady O. is arrived; I hear she says, only to endeavour to
get a certain allowance.  Her mother has sent to offer her the
use of her house.  She is a poor weak woman.  I can say
nothing to Marquis Riccardi, nor think of him; only tell him,
that I will when I have time. My sister(1102) has married
herself, that is, declared she will, to young Churchill.  It
is a foolish match; but I have nothing to do with it.  Adieu!
my dear Sir; excuse my haste, but you must imagine that one is
not much at leisure to write long letters--hope if you can!

(1094) The 'Pretender had landed, with a few followers, in the
Highlands Of Scotland, on the 25th of July.  His appearance at
this time is thus described by Mr. Eneas Macdonald, one of his
attendants: "There entered the tent a tall youth, of a most
agreeable aspect, in a plain black coat, with a plain shirt
not very clean, and a cambric stock, fixed with a plain silver
buckle, a plain hat with a canvass string, having one end
fixed to one of his coat buttons. he had black stockings and
brass buckles in his shoes.  At his first appearance I found
my heart swell to my very throat, but we were immediately
told, that this youth was an English clergyman, who had long
been possessed with a desire to see and converse with
Highlanders." "It is remarkable,"
observes Lord Mahon, " that among the foremost to join
Charles, was the father of Marshal Macdonald, Duke de Tarento,
long after raised to these honours by his merit in the French
revolutionary wars, and not more distinguished for courage and
capacity than for integrity and honour." Hist. vol. iii. p.
344.-E.

succeeded upon the death of his father in 1724, in consequence
of the attainder of his elder brother, William, Marquis of

(1097) This was not true of the Duke of Argyll; for he did not
attempt to raise any men, but pleaded a Scotch act of
parliament against arming without authority.

436 Letter 179
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Sept. 13, 1745.

The rebellion goes on; but hitherto there is no rising in
England, nor landing of troops from abroad; indeed not even of
ours or the Dutch.  The best account I can give you is, that
if the Boy has apparently no enemies in Scotland, at least he
has openly very few friends.  Nobody of note has joined him,
but a brother of the Duke of Athol,(1103) and another of Lord
Dunmore.(1104)  For cannon, they have nothing but
one-pounders: their greatest resource is money; they have
force Louis-d'ors.  The last accounts left them at Perth,
making shoes and stockings.  It is certain that a sergeant of
Cope's with twelve men, put to flight two hundred, on killing
only six or seven.  Two hundred of the Monroe clan have joined
our forces.  Spirit seems to rise in London, though not in the
proportion it ought; and then the person(1105) most concerned
does every thing to check its progress: when the ministers
propose any thing with regard to the rebellion, he cries,
"Pho! don't talk to me of that stuff." Lord Granville has
persuaded him that it is of no consequence.  Mr. Pelham talks
every day of resigning: he certainly will as soon as this is
got over!--if it is got over.  So, at least we shall see a
restoration of queen Sophia.(1106)  She has lain-in of a
girl; though she had all the pretty boys in town brought to
her for patterns.

The young Chevalier has set a reward on the King's head: we
are told that his brother is set out for Ireland.  However,
there is hitherto little countenance given to the undertaking
by France or Spain.  It seems an effort of despair, and
weariness of the manner in which he has been kept in France.
On the grenadier's caps is written, "a grave or a throne."  He
stayed some time at the Duke of Athol's, whither old Marquis
Tullybardine(1107) sent to bespeak dinner; and has since sent
his brother word, that he likes the alterations made there.
The Pretender found pine-apples there, the first he ever
tasted.  Mr. Breton,(1108) a great favourite of the Southern
Prince of Wales, went the other day to visit the Duchess of
Athol,(1109) and happened not to know that she is parted from
her husband: he asked how the Duke did?, "Oh," said she, "he
turned me out of his house, and now he is turned out himself."
Every now and then a Scotchman comes and pulls the Boy by the
sleeve; "Prence, here is another mon taken!" then with all the
dignity in the world, the Boy hopes nobody was killed in the
action! Lord Bath has made a piece of a ballad, the Duke of
Newcastle's speech to the Regency; I have heard but these two
lines of it:

"Pray consider my Lords, how disastrous a thing,
To have two Prince of Wales's and never a King!"

The merchants are very zealous, and are opening a great
subscription for raising troops.  The other day, at the city
meeting, to draw up the address, Alderman Heathcote proposed a
petition for a redress of grievances, but not one man seconded
him.  In the midst of all this, no Parliament is called!  The
ministers say they have nothing ready to offer; but they have
something to notify!

I must tell you a ridiculous accident: when the magistrates of
were searching houses for arms, they came to Mr. Maule's,
brother of Lord Panmure, and a great friend of the Duke of
Argyll.  The maid would not let them go into one room, which
was locked, and as she said, full of arms.  They now thought
they had found what they looked for, and had the door broke
open--where they found an ample collection of coats of arms!

The deputy governor of Edinburgh Castle has threatened the
magistrates to beat their town about their ears, if they admit
the rebels.  Perth is twenty-four miles from Edinburgh, so we
must soon know whether they will go thither; or leave it, and
come into England.  We have great hopes that the Highlanders
will not follow him so far.  Very few of them could be
persuaded the last time to go to Preston; and several refused
to attend King Charles II. when he marched to Worcester.  The
Caledonian Mercury never calls them "the rebels," but "the
Highlanders."

Adieu! my dear child --thank Mr. Chute for his letter, which I
will answer soon.  I don't know how to define my feeling: I
don't despair, and yet I expect nothing but bad! Yours, etc.

p . S. Is not my Princess very happy with the hopes of the
restoration of her old tenant?(1110)

438 Letter 179a
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Sept. 17, 1745.

Dear George,
How could u ask me such a question, as whether I should be
glad to see you?  Have you a mind I should make you a formal
speech, with honour, and pleasure, and satisfaction, etc.?  I
will not, for that would be telling you I should not be glad.
However, do come soon, if you should be glad to see me; for
we, I mean we old folks that came over with the Prince of
Orange in eighty-eight, have had notice to remove by
Christmas-day.  The moment I have SMUgged up a closet or a
dressing-room, I have always warning given me that my lease is
out.  Four years ago I was mightily at my ease in
Downing-street, and then the good woman, Sandys, took my
lodgings over my head, and was in such a hurry to junket her
neighbours, that I had scarce time allowed me to wrap my old
china in a little hay.  Now comes the Pretender's boy, and
promises all my comfortable apartments in the Exchequer and
Custom-house to some forlorn Irish peer, who chooses to remove
his pride and poverty out of some large unfurnished gallery at
St. Germain's.  Why really Mr. Montagu this is not pleasant; I
shall wonderfully dislike being a loyal sufferer in a
threadbare coat, and shivering in an ante-chamber at Hanover,
or reduced to teach Latin and English to the young princes at
Copenhagen.  The Dowager Strafford has already written cards
for my Lady Nithisdale, my Lady Tullibardine, the Duchess of
Perth and berwick, and twenty more revived peeresses, to
invite them to play at whist, Monday three months: for your
part, you will divert yourself with their old taffeties, and
tarnished slippers, and their awkwardness, the first day they
go to court in shifts and clean linen.  Will you ever write to
me at my garret at Herenhausen? I will give you a faithful
account of all the promising speeches that Prince George and
Prince Edward make, -whenever they have a new sword, and
intend to re-conquer England.  At least write to me, while you
may with acts of parliament on your side: but I hope you are
coming.  Adieu!




439 Letter 180
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Sept. 20, 1745.

One really don't know what to write to you: the accounts from
Scotland vary perpetually, and at best are never very certain.
I was just going to tell you that the rebels are in England;
but my Uncle is this moment come in, and says, that an express
came last night with an account of their being in Edinburgh to
the number of five thousand.  This sounds great, to have
walked through a kingdom, and taken possession of the capital!
But this capital is an open town and the castle impregnable,
and in our possession.  There never was so extraordinary a
sort of rebellion! One can't tell what assurances of support
they may have from the Jacobites in England, or from the
French; but nothing of either sort has yet appeared-and if
there does not, never was so desperate an enterprise.(1111)
One can hardly believe that the English are more disaffected
than the Scotch; and among the latter, no persons of property
have joined them: both nations seem to profess a neutrality.
Their money is all gone, and they subsist. merely by levying
contributions.  But, sure, banditti can never conquer a
kingdom! On the other hand, what cannot any number of men do,
who meet no opposition? They have hitherto taken no place but
open towns, nor have they any artillery for a siege but
one-pounders.  Three battalions of  Dutch are landed at
Gravesend, and ,re ordered to Lancashire: we expect every
moment to hear that the rest are got to Scotland; none of our
own are come yet.  Lord Granville and his faction persist in
persuading the King, that it is an affair of no consequence;
and for the Duke of Newcastle, he is glad when the rebels make
any progress, in order to confute Lord Granville's assertions.
The best of our situation is, our strength at sea: the Channel
is well guarded, and twelve men-of-war more are arrived from
rowley.  Vernon, that simple noisy creature, has hit upon a
scheme that is of great service; he has laid Folkstone cutters
all round the coast, which are continually relieved, and bring
constant notice of every thing that stirs.  I just hear, that
the Duke of Bedford(1112) declares he will be amused no
longer, but will ask the King's leave to raise a regiment.
The Duke of Montagu has a troop of horse ready, and the Duke
of Devonshire is raising men in Derbyshire.  The Yorkshiremen,
headed by the Archbishop and Lord Malton, meet the gentlemen
of the county the day after to-morrow to defend that part of
England.  Unless we have more ill fortune than is conceivable,
or the general supineness continues, it is impossible but we
must get over this.  You desire me to send you news: I confine
myself to tell you nothing but what you may depend upon and
leave you in a fright rather than deceive you.  I confess my
own apprehensions are not near so strong as they were: and if
we get over this, I shall believe that we never can be hurt;
for we never can be more exposed to danger.  Whatever
disaffection there is to the present family, it plainly does
not proceed from love to the other.

My Lady O. makes little progress in popularity.  Neither the
protection of my Lady Pomfret's prudery, nor of my Lady
Townshend's libertinism, do her any services The women stare
at her, think her ugly, awkward, and disagreeable; and what is
worse, the men think so too.  For the height of mortification,
the
King has declared publicly to the ministry, that he has been
told of the great civilities which be was said to show her at
Hanover; that he protests he showed her only the common
civilities due to any English lady that comes thither; that he
never intended to take any particular notice of her; nor had,
nor would let my Lady Yarmouth. - In fact, my Lady Yarmouth
peremptorily refused to carry her to court here: and when she
did go with my Lady Pomfret, the King but just spoke to her.
She declares her intention of staying in England, and protests
against all lawsuits and violences; and says she only asks
articles of separation, and to have her allowance settled by
any two arbitrators chosen by my brother and herself.  I have
met her twice at my Lady Townshend's, just as I used at
Florence.  She dresses English and plays at whist.  I forgot
to tell a bon-mot of Leheup(1113) on her first coming over; he
was asked if he would not go and see her? He replied "No, I
never visit modest women." Adieu! my dear child! I flatter
myself you will collect hopes from this letter.

(1111) Mr. Henry Fox, in letters to Sir C. H. Williams, of
September 5th and 19th, writes, "England, Wade says, and I
believe it, is for the first comer; and if you can tell
whether the six thousand Dutch, and the ten battalions of
English, or five thousand French or Spaniards will be here
first, you know our fate." "The French are not come, God be
thanked! But had five thousand landed in any part of this
island a week ago, I verily believe the entire conquest would
not have cost them a battle."-B.

(1112) This plan of raising regiment,,; afterwards degenerated
into a gross job.  Sir C. H. Williams gives an account of it
in his ballad, entitled "The Herbes." To this Horace Walpole
appended the following explanatory note..--"In the time of the
rebellion, these lords had proposed to raise regiments of
their own dependents, and were allowed; Had they paid them
too, the service had been noble: being paid by Government,
obscured a little the merit; being paid without raising them,
would deserve too coarse a term.  It is certain, that not six
regiments ever were raised: not four of which were employed.
The chief persons who were at the head of this scheme were the
Dukes of Bedford and Montagu; the Duke of Bedford actually and
served with his regiment."--The other lords mentioned in the
ballad are, the Duke of Bolton, Lord Granby, Lord Harcourt,
Lord Halifax, Lord Falmouth, Lord Cholmondeley, and Lord
Berkeley.  They were in all fifteen-

"Fifteen nobles of great fame,
All brib'd by one false muster."-D.

elder.  He was a man of great wit and greater brutality, and
being minister at Hanover, was recalled for very indecent
behaviour there.



441 Letter 181
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Sept. 27, 1745.

I can't doubt but the joy of the Jacobites has reached
Florence before this letter.  Your two or three Irish priests,
I forget their names, will have set out to take possession of
abbey-lands here.  I feel for what you will feel, and for the
insulting things that will be said to you upon the
battle(1114) we have lost in Scotland; but all this is
nothing, to what it prefaces.  The express came hither on
Tuesday morning, but the Papists knew it on Sunday night.
Cope lay in face of the rebels all Friday; he scarce two
thousand strong, they vastly superior, though we don't know
their numbers.  The military people say that he should have
attacked them.  However, we are sadly convinced that they are
not such raw ragamuffins as they were represented. The
rotation that has been established in that country, to give
all the Highlanders the benefit of serving in the independent
companies, has trained and disciplined them.  Macdonald (I
suppose, he from Naples,) -who is reckoned a very experienced
able officer, is said to have commanded them, and to be
dangerously wounded.  One does not hear the Boy's personal
valour cried up; by which I conclude he was not in the
action.(1115)  Our dragoons most shamefully fled without
striking a blow, and are with Cope, who escaped in a boat to
Berwick.  I pity poor him(1116) who with no shining abilities,
and no experience, and no force, was sent to fight for a
crown! He never saw a battle but that of Dettingen, where he
got his red riband: Churchill, whose led-captain he was, and
my Lord Harrington, had pushed him up to this misfortune.  We
have lost all our artillery, five hundred men taken and three
killed, and several officers, as you will see in the papers.
This defeat has frightened every body but those it rejoices,
and those it should frighten most; but my Lord Granville still
buoys up the King's spirits, and persuades him it is nothing.
He uses his ministers as ill as possible, and discourages
every body that would risk their lives and fortunes with him.
Marshal Wade is marching against the rebels; but the King will
not let him take above eight thousand men; so that if they
come into England, another battle, with no advantage on our
side, may determine our fate.  Indeed, they don't seem so
unwise as to risk their cause upon so precarious an event; but
rather to design to establish themselves in Scotland, till
they can be supported from France, and be set up with taking
Edinburgh Castle, where there is to the value of a million,
and which they would make a stronghold.  It is scarcely
victualled for a month, and must surely fall into their hands.
Our coasts are greatly guarded, and London kept in awe by the
arrival of the guards.  I don't believe what I have been told
this morning, that more troops are sent for from Flanders, and
aid asked of Denmark.

Prince Charles has called a Parliament in Scotland for the 7th
of October; ours does not meet till the 17th, so that even in
the show of liberty and laws, they are beforehand with us.
With all this, we hear of no men of quality or fortune having
joined him but Lord Elcho(1117) whom you have seen at
Florence; and the Duke of Perth,(1118) a silly race-horsing
boy, who is said to be killed in this battle.  but I gather no
confidence from hence: my father always said, "If you see them
come again, they will begin by their lowest people; their
chiefs will not appear till the end." His prophecies verify
every day!

The town is still empty; in this point only the English act
contrary to their custom, for they don't throng to see a
Parliament, though it is likely to prove a curiosity!

I have so trained myself to expect this ruin, that I see it
approach without an emotion.  I shall suffer with fools,
without having any malice to our enemies, who act sensibly
from principle and from interest.  Ruling parties seldom have
caution or common sense.  I don't doubt but Whigs and
Protestants will be alert enough in trying to recover what
they lose so supinely.

I know nothing of my Lady O. In this situation I dare say she
will exert enough of the spirit of her Austrian party, to be
glad the present government is oppressed; her piques and the
Queen of Hungary's bigotry will draw satisfaction from what
ought to be so contrary to each of their wishes.  I don't
wonder my lady hates you so much, as I think she meant to
express by her speech to Blair.
Quem non credit Cleopatra nocentem,
A quo casta fuit?"

She lives chiefly with my Lady Townshend: the latter told me
last night, that she had seen a new fat player, who looked
like every body's husband.  I replied, "I could easily believe
that, from seeing so many women who looked like every body's
wives." Adieu! my dear Sir: I hope your spirits, like mine,
will grow calm, from being callous of ill news.

(1114) At Preston-Pans, near Edinburgh; where the Pretender
completely defeated Sir John Cope, on the 21st of
September.-D.

(1115) "Charles," says Lord Mahon, 'put himself at the head of
the second line, which was close behind the first, and
addressed them in these words@ Follow me, gentlemen, and by
the blessing of God, I will this day make you a free and happy
people." Hist. Vol. iii. P. 392.-E.

(1116) General Cope was tried afterwards for his behaviour in
this action, and it appeared very clearly, that the ministry,
his inferior officers, and his troops, were greatly to blame;
and that he did all he could, so ill-directed, so
ill-supplied, and so ill-obeyed.

(1117) Eldest son of the Earl of Wemyss.

(1118) James Drummond, who would have been the fifth Earl of
Perth, had it not been for the attainder and outlawry under
which his family laboured.  His grandfather, the fourth earl,
had been created a duke by James II. after his abdication.  He
was not killed at Preston-Pans.-D.



443 Letter 182
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Oct. 4, 1745.

I am still writing to you as "R`esident de sa Majest`e
Britannique;" and without the apprehension of your suddenly
receiving letters of recall, or orders to notify to the
council of Florence the new accession.  I dare say your fears
made you think that the young Prince (for he is at least
Prince of Scotland) had vaulted from Cope's neck into St.
James's House; but he is still at Edinburgh; and his cousin
Grafton, the lord chamberlain has not even given orders for
fitting up this palace for his reception.  The good people of
England have at last rubbed their eyes and looked about them.
A wonderful spirit is arisen in all counties, and among all
sorts of people.  The nobility are raising regiments, and
every body else is-being raised.  Dr. Herring,(1119) the
Archbishop of York, has set an example that would rouse the
most indifferent; in two days after the news arrived at York
of Cope's defeat, and when they every moment expected the
victorious rebels at their gates, the bishop made a speech to
the assembled county, that had as much true spirit, honesty,
and bravery in it, as ever was penned by an historian for an
ancient hero.

The rebels returned to Edinburgh, where they have no hopes of
taking the Castle, for old Preston, the deputy-governor, and
General Guest, have obliged them to supply the Castle
constantly with fresh provisions, on pain of having the town
fired with red-hot bullets.  They did fling a bomb on Holyrood
House, and obliged the Boy to shift his quarters.  Wade is
marching against them, and will have a great army: all the
rest of our troops are ordered from Flanders, and are to meet
him in Yorkshire, with some Hessians too.  That county raises
four thousand men, besides a body of foxhunters, whom
Oglethorpe has converted into hussars.  I am told that old
Stair, who certainly does not want zeal, but may not want envy
neither, has practised a little Scotch art to prevent wade
from having an army, and consequently the glory of saving this
country.  This I don't doubt he will do, if the rebels get no
foreign aid; and I have great reason to hope they will not,
for the French are privately making us overtures of peace.  My
dear child, dry your wet-brown-paperness, and be in spirits
again!

It is not a very civil joy to send to Florence, but I can't
help telling you how glad I am of news that came two days ago,
of the King of Prussia having beat Prince Charles,(1120) who
attacked him just after we could have obtained for them a
peace with that King.  That odious house of Austria!  It will
not be decent for you to insult Richcourt but I would, were I
at Florence.

Pray let Mr. Chute have ample accounts of our zeal to figure
with at Rome. of the merchants of London undertaking to
support the public credit; of universal associations; of
regiments raised by the dukes of Devonshire, Bedford, Rutland,
Montagu; Lords Herbert, Halifax, Cholmondeley, Falmouth,
Malton, Derby,(1121) etc.; of Wade with an army of twenty
thousand men; of another about London of near as many--and
lastly, of Lord Gower having in person assured the King that
he is no Jacobite, but ready to serve him with his life and
fortune.  Tell him of the whole coast so guarded, that nothing
can pass unvisited; and in short, send him this advertisement
out of to-day's papers, as an instance of more spirit and wit
than there is in all Scotland:

TO ALL JOLLY BUTCHERS.
MY BOLD hearts,
The Papists eat no meat on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays, nor
during Lent.
Your friend,
JOHN STEEL.

Just as I wrote this, a person is come in, who tells me that
the rebels have cut off the communication between Edinburgh
and the Castle: the commanders renewed their threats: and the
good magistrates have sent up hither to beg orders may be sent
to forbid this execution.  It is modest! it is Scotch!-and, I
dare say, will be granted.  Ask a government to spare your
town which you yourself have given up to rebels: and the
consequence of which will be the loss of your Castle!-but they
knew to what Government they applied! You need not be in haste
to have this notified at Rome.  Tell it not in Gath! Adieu! my
dear Sir.  This account has put Me so out of humour, and has
so altered the strain of my letter, that I must finish.

(1119) An excellent prelate, afterwards promoted to the see of
Canterbury.  Walpole, in his Memoires, mentioning his death,
thus speaks of him: "On the 13th of March, 1757, died Dr.
Herring, Archbishop of Canterbury a very amiable man, to whom
no fault was objected; though perhaps the gentleness of his
Principles, his great merit, was thought one.  During the
rebellion he had taken up arms to defend from oppression that
religion, which he abhorred making an instrument of
oppression."-D.

(1120) The battle of Soor in Bohemia, gained by the King of
Prussia over the Austrians, on the 30th of September, 1745.-D.

(1121) For an account of this transaction see note 1112,
letter 181, at p. 440.  The noblemen here mentioned were,
William Cavendish, Third Duke of Devonshire; John Russell,
fourth Duke of Bedford; John, second and last Duke of Montagu;
Henry Arthur Herbert, first Lord Herbert of cherbury of the
third creation; George Montagu, third Earl of Halifax; George,
third Earl of Cholmondeley; Hugh Boscawen, second Viscount
Falmouth; Thomas Wentworth, first Earl of Malton; and Edward
Stanley, eleventh Earl of Derby.--D.



445 Letter 183
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Oct. 11, 1745.

This is likely to be a very short letter; for I have nothing
to tell you, nor any thing to answer.  I have not had one
letter from you this month, which I attribute to the taking of
the packet-boat by the French, with two mails in it.  It was a
very critical time for our negotiations; the ministry will
say, it puts their transactions out of order.

Before I talk of any public news, I must tell you what you
will be very sorry for-Lady Granville is dead.  She had a
fever for six weeks before her lying-in, and could never get
it off.  Last Saturday they called in another physician, Dr.
Oliver; on Monday he pronounced her out of danger.  About
seven in the evening, as Lady Pomfret and Lady Charlotte were
sitting by her, the first notice they had of her immediate
danger, was her sighing and saying, "I feel death come very
fast upon me!" She repeated the same words frequently-remained
perfectly in her senses and calm, and died about eleven at
night.  Her mother and sister sat by her till she was cold.
It is very shocking for any body so young, so handsome, so
arrived at the height of happiness, so sensible of it, and on
whom all the joy and grandeur of her family depended, to be so
quickly snatched away! Poor Uguccioni! he will be very sorry
and simple about it.

For the rebels, they have made no figure since Their victory.
The Castle of Edinburgh has made a sally and taken twenty head
of cattle, and about thirty head of Highlanders.  We heard
yesterday, that they are coming this way.  The troops from
Flanders are expected to land in Yorkshire to-morrow.  A
privateer of Bristol has taken a large Spanish ship, laden
with arms and money for Scotland.  A piece of a plot has been
discovered in Dorsetshire, and one Mr. Weld(1122) taken up.
The French have declared to the Dutch, that the House of
Stuart is their ally, and that the Dutch troops must not act
against them; but we expect they shall.  The Parliament meets
next Thursday, and by that time, probably, the armies will
too.  The rebels are not above eight thousand, and have little
artillery; so you may wear what ministerial spirits you will.

The Venetian ambassador has been making his entries this week:
he was at Leicester-fields to-day with the Prince, and very
pretty compliments passed between them in Italian.  Do excuse
this letter; i really have not a word more to say; the next
shall be all arma virumque cano!

(1122) Edward Weld, Esq. of Lulworth Castle.  Hutchins, in his
History of Dorsetshire, says, that, "although he ever behaved
as a peaceful subject, he was ordered into custody, in 1745,
on account of his name being mentioned in a treasonable
anonymous letter dropped near Poole; but his immediate and
honourable discharge is the most convincing proof of his
innocence."-E.




446 Letter 184
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Oct. 21, 1745.

I had been almost as long without any of Your letters as you
had without mine; but yesterday I received one, dated the 5th
of this month, N. S.

The rebels have not left their camp near Edinburgh, and, I
suppose, will not now, unless to retreat into the Highlands.
General Wade was to march yesterday from Doncaster for
Scotland.  By their not advancing, I conclude that either the
Boy and his council could not prevail On the Highlanders to
leave their own country, or that they were not strong enough,
and still wait for foreign assistance, which, in a new
declaration, he intimates that he still expects.(1123)  One
only ship, I believe a Spanish one, has got to them with arms,
and Lord John Drummond(1124) and some people of quality on
board.  We don't hear that the younger Boy is of the number.
Four ships sailed from Corunna; the one that got to Scotland,
one taken by a privateer of bristol, and one lost on the Irish
coast; the fourth is not heard of.  At Edinburgh and
thereabouts they commit the most horrid barbarities.  We last
night expected as bad here: information was given of an
intended insurrection and massacre by the Papists; all the
Guards were ordered out, and the Tower shut up at seven.  I
cannot be surprised at any thing, considering the supineness
of the ministry--nobody has yet been taken up!

The Parliament met on Thursday.  I don't think, considering
the crisis, that the House was very full. Indeed, many of the
Scotch members cannot come if they would.  The young Pretender
had published a declaration, threatening to confiscate the
estates of Scotch that should come to Parliament, and making
it treason for the English.  The only points that have been
before the house, the address and the suspension of the Habeas
Corpus, met with obstructions from the Jacobites.  By this we
may expect what spirit they will show hereafter.(1125)  With
all this, I am far            from thinking that they are so
confident and sanguine as their friends at Rome.  I blame the
Chutes extremely for cockading themselves: why take a part
when they are only travelling? I should certainly retire to
Florence on this occasion.

You may imagine how little I like our situation; but I don't
despair.  The little use they made, or could make of their
victory; their not having marched into England; their
miscarriage at the Castle of Edinburgh; the arrival of our
forces, and the non-arrival of any French or Spanish, make me
conceive great hopes of getting over this ugly business.  But
it is still an affair wherein the chance Of battles, or
perhaps of one battle, may decide.

I write you but short letters, considering the circumstances
of the time; but I hate to send you paragraphs only to
contradict them again: I still less choose to forge events;
and, indeed, am glad I have so few to tell you.

My lady O. has forced herself upon her mother, who receives
her very coolly: she talks highly of her demands, and quietly
of her methods - the fruitlessness of either will, I hope,
soon send her back--I am sorry it must be to you!

You mention Holdisworth:(1126) he has had the confidence to
come and visit me within these ten days; and (I suppose, from
the overflowing of his joy) talked a great deal and with as
little sense as when he was more tedious.

Since I wrote this, I hear the Countess has told her mother,
that she thinks her husband the best of our family, and me the
worst--nobody so bad, except you! I don't wonder at my being
so ill with her; but what have you done? or is it, that we are
worse than any body, because we know more of her than any body
does! Adieu!

(1123) "At three several councils did Charles propose to march
into England and fight Marshal Wade; but as often was his
proposal overruled.  At length he declared in a very
peremptory manner, 'I see, gentlemen, you are determined to
stay in Scotland and defend your country; but I am not less
resolved to try my fate in England, though I should go
alone.'" Lord Mahon, vol. iii. P.241.-E.

(1124) Brother of the titular Duke of Perth.

(1125) "As to the Parliament," writes Horatio Walpole to Mr.
Milling, on the 29th of October, "although the address was
unanimous the first day, yesterday, upon a motion 'to enquire
into the causes of the progress of the rebellion' the House
was so fully convinced of the necessity of immediately putting
an end to it, and that the fire should be quenched before we
should enquire who kindled or promoted it, that it was
carried, not to put the question at this time, by 194 against
112."-E.

(1126) A nonjuror who travelled with Mr. George Pitt.



447 Letter 185
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 4, 1745.

It is just a fortnight since I wrote to you last: in all that
time the rebellion has made no progress, nor produced any
incidents worth mentioning.  They have entrenched themselves
very strongly in the Duke of Buccleuch's park, whose seat,
about seven miles from Edinburgh, they have seized.  We had an
account last week of the Boy's being retired to Dunkirk, but
it was not true.  Kelly,(1127) who is gone to solicit succour
from France, was seized at Helvoet, but by a stupid burgher
released.  Lord Loudon is very brisk in the north of Scotland,
and has intercepted and beat some of their parties.  Marshal
Wade was to march from Newcastle yesterday.

But the rebellion does not make half the noise here that one
of its consequences does.

Fourteen lords (most of them I have named to you), at the
beginning, offered to raise regiments; these regiments, so
handsomely tendered at first, have been since put on the
regular establishment; not much to the honour of the
undertakers or of the firmness of the ministry, and the King
is to pay them.  One of the great grievances of this is, that
these most disinterested colonels have named none but their
own relations and dependents for the officers, who are to have
rank; and consequently, both colonels and subalterns will
interfere with the brave old part of the army, who have served
all the war.  This has made great clamour.  The King was
against their having rank, but would not refuse it; yet wished
that the House of Commons would address him not to grant it.
This notification of his royal mind encouraged some of the old
part of the ministry, particularly Winnington and Fox, to
undertake to procure this Address.  Friday it came on in the
committee; the Jacobites and patriots (such as are not
included in the coalition) violently opposed the regiments
themselves; so did Fox, in a very warm speech, levelled
particularly at the Duke of Montagu, who, besides his old
regiment, has one Of horse and one of foot on this new
plan.(1128)  Pitt defended them as warmly: the Duke of
Bedford, Lord Gower, and Lord Halifax, being at the head of
this job.  At last, at ten at night, the thirteen regiments of
foot were voted without a division, and the two of horse
carried by 192 to 82.  Then came the motion for the address,
and in an hour and half more, was rejected by 126 to 124.  Of
this latter number were several of the old corps; I among the
rest.  It is to be reported to the House to-morrow, and will,
I conclude, be at least as warm a day as the former.  The King
is now against the address, and all sides are using their
utmost efforts.  The fourteen lords threaten to throw up,
unless their whole terms are complied with; and the Duke of
Bedford is not moderately insolent against such of the King's
servants as voted against him.  Mr. Pelham espouses him; not
recollecting that at least twice a-week all his new allies are
suffered to oppose him as they please.  I should be sorry, for
the appearance, to have the regiments given up; but I am sure
our affair is over, if our two old armies are beaten and we
should come to want these new ones; four only of which are
pretended to be raised.  Pitt, who has alternately bullied and
flattered Mr. Pelham, is at last to be secretary-at-war;(1129)
Sir W. Yonge to be removed to vice-treasurer of Ireland, and
Lord Torrington(1130) to have a pension in lieu of it.  An
ungracious parallel between the mercenary views Of these
patriot heroes, the regiment-factors, and of their acquiescent
agents, the ministry, with the disinterested behaviour of m
Lord Kildare,(1131) was drawn on Friday by Lord Doneraile; who
read the very proposals of the latter for raising, clothing,
and arming a regiment at his own expense, and for which he had
been told, but the very day before this question, that the
King had no occasion.--"And how," said Lord Doneraile, "can
one account for this, but by saying, that we have a ministry
who are either too good-natured to refuse a wrong thing, or
too irresolute to do a right one!"

I am extremely pleased with the, purchase of the Eagle and
Altar, and think them cheap: and I even begin to believe that
I shall be able to pay for them.  The gesse statues are all
arrived safe.  Your last letter was dated Oct. 19, N. S. and
left you up to the chin in water(1132) just as we were drowned
five years ago.  Good night, if you are alive still!

449 Letter 186
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 15, 1745.

I told you in my last what disturbance there had been about
the new regiments; the affair of rank was again disputed on
the report till ten at night, and carried by a majority of 23.
The King had been persuaded to appear for it, though Lord
Granville made it a party point against Mr. Pelham.
Winnington did not speak.  I was not there, for I could not
vote for it, and yielded not to give any hindrance to a public
measure (or at least what was called so) ' just now.  The
Prince acted openly, and influenced his people against it; but
it, only served to let Mr. Pelham see, what, like every thing
else, he did not know, how strong he is.  The King will scarce
speak to him, and he cannot yet get Pitt into place.

The rebels are come into England: for two days we believed
them near Lancaster, but the ministry now own that they don't
know if they have passed Carlisle.  Some think they will
besiege that town, which has an old wall, and the militia in
it of Cumberland and Westmoreland; but as they can pass by it,
I don't see why they should take it; for they are not strong
enough to leave garrisons.  Several desert them as they
advance south; and altogether, good men and bad, nobody
believes them ten thousand.  By their marching westward to
avoid Wade, it is evident they are not strong enough to fight
him.  They may yet retire back into their mountains, but if
once they get to Lancaster, their retreat is cut off; for Wade
'will not stir from Newcastle, till he has embarked them deep
into England, and then he will be behind them.  He has sent
General Handasyde from Berwick with two regiments to take
possession of Edinburgh.  The rebels are certainly in a Very
desperate situation: they dared not meet Wade; and if they had
waited for him their troops would have deserted.  Unless they
meet with great risings in their favour in Lancashire, I don't
see what they can hope, except from a continuation of our
neglect.  That, indeed, has nobly exerted itself for them.
They were suffered to march the whole length of Scotland, and
take possession of the capital, without a man appearing
against them.  Then two thousand men sailed to them, to run
from them.  Till the flight of Cope's army, Wade was not sent.
'Two roads still lay into England, and till they had chosen
that which Wade had not taken, no
 army was thought of being sent to secure the other.  Now
Ligonier, with seven old regiments, and six of the new, is
ordered to Lancashire: before this first division of the army
could get to Coventry, they are forced to order it to halt,
for fear the enemy should be up with it before it was all
assembled.  It is uncertain if the rebels will march to the
north of Wales, to Bristol, or towards London.  If to the
latter, Ligonier must fight the n: if to either of the other,
I hope, the two armies may join and drive them into a corner,
where they must all perish.  They cannot subsist in Wales, but
by being supplied by the' Papists in Ireland(.  The best is,
that we are in no fear from France; there is no preparation
for invasions in any of their ports.  Lord Clancarty,(1133) a
Scotchman of great parts, but mad and drunken, and whose
family forfeited 90,000 pounds a-@ear for King James, is made
vice-admiral at Brest.  The Duke of Bedford goes in his little
round person with his regiment: he now takes to the land, and
says he is tired of being a pen and ink man.  Lord Gower too,
insisted upon going with his regiment, but is laid up with the
gout.

With the rebels in England, you may imagine we have no private
news, nor think of foreign.  From this account you may judge,
that our case is far from desperate, though disagreeable, The
Prince, while the Princess lies-in, has taken to give dinners,
to which he asks two of the ladies of the bedchamber, two of
the maids of honour, etc. by turns, and five or six others.
He sits at the head of the table, drinks and harangues to all
this medley till nine at night; and the other day, after the
affair of the regiments, drank Mr. Fox's health in a bumper,
with three huzzas, for opposing Mr. Pelham--

"Si quel fata aspera rumpas,
Tu Marcellus eris!"

You put me in pain for my eagle, and in more for the Chutes;
whose zeal is very heroic, but very ill-placed.  I long to
hear that all my Chutes and eagles are safe out of the Pope's
hands! Pray wish the Suares's joy of all their espousals.
Does the Princess pray abundantly for her friend the
Pretender? Is she extremely abbatue with her devotion? and
does she fast till she has got a violent appetite for supper?
And then, does she eat so long that old Sarrasin is quite
impatient to go to cards again? Good night!  I intend you
shall be resident from King George.

P. S. I forgot to tell you, that the other day I concluded the
ministry knew the danger was all over; for the Duke of
Newcastle ventured to have the Pretender's declaration burnt
at the Royal Exchange.

451 Letter 187
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 22, 1745.

For these two days we have been expecting news of a battle.
Wade marched last Saturday from Newcastle, and must have got
up with the rebels, if they stayed for him, though the roads
are exceedingly bad and great quantities of snow have fallen.
But last night there was some notice of a body of rebels being
advanced to Penryth.  We were put into great spirits by an
heroic letter from the mayor of Carlisle, who had fired on the
rebels and made them retire; he concluded with saying, "And so
I think the town of Carlisle has done his Majesty more service
than the great city of Edinburgh, or than all Scotland
together."  But this hero, who was crown the whole fashion for
four-and-twenty hours, had chosen to stop all other letters.
The King spoke of him at his levee with great encomiums; Lord
Stair said, "Yes, sir, Mr. Patterson has behaved very
bravely." The Duke of Bedford interrupted him; "My lord, his
name is not Paterson; that is a Scotch name; his name is
Patinson." But, alack! the next day the rebels returned, having
placed the women and children of the country in wagons
in front of their army, and forcing the peasants to fix the
scaling-ladders.  The great Mr. Pattinson, or Patterson (for
now his name may be which one pleases,) instantly surrendered
the town and agreed to pay two thousand pounds to save it from
pillage.  Well! then we were assured that the citadel could
hold out seven or eight days but did not so many hours.  On
mustering the militia, there were not found above four men in
a company; and for two companies, which the ministry, on a
report of Lord Albemarle, who said they were to be sent from
Wade's army, thought were there, and did not know were not
there, there was nothing but two of invalids.  Colonel Durand,
the governor, fled, because he would not sign the
capitulation, by which the garrison, it is said, has sworn
never to bear arms against the house of Stuart.  The Colonel
sent two expresses, one to Wade, and another to Ligonier at
Preston; but the latter was playing at whist with Lord
Harrington at Petersham.  Such is our diligence and attention!
All my hopes are in Wade, who was so sensible of the ignorance
of our governors that he refused to accept the command, till
they consented that he should be subject to no kind of orders
from hence.  The rebels are reckoned up to thirteen thousand;
Wade marches with about twelve; but if they come southward,
the other army will probably be to fight them; the Duke is to
command it, and sets out next week with another brigade of
Guards, and Ligonier under him.  There are great apprehensions
for Chester from the Flintshire-men, who are ready to rise.  A
quartermaster, first sent to Carlisle, was seized and carried
to Wade; he behaved most insolently; and being asked by the
General, how many the rebels were, replied, "enough to beat
any army you have in England." A Mackintosh has been taken,
who reduces their formidability, by being sent to raise two
clans, and with orders, if they would not rise, at least to
give out they had risen, for that three clans would leave the
Pretender, unless joined by those two.  Five hundred new
rebels are arrived at Perth, where our prisoners are kept.

I had this morning a subscription pool@ brought me for our
parish; Lord Granville had refused to subscribe.  This is in
the style of his friend Lord Bath, who has absented himself
whenever any act of authority was to be executed against the
rebels.

Five Scotch lords are going to raise regiments `a l'Angloise!
resident in London, while the rebels were in Scotland; they
are to receive military emoluments for their neutrality!

The Fox man-of-war of twenty guns is lost off Dunbar.  One
Beavor, the captain, had done us notable service: the
Pretender sent to commend his zeal and activity, and to tell
him, that if he would return to his allegiance, be should soon
have a flag.  Beavor replied, "he never treated with any but
principals; that if the Pretender would come on board him, he
would talk with him." I must now tell you of our great Vernon:
without once complaining to the ministry, he has written to
Sir John Philipps, a distinguished Jacobite, to complain of
want of provisions; yet they do not venture to recall him!
Yesterday they had another baiting from Pitt, who is ravenous
for the place of secretary at war: they would give it him; but
as a preliminary, he insists on a declaration of our having
nothing to do with the Continent.  He mustered his forces, but
did not notify his intention; only at two o'clock Lyttelton
said at the Treasury, that there would be business at the
House.  The motion was to augment our naval force, which, Pitt
said, was the only method of putting an end to the rebellion.
Ships built a year hence to suppress an army of Highlanders,
now marching through England!  My uncle attacked him, and
congratulated his country on the wisdom of the modern young
men; and said he had a son of two-and-twenty, who, he did not
doubt, would come over wiser than any of them.  Pitt was
provoked, and retorted on his negotiations and greyheaded
experience.  At those words, my uncle, as if he had been at
Bartholomew fair, snatched off his wig, and showed his gray
hairs, which made the august senate laugh, and put Pitt out,
who, after laughing himself, diverted his venom upon Mr.
Pelham.  Upon the question, Pitt's party amounted but to
thirty-six: in short, he has nothing left but his words, and
his haughtiness, and his Lytteltons, and his Grenvilles.
Adieu!



453 Letter 188
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 29, 1745.

We have had your story here this week of the pretended
pretender, but with the unlucky circumstance of its coming
from the Roman Catholics.  With all the faith you have in your
little spy, I cannot believe it; though, to be sure, it has a
Stuart-air, the not exposing the real boy to danger.  The Duke
of Newcastle mentioned your account this morning to my uncle;
but they don't give any credit to the courier's relation.  It
grows so near being necessary for the young man to get off by
any evasion, that I am persuaded all that party will try to
have it believed.  We are so far from thinking that they have
not sent us one son, that two days ago we believed we had got
the other too.  A small ship has taken the Soleil privateer
from Dunkirk, going to Montrose, with twenty French officers,
sixty others, and the brother of the beheaded Lord
Derwentwater and his son,(1134) who at first was believed to
be the second boy.  News came yesterday of a second privateer,
taken with arms and money; of another lost on the Dutch coast,
and of Vernon being in pursuit of two more.  All this must be
a great damp to the party, who are coming on--fast--fast to
their destruction.  Last night they were to be at Preston, but
several repeated accounts make them under five thousand--none
above seven; they must have diminished greatly by desertion.
The country is so far from rising for them, that the towns are
left desolate on their approach, and the people hide and bury
their effects, even to their pewter.  Warrington bridge is
broken down, which will turn them some miles aside.  The Duke,
with the flower of that brave army which stood all the fire at
Fontenoy, will rendezvous at Stone, beyond Litchfield, the day
after to-morrow: Wade is advancing behind them, and will be at
Wetherby in Yorkshire to-morrow.  In short, I have no
conception of their daring to fight either army, nor see any
visible possibility of their not being very soon destroyed.
My fears have been great, from the greatness of our stake; but
I now write in the greatest confidence of our getting over
this ugly business.  We have another very disagreeable affair,
that may have fatal consequences: there rages a murrain among
the cows; we dare not eat milk, butter, beef, nor any thing
from that species.  Unless there is snow or frost soon, it is
likely to @spread dreadfully though hitherto it has not
reached many miles from London.  At first, it was imagined
that the Papists had empoisoned the pools; but the physicians
have pronounced it infectious, and brought from abroad.

I forgot to tell you, that my uncle begged the Duke of
Newcastle to stifle this report of the sham Pretender lest the
King should hear it and recall the Duke, as too great to fight
a counterfeit.  It is certain that the army adore the Duke,
and are gone in the greatest spirits; and on the parade, as
they began their march, the Guards vowed that they would
neither give nor take quarter.  For bravery, his Royal
Highness is certainly no Stuart, but literally loves to be in
the act of fighting.  His brother has so far the same taste,
that the night of his new son's christening, he had the
citadel of Carlisle in sugar at supper, and the company
besieged it with sugar-plums.  It was well imagined,
considering the time and the circumstances.  One thing was
very proper; old Marshal Stair was there, who is grown child
enough to be fit to war only with such artillery.  Another
piece of ingenuity of that court was on the report of Pitt
being named secretary at war.  The Prince hates him, since the
fall of Lord Granville: he said, Miss Chudleigh,(1135) one of
the maids, was fitter for the employment; and dictated a
letter which he made her write to Lord Harrington, to desire
he would draw the warrant for her.  There were fourteen people
at table, and all were to sign it: the Duke of
Queensberry(1136 would not, as being a friend of Pitt, nor
Mrs. Layton, one of the dressers: however, it was actually
sent, and the footman ordered not to deliver it till Sir
William Yonge was at Lord Harrington's-alas! it would be
endless to tell you all his Caligulisms!  A ridiculous thing
happened when the Princess saw company: the new-born babe was
shown in a mighty pretty cradle, designed by Kent, under a
canopy in the great drawing-room.  Sir William Stanhope went
to look at it; Mrs. Herbert, the governess, advanced to
unmantle it; he said, "In wax, I suppose."--"Sir!"--"In wax,
Madam?"--"The young Prince, Sir."--"Yes, in wax, I suppose."
This is his odd humour? when he went to see this duke at his
birth, he said, "Lord! it sees!"

The good Provost of Edinburgh has been with Marshal Wade at
Newcastle, and it is said, is coming to London-he must trust
hugely to the inactivity of the ministry!  They have taken an
agent there going with large contributions from the- Roman
Catholics, who have pretended to be so quiet!  The Duchess of
Richmond, while her husband is at the army, was going to her
grace of Norfolk:(1137) when he was very uneasy at her
intention, she showed him letters from the Norfolk, "wherein
she prays God that this wicked rebellion may be soon
suppressed, lest it hurt the poor Roman Catholics." But this
wise jaunt has made such a noise that it is laid aside.

Your friend Lord Sandwich has got one of the Duke of Montagu's
regiments: he stayed quietly till all the noise was over.  He
is now lord of the admiralty, lieutenant-colonel to the Duke
of Bedford, aide-de-camp to the Duke of Richmond, and colonel
of a regiment!

A friend of mine, Mr. Talbot, who has a good estate in
Cheshire, with the great tithes, which he takes in kind, and
has generally fifteen hundred pounds stock, has expressly
ordered his steward to burn it, if the rebels come that way: I
don't think this will make a bad figure in Mr. Chute's brave
gazette.  As we go on prospering, I will take care to furnish
him with paragraphs, till he kills Riviera(1138) and all the
faction.  When my lovely eagle comes, I will consecrate it to
his Roman memory; don't think I want spirits more than he,
when I beg you to send me a case of drams: I remember your
getting one for Mr. Trevor.

I guessed at having lost two letters from you in the
packet-boat that was taken: I have received all you mention,
but those of the 21st and 28th of September, one of which I
suppose was about Gibberne: his mother has told me how happy
you have made her and him, for which I much thank you and your
usual good-nature.  Adieu! I trust all my letters will grow
better and better.  You must have passed a lamentable scene of
anxiety; we have had a good deal; but I think we grow in
spirits again.  There never was so melancholy a town; no kind
of public place but the playhouses, and they look as if the
rebels had just driven away the company.  Nobody but has some
fear for themselves, for their money, or for their friends in
the army: of this number am I deeply; Lord Bury(1139) and mr.
Conway, two of the first in my list, are aide-de-camps to the
Duke, and another, Mr. Cornwallis,(1140) is in the same army,
and my nephew, Lord Malpas(1141)--so I still fear the rebels
beyond my reason.  Good night.

P. S. It is now generally believed from many circumstances,
that the youngest Pretender is actually among the prisoners
taken on board the Soleil: pray wish Mr. Chute joy for me.

455 Letter 189
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, December 9, 1745.

I am glad I did not write to you last post as I intended; I
should have sent you an account that would have alarmed you,
and the danger would have been over before the letter had
crossed the sea.  The Duke, from some strange want of
intelligence, lay last week for four-and-twenty hours under
arms at Stone, in Staffordshire, expecting the rebels every
moment, while they were marching in all haste to Derby.(1142)
The news of this threw the town into great consternation but
his Royal Highness repaired his mistake, and got to
Northampton, between the Highlanders and London.  They got
nine thousand pounds at Derby, and had the books brought to
them, and obliged every body to give them what they had
subscribed against them.  Then they retreated a few miles, but
returned again to Derby, got ten thousand pounds more,
plundered the town, and burnt a house of the Countess of
Exeter.  They are gone again, and got back to Leake, in
Staffordshire, but miserably harassed, and, it is said, have
left all their cannon behind them, and twenty wagons of
sick.(1143)  The Duke has sent General Hawley with the
dragoons to harass them in their retreat, and despatched Mr.
Conway to Marshal Wade, to hasten his march upon the back of
them.  They must either go to North Wales, where they will
probably all perish, or to Scotland, with great loss.  We
dread them no more We are threatened with great preparations
for a French invasion, but the coast is exceedingly guarded;
and for the people, the spirit against the rebels increases
every day.  Though they have marched thus into the heart of
the kingdom, there has not been the least symptom of a rising,
not even in the great towns of which they possessed
themselves.  They have got no recruits since their first entry
into England, excepting one gentleman in Lancashire, one
hundred and fifty common men, and two parsons, at Manchester,
and a physician from York.  But here in London the aversion to
them is amazing: on some thoughts of the King's going to an
encampment at Finchley, the weavers not Only offered him a
thousand men, but the whole body of the Law formed themselves
into a little army, under the command of Lord Chief-Justice
Willes,(1144) and were to have done duty at St. James's, to
guard the royal family in the King's absence.

But the greatest demonstration of loyalty appeared on the
prisoners being brought to town from the Soleil prize - the
young man is certainly Mr. Radcliffe's son; but the mob,
persuaded of his being the youngest Pretender, could scarcely
be restrained from tearing him to pieces all the way on the
road, and at his arrival.  He said he had heard of English
mobs, but could not conceive they were so dreadful, and wished
he had been shot at the battle of Dettingen, where he had been
engaged.  The father, whom they call Lord Derwentwater, said,
on entering the Tower, that he had never expected to arrive
there alive.  For the young man, he must only be treated as a
French captive; for the father, it is sufficient to produce
him at the Old Bailey, and prove that he is the individual
person condemned for the last rebellion, and so to Tyburn.

We begin to take up people, but it is with as much caution and
timidity as women of quality begin to pawn their Jewels; we
have not ventured upon any great stone yet!

The Provost of Edinburgh is in custody of a messenger; and the
other day they seized an, odd man, who goes by the name of
Count St. Germain.  he has been here these two years, and will
not tell who he is, or whence, but professes that he does not
go by his right name.  He sings, plays on the violin
wonderfully, composes, is mad, and not very sensible.  He is
called an Italian, a Spaniard, a Pole; a somebody that married
a great fortune in Mexico, and ran away with her jewels to
Constantinople; a priest, a fiddler, a vast nobleman, The
Prince of Wales has had unsatiated curiosity about him, but in
vain.  However, nothing has been made out against him -.' he
is released: and, what convinces me that he is not a
gentleman, stays here, and talks of his being taken up for a
spy.

I think these accounts, upon which you may depend, must raise
your spirits, and figure in Mr. Chute's royal journal.-But you
don't get my letters: I have sent you eleven since I came to
town; how many of these have you received? Adieu!

(1142) The consternation was so great as to occasion that day
being named Black Friday.  (Fielding, in his True Patriot,
says, that, "when the Highlanders, by a most incredible march,
got between the Duke's army and the metropolis, they struck a
terror into it scarce to be credited." An immediate rush was
made upon the Bank of England, which,  it is said, only
escaped bankruptcy by paying in sixpences, to gain time.  The
shops in general were shut up; public business, for the most
part, was suspended, and the restoration of the Stuarts was
expected by all as no improbable or distant occurrence.  See
Lord Mahon, vol. iii. p. 444.)

(1143 "Charles arrived at Derby in high spirits, reflecting
that he was now within a hundred and thirty miles of the
capital.  Accordingly, that evening, at supper, he studiously
directed his conversation to his intended progress and
expected triumph--whether it would be best for him to enter
London on foot or on horseback, in Highland or in English
dress.  Far different were the thoughts of his followers, who,
early next morning, laid before him their earnest and
unanimous opinion for an immediate retreat to Scotland,
Charles said, that, rather than go back, he would wish to be
buried twenty feet under ground.  On the following day he
sullenly consented to retreat, but added, that, in future, he
would call no more councils; since he was accountable to
nobody for his actions, excepting to God and his father, and
would therefore no longer either ask or accept their advice."
See Sir Walter Scott's Tales of a Grandfather, vol. v. p. 226.-E.


(1144) Sir John Willes, knight, chief justice of the common
pleas from 1737 to 1762.-D.

(1145) In the beginning of the year 1755, on rumours of a
great armament at Brest, one Virette, a Swiss, who had been a
kind of toad-eater to this St. Germain, was denounced to Lord
Holderness for a spy; but Mr. Stanley going pretty surlily to
his lordship, on his suspecting a friend of his, Virette was
declared innocent, and the penitent secretary of state made
him the honourable amends of a dinner in form.  About the same
time, a spy of ours was seized at Brest, but not happening to
be acquainted with Mr. Stanley, was broken upon the wheel.




457 Letter 190
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington street, Dec. 20, 1745.

I have at last got your great letter by Mr. Gambier, and the
views of the villas,(1146) for which I thank you much.  I
can't say I think them too well done. nor the villas
themselves pretty; but the prospects are charming.  I have
since received two more letters from you, of November 30th and
December 7th.  You seem to receive mine at last, though very
slowly.

We have at last got a spring-tide of good luck.  The rebels
turned back from Derby, and have ever since been flying with
the greatest precipitation.(1147)  The Duke, with all his
horse, and a thousand foot mounted, has pursued them with
astonishing rapidity; and General Oglethorpe, with part of
Wade's horse, has crossed over upon them.  There has been
little prospect of coming up with their entire body, but it
dismayed them; their stragglers were picked up, and the towns
in their way preserved from plunder, by their not having time
to do mischief. This morning an express is arrived from Lord
Malton(1148) in Yorkshire, who has had an account of
Oglethorpe's cutting a part of them to pieces, and of the
Duke's overtaking their rear and entirely demolishing it.  We
believe all this; but, as it is not yet confirmed, don't
depend upon it too much.  The fat East India ships are arrived
safe from Ireland--I mean the prizes; and yesterday a letter
arrived from Admiral Townshend in the West Indies, where he
has fallen in with the Martinico fleet (each ship valued at
eight thousand pounds), taken twenty, sunk ten, and driven
ashore two men-of-war, their convoy, and battered them to
pieces.  All this will raise the pulse Of the stocks, which
have been exceedingly low this week, and the Bank itself in
danger.  The private rich are making immense fortunes out of
the public distress: the dread of the French invasion has
occasioned this.  They have a vast embarkation at Dunkirk; the
Duc de Richelieu, Marquis Fimarcon, and other general
officers, are named in form to command.  Nay, it has been
notified in form by the insolent Lord John Drummond,(1149) who
has got to Scotland, and sent a drum to Marshal Wade, to
announce himself commander for the French King in the war he
designs to wage in England, and to propose a cartel for the
exchange of prisoners.  No answer has been made to this rebel;
but the King has acquainted the Parliament with this audacious
message.  We have a vast fleet at sea; and the main body of
the Duke's army is coming down to the coast to prevent their
landing, if they should slip our ships.  Indeed, I can't
believe they will attempt coming hither, as they must hear of
the destruction of the rebels in England; but they will
probably, dribble away to Scotland, where the war may last
considerably.  Into England, I scarce believe the Highlanders
will be drawn again:--to have come as far as Derby--to have
found no rising in their favour, and to find themselves not
strong enough to fight either army, will make lasting
impressions!

Vernon, I hear, is recalled for his absurdities, and at his
own request, and Martin named for his successor.(1150) We had
yesterday a very remarkable day in the House: the King
notified his having sent for six thousand Hessians into
Scotland.  Mr. Pelham, for an address of thanks.  Lord
Cornbury (indeed, an exceedingly honest man(1151)) was for
thanking for the notice, not for the sending for the troops;
and proposed to add a representation of the national being the
only constitutional troops, and to hope we should be
exonerated of these foreigners as soon as possible.  Pitt, and
that clan, joined him; but the voice of the House, and the
desires of the whole kingdom for all the troops we can get,
were so strong, that, on the division, we were 190 to 44: I
think and hope this will produce some Hanoverians too. That it
will produce a dismission of the Cobhamites is pretty certain;
the Duke of Bedford and Lord Gower arc warm for both points.
The latter has certainly renounced Jacobitism.

Boetslaar is come again from Holland, but his errand not yet
known.  You will have heard of another victory,(1152) which
the Prussian has gained over the Saxons; very bloody on both
sides--but now he is master of Dresden.

We again think that we have got the second son,(1153) under
the name of Macdonald.  Nobody is permitted to see any of the
prisoners.

In the midst of our political distresses, which, I assure you,
have reduced the town to a state of Presbyterian dulness, we
have been entertained with the marriage of the Duchess of
Bridgewater(1154) and Dick Lyttelton - she, forty, plain, very
rich, and with five children; he, six-and-twenty, handsome,
poor, and proper to get her five more.  I saw, the other day,
a very good Irish letter.  A gentleman in Dublin, full of the
great qualities  of my Lord Chesterfield, has written a
panegyric on them, particularly on his affability and
humility; with a comparison between him and the hauteur of all
other lord-lieutenants.  As an instance, he says, the earl was
invited to a great dinner, whither he went, by mistake, at
one, instead of three.  The master was not at home, the lady
not dressed, every thing in confusion.  My lord was so humble
as to dismiss his train and take a hackney-chair, and went and
stayed with Mrs. Phipps till dinner-time--la belle humilit`e!


I am not at all surprised to hear of my cousin Don Sebastian's
stupidity.  Why, child, he cannot articulate; how would you
have had him educated?  Cape Breton, Bastia, Martinico! if we
are undone this year, at least we go out with `eclat.  Good
night.

1146) Villas of the Florentine nobility.

(1147) "Now few there were," says Captain Daniel, in his MS.
Memoirs, " who would go on foot if they could ride; and mighty
taking, stealing, and pressing of horses there was amongst us!
Diverting it was to see the Highlanders mounted, without
either breeches, saddle, or any thing else but the bare back
of the horses to ride on; and for their bridle, only a straw
rope!  in this manner do we march out of England." See Lord
Mahon's Hist. vol. iii. p. 449.-E.

whose death, in 1782, all the titles became extinct.]

officer in the French army.  "The amount of supplies brought
by him reminds us," says Sir Walter Scott, "of those

affording nutriment enough to keep the sufferer from dying,
but not sufficient to restore him to active exertion."]

Paris, 1753. (When Lord Cornbury returned from his travels,
Lord Essex, his brother-in-law, told him, with a great deal of
pleasure, that he had got a handsome pension for him, All Lord
Cornbury's answer was, "How could you tell, my Lord, that I
was to be sold? or, at least, how came you to know my price so
exactly?"--"It was on this account," says Spence, "that Pope
complimented him with this passage-

"Would you be bless't? despise low joys, low gains;
Disdain whatever Cornbury disdains;
Be virtuous, and be happy for your pains."

460 Letter 191
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan, 3, 1746.

I deferred writing to you till I could tell you that the
rebellion was at an end in England.  The Duke has taken
Carlisle, but was long enough before it to prove how basely or
cowardly it was yielded to the rebel: you will see the
particulars' in the Gazette.  His Royal Highness is expected
in town every day; but I still think it probable that he will
go to Scotland.(1155)  That country is very clamorous for it.
If the King does send him, it should not be with that sword of
mercy with which the present family have governed those
people.  All the world agrees in the fitness of severity to
highwaymen, for the sake of the innocent who suffer; then can
rigour be ill-placed against banditti. who have so terrified,
pillaged, and injured the poor people in Cumberland,
Lancashire, Derbyshire, and the counties through which this
rebellion has stalked? There is a military magistrate of some
fierceness sent into Scotland with Wade's army, who is coming
to town; it is General Hawley.(1156)  He will not sow the
seeds of future disloyalty by too easily pardoning the
present.

The French still go on with their preparations at Dunkirk and
their sea-ports; but I think, few people believe now that they
will be exerted against us: we have a numerous fleet in the
Channel, and a large army on the shores opposite to France.
The Dutch fear that all this storm is to burst on them.  Since
the Queen's making peace with Prussia, the Dutch are applying
to him for protection; and I am told, wake from their neutral
lethargy.

We are in a good quiet state here in town; the Parliament is
reposing itself for the holidays; the ministry is in private
agitation; the Cobham part of the coalition is going to be
disbanded; Pitt's wild ambition cannot content itself with
what he had asked, and had granted: and he has driven
Lyttelton and the Grenvilles to adopt all his extravagances.
But then, they are at 'variance again within themselves:
Lyttelton's wife(1157) hates Pitt, and does not approve his
governing her husband and hurting their family; so that, at
present, it seems, he does not care to be a martyr to Pitt's
caprices, which are in excellent training; for he is governed
by her mad Grace of Queensberry.  All this makes foul weather;
but, to me, it is only a cloudy landscape.

The Prince has dismissed Hume Campbell(1158) who was his
solicitor, for attacking Lord Tweedale(1159) on the Scotch
affairs: the latter has resigned the seals of secretary of
state for Scotland to-day.  I conclude, when the holidays are
over, and the rebellion travelled so far back, we shall have
warm inquiries in Parliament.  This is a short letter, I
perceive; but I know nothing more; and the Carlisle part of it
will make you wear, your beaver more erect than I believe you
have of late.  Adieu!

(1155) The Duke of Cumberland entered Carlisle on the 31 st of
December; but his pursuit of the Highlanders in person was
interrupted by despatches, which called him to London, to be
ready to take command against the projected invasion from
France.-E.

(1156) "Hawley," says Lord Mahon, "was an officer of some
experience,
but destitute of capacity, and hated, not merely by his
enemies, but by his own soldiers, for a most violent and
vindictive temper.  One of his first measures, on arriving at
Edinburgh, to take the chief command, was to order two gibbets
to be erected, ready for the rebels who might fall into his
hands; and, with a similar view, he bid several executioners
attend his army on his march." Vol. ii. p. 357.

(1158) twin-brother to the Earl of Marchmont; who, in his
Diary .of the 2d of January, says, "My brother told me he had
been, last night, with Mr. Drax, the Prince's secretary, when
he had notified to him that the Prince expected all his family
to go together to support the measures of the administration,
and that, as Mr. Hume did not act so, he was to write him a
letter, discharging him, In the conversation, Mr. Drax said,
that the Prince was to support the Pelhams, and that his
dismission was to be ascribed to Lord Granville.  My brother
said, that he had nothing to say to the Prince, other than
that he would support all the measures he thought conducive to
the King's interests, but no others."-E.

(1159) The Marquis of Tweedale was one of the discontented
Whigs, during the administration of Sir Robert Walpole; on
whose removal he came to court, and was made secretary of
state, attaching himself to Lord Granville's faction, whose
youngest daughter, Frances, he afterwards married, He was
reckoned a good civilian, but was a very dull man.



461 Letter 192
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 17,1746.,

It is a very good symptom, I can tell you, that I write to you
seldom -. it is a fortnight since my last; and nothing
material has happened in this interval.  The rebels are
intrenching and fortifying themselves in Scotland; and what a
despicable affair is a rebellion upon the defensive! General
Hawley is marched from Edinburgh, to put it quite out.  I must
give you some idea of this man, who will give a mortal blow to
the pride of the Scotch nobility.  He is called Lord chief
Justice; frequent and sudden executions are his passion.  Last
winter he had intelligence of a spy to come from the French
army: the first notice our army had of his arrival, was by
seeing him dangle on a gallows in his mufti and boots.  One of
the surgeons of the army begged the body of a soldier who was
hanged for desertion, to dissect: "Well," said Hawley, "but
then you shall give me the skeleton to hang up in the
guard-room." He is very brave and able; with no small bias to
the brutal.  Two years ago, when he arrived at Ghent, the
magistrates, according to customs sent a gentleman, with the
offer of a sum Of money to engage his favour.  He told the
gentleman, in great wrath, that the King his master paid him,
and that he should go tell the magistrates so; at the same
time dragging him to the head of the stairs, and kicking him
down.  He then went to the town-hall; on their refusing him
entrance, he burst open the door with his foot, and seated
himself abruptly: told them how he had been affronted, was
persuaded they had no hand in it, and demanded to have the
gentleman given up to him, who never dared to appear in the
town while he stayed in it.  Now I am telling you anecdotes of
him, you shall hear two more.  When the Prince of Hesse, our
son-in-law, arrived at Brussels, and found Hawley did not wait
on him, the Prince sent to know if he expected the first
visit?  He replied, "He always expected that inferior officers
should wait on their commanders; and not only that, but he
gave his Highness but half an hour to consider of it." The
Prince went to him.  I believe I told you of Lord John
Drummond sending a drum to Wade to propose a cartel.  Wade
returned a civil answer, which had the King's and council's
approbation.  When the drummer arrived with it at Edinburgh,
Hawley opened it and threw it into the fire, would not let the
drummer go back, but made him write to Lord J. "That rebels
were not to be treated with." If you don't think that spirit
like this will do-do you see, I would not give a farthing for
your presumption.(1160)

The French invasion is laid aside; we are turning our hands to
war again upon the continent.  The House of Commons is
something of which I can give YOU no description: Mr. Pitt,
the meteor of it, Is neither yet in place, nor his friends
out.  Some Tories oppose: Mr. Pelham is distressed, and has
vast majorities.  When the scene clears a little, I will tell
you more of it.

The two last letters I have had from you, are of December 21
and January 4. You was then still in uneasiness; by this time
I hope you have no other distresses than are naturally
incident to your miny-ness.

I never hear any thing of the Countess(1161) except just now,
that she is grown tired of sublunary affairs, and willing to
come to a composition with her lord: I believe that the price
will be two thousand a-year.  The other day, his and her
lawyers were talking over the affair before her and several
other people: her counsel, in the heat of the dispute, said to
my lord's lawyers, "Sir, Sir, we shall be able to prove that
her ladyship was denied nuptial rights and conjugal enjoyments
for seven years." It was excellent! My lord must have had
matrimonial talents indeed, to have reached to Italy; besides,
you know, she made it a point after her son was born, not to
sleep with her husband.

Thank you for the little medal.  I am glad I have nothing more
to tell you-you little expected that we should so soon recover
our tranquility.  Adieu!

(1160) Glover, in his Memoirs, speaks of Hawley with great
contempt, and talks of "his beastly ignorance and negligence,"
which occasioned the loss of the battle of Falkirk.-D.

(1161) Lady Orford.



463 Letter 193
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 28, 1746.

Do they send you the gazettes as they used to do? If you have
them, you will find there an account of another battle lost in
Scotland. Our arms cannot succeed there.  Hawley, of whom I
said so much to you in my last, has been as unsuccessful as
Cope, and by almost every circumstance the same, except that
Hawley had less want of skill and much more presumption.  The
very same dragoons ran away at Falkirk, that ran away at
Preston Pans.(1162)  Though we had seven thousand men, and the
rebels but five, we had scarce three regiments that behaved
well.  General Huske and Brigadier Cholmondeley,(1163) my
lord's brother, shone extremely - the former beat the enemy's.
right wing; and the latter, by rallying two regiments,
prevented the pursuit.  Our loss is trifling: for many of the
rebels fled as fast as the glorious dragoons- but we have lost
some good officers, particularly Sir Robert Monroe; and seven
pieces of cannon.  A worse loss is apprehended, Stirling
Castle, which could hold out but ten days; and that term
expires to-morrow.  The Duke is gone post to Edinburgh, where
he hoped to arrive to-night; if possible, to relieve Stirling.
Another battle will certainly be fought before you receive
this; I hope with the Hessians in it, who are every hour
expected to land in Scotland.  With many other glories, the
English courage seems gone too! The great dependence is upon
the Duke; the soldiers adore him, and with reason: he has a
lion's courage, vast vigilance and activity, and, I am told,
great military genius.  For my own particular, I am uneasy
that he is gone: Lord Bury and Mr. Conway, two of his
aides-de-camp, and brave as he, are gone with him.  The ill
behaviour of the soldiers lays a double obligation on the
officers to set them examples of running on danger.  The
ministry would have kept back Mr. Conway, as being in
Parliament; which when the Duke told him, he burst into tears,
and said nothing should hinder his going--and he is gone!
Judge, if I have not reason to be alarmed!

Some Of our prisoners in Scotland (the former Prisoners) are
returned.  They had the Privilege of walking about the town,
where they were confined, upon their parole: the militia of
the country rose and set them at liberty.  General Hawley is
so strict as to think they should be sent back; but nobody
here comprehends such refinement: they could not give their
word that the town should not be taken.  There are two or
three others, who will lay the government under difficulties,
when we have got over the rebellion.  They were come to
England on their parole; and when the executions begin, they
must in honour be given up--the question indeed will be, to
whom?

Adieu! my dear sir!  I write you this short letter, rather
than be taxed with negligence on such an event; though, YOU
perceive, I know nothing but what you will se in the printed
papers.

P.S. The Hessians would not act, because we would not settle a
cartel with rebels!

(1162) "Hawley was never seen in the field during the battle;
and every thing would have gone to wreck, in a worse manner
than at Preston, if General Huske had not acted with judgment
and courage, and appeared every where." Culloden Papers, p.

464 Letter 194
To Sir Horace MANN.
Arlington Street Feb. 7, 1746.

Till yesterday that I received your last of January 27, I was
very uneasy at finding you still remained under the same
anxiety about the rebellion, when it had so long ceased to be
formidable with us: but you have got all my letters, and are
out of your pain.  Hawley's defeat (or at least what was
called so, for I am persuaded that the victory was ours as far
as there was any fighting, which indeed lay in a very small
compass, the great body of each army running away) will have
thrown you back into your terrors; but here is a letter to
calm you again.  All Monday and Tuesday we were concluding
that the battle between the Duke and the rebels must be
fought, and nothing was talked of but the expectation of the
courier.  He did arrive indeed on Wednesday morning, but with
no battle; for the moment the rebel army saw the Duke's, they
turned back with the utmost precipitation; spiked their
cannon, blew up their magazine, and left behind them their
wounded and our prisoners.  They crossed the Forth, and in one
day fled four-and-thirty miles to Perth, where, as they have
strong intrenchments, some imagine they will wait to fight;
but their desertion is too great; the whole clan of the
macdonalds, one of their best has retired on the accidental
death of their chief.  In short, it looks exceedingly like the
conclusion of this business, though the French have embarked
Fitzjames's regiment at Ostend for Scotland.  The Duke's name
disperses armies, as the Pretender's raised them.

The French seem to be at the eve of taking Antwerp and
Brussels, the latter of which is actually besieged.  In this
case I don't see how we can send an army abroad this summer,
for there will be no considerable towns in Flanders left in
the possession of the Empress-Queen.

The new regiments, of which I told you so much, have again
been in dispute: as their term was near expired, the ministry
proposed to continue them for four months longer.  This was
last Friday, when, as we every hour expected the news of a
conclusive battle, which, if favourable, would render them
useless, Mr. Fox, the general against the new regiments,
begged it might only be postponed till the following
Wednesday, but 170 against 89 voted them that very day.  On
the very Wednesday came the news of the flight of the rebels;
and two days before that, news from Chester of Lord Gower's
new regiment having mutinied, on hearing that they were to be
continued beyond the term for which they had listed.

At court all is confusion-. the King, at Lord Bath's
instigation, has absolutely refused to make Pitt secretary at
war.(1164)  How this will end, I don't know, but I don't
believe in bloodshed: neither side is famous for being
incapable of yielding.

I wish you joy of having the Chutes again, though I am a
little sorry that their bravery was not rewarded by staying at
Rome till they could triumph in their turn: however, I don't
believe that at Florence you want opportunities of exulting.
That Monro you mention was made travelling physician by my
father's interest, who had great regard for the old
doctor.(1165)  if he has any skill in quacking madmen, his art
may perhaps be of service now in the Pretender's court.

I beg my eagle may not come till it has the opportunity of a
man-of-war: we have lost so many merchantmen lately, that I
should never expect to receive it that way.

I can say nothing to your opinion of the young Pretender being
a cheat; nor, as the rebellion is near at end, do I see what
end it would answer to prove him original or spurious.
However, as you seem to dwell upon it, I will mention it again
to my uncle.

I hear that my sister-Countess is projecting her return, being
quite sick of England, where nobody visits her.  She says
there is not one woman of sense in England.  Her journey,
however, will have turned to account, and, I believe, end in
almost doubling her allowance. Adieu! my dear child; love the
Chutes for me as well as for yourself.

(1164) Lord Marchmont, in his Diary of Feb. 9, says, "My
brother told me, that on the ministry insisting on Mr. Pitt
being secretary at war, and the King having said he should not
be his secretary, Lord Bath had gone to the King and told him,
though he had resolved never to take a place, yet now, finding
his ministers would force a servant on him, rather than he
should be so used, he would undertake to get him his money.
The King said. the ministers had the Parliament; Lord Bath
said, his Majesty had it, and not they: and that hereupon the
King thanked him; and it was expected the ministers would all
be out."-E.

(1165) In 1743, Dr. John Monro was appointed, through the
influence of Sir Robert Walpole, to one of the Radcliffe
travelling fellowships.  In 1752, he succeeded his father as
physician to Bridewell and Bethlehem Hospitals.  In 1758, he
published "Remarks on Dr. Battie's Treatise on Madness," in
which he vindicated his father's treatment of that disorder.
He died in 1791.-E.



466 Letter 195
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 14, 1746.

By the relation I am going to make, you will think that I am
describing Turkish, not English revolutions; and will cast
your eye upwards to see if my letter is not dated from
Constantinople.  Indeed, violent as the changes have been,
there has been no bloodshed; no Grand Vizier has had a cravat
made of a bowstring, no Janizaries have taken upon them to
alter the succession, no Grand Signior is deposed--only his
Sublime Highness's dignity has been a little impaired.  Oh! I
forgot; I ought not to frighten you; you will interpret all
these fine allusions, and think on the rebellion--pho! we are
such considerable proficients in politics, that we can form
rebellions within rebellions, and turn a government
topsy-turvy at London, while we are engaged in a civil war in
Scotland.  In short, I gave you a hint last week of an
insurrection in the closet, and of Lord Bath having prevented
Pitt from being secretary at war.  The ministry gave up that
point; but finding that a change had been made in a scheme of
foreign politics, which they had laid before the King, and for
which he had thanked them; and perceiving some symptoms of a
resolution to dismiss them at the end of the session, they
came to a sudden determination not to do Lord Granville's
business by carrying the supplies, and then to be turned out:
so on Monday morning, to the astonishment of every body, the
two secretaries of state threw up the seals; and the next day
Mr. Pelham, with the rest of the Treasury, the Duke of Bedford
with the Admiralty, Lord Gower, privy seal, and Lord
Pembroke,' groom of the stole, gave up too - the Dukes of
Devonshire, Grafton, and Richmond, the Lord Chancellor,
Winnington, paymaster, and almost all the other great officers
and offices, declaring they would do the same.  Lord Granville
immediately received both seals, one for himself, and the
other to give to whom he pleased.  Lord Bath was named first
commissioner of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer;
Lord Carlisle, privy seal, and Lord Winchilsea reinstated in
the Admiralty.  Thus far all went swimmingly; they had only
forgot one little point, which was, to secure a majority in
both Houses: in the Commons they unluckily found that they had
no better man to take the lead than poor Sir John Rushout, for
Sir John Barnard refused to be chancellor of the exchequer; so
did Lord Chief Justice Willes to be lord chancellor; and the
wildness of the scheme soon prevented others, who did not wish
ill to Lord Granville, or well to the Pelhams, from giving in
to it.  Hop, the Dutch minister, did not a little increase the
confusion by declaring that he had immediately despatched a
courier to Holland, and did not doubt but the States would
directly send to accept the terms of France.

I should tell you too, that Lord Bath's being of the
enterprise contributed hugely to poison the success of it.  In
short, his lordship, whose politics were never characterized
by steadiness, found that he had not courage enough to take
the Treasury.  You may guess how ill laid his schemes were,
when be durst not indulge both his ambition and avarice! In
short, on Wednesday morning (pray mind, this was the very
Wednesday after the Monday on which the chance had happened,)
he went to the King, and told him he had tried the House of
Commons, and found it would not do!(1167)  Bounce! went all
the project into shivers, like the vessels in Ben Jonson's
Alchymist, when they are on the brink of the philosopher's
stone.  The poor King, who, from being fatigued with the Duke
of Newcastle, and sick of Pelham's timidity and compromises,
had given in to this mad hurly-burly of alterations, was
confounded with having floundered to no purpose, and to find
himself more than ever in the power of men he hated, shut
himself up in his closet, and refused to admit any more of the
persons who were pouring in upon him with white sticks, and
golden keys, and commissions, etc.  At last he sent for
Winnington, and told him, he was the only honest man about
him, and he should have the honour of a reconciliation, and
sent him to Mr. Pelham to desire they would all return to
their employments.(1168)

Lord Granville is as jolly as ever; laughs and drinks, and
owns it was mad, and owns he -would do it again to-morrow.  It
would not be quite so safe, indeed, to try it soon again, for
the triumphant party are not at all in the humour to be turned
out every time his lordship has drunk a bottle too much; and
that House of Commons that he could not make do for him, would
do to send him to the Tower till he was sober.  This was the
very worst period he could have selected, when the fears of
men had made them throw themselves absolutely into all
measures of Government to secure the government itself; and
that temporary strength of Pelham has my Lord Granville
contrived to fix to him: and people will be glad to ascribe to
the Merit and virtue of the ministry, what they would be
ashamed to Own, but was really the effect of their own
apprehensions.  It was a good idea Of somebody, when no man
would accept a place under the new system, that Granville and
Bath were met going about the streets, calling odd man! as the
hackney chairman do when they want a partner.  This little
faction of Lord Granville goes by the name of the
Grandvillains.

There! who would think that I had written you an entire history
 in the compass of three sides of paper?(1169)  ***Vertot
would have composed a volume on this event. and entitled it,
the Revolutions of England.  You will wonder at not having it
notified to you by Lord Granville himself, as is customary for
new secretaries of state: when they mentioned to him writing
to Italy, he said-"To Italy! no: before the courier can get
thither, I shall be out again."  it absolutely makes one
laugh: as serious as the consequences might be, it is
impossible to hate a politician of such jovial good-humour.  I
am told that he ordered the packet-boat to be stopped at
Harwich till Saturday, till he should have time to determine
what he would write to Holland.  This will make the Dutch
receive the news of the double revolution at the same instant.

Duke and his name are pursuing the scattered rebels into their
very mountains, determined to root out sedition entirely.  It
is believed, and we expect to hear, that the young Pretender
is embarked and gone.  Wish the Chutes joy of the happy
conclusion of this affair!

Adieu! my dear child!  After describing two revolutions, and
announcing the termination of a rebellion, it would be below
the dignity of my letter to talk of any thing of less moment.
Next post I may possibly descend out of my historical buskin,
and converse with you more familiarly--en attendant, gentle
reader, I am, your sincere well-wisher,

Horace Walpole, Historiographer
to the high and mighty Lord John, Earl Granville.

(1166) Henry Herbert, ninth Earl of Pembroke, an intelligent
lover of the arts, and an amateur architect of considerable
merit.  Walpole says of him, in his account of Sculptors and
Architects, The soul of Inigo Jones, who had been patronised
by his ancestors, seemed still to hover over its favourite
Wilton, and to have assisted the Muses of Arts in the
education of this noble person.  No man had a purer taste in
building than Earl Henry, of which he gave a few specimens:
besides his works at Wilton, the new Lodge in Windsor Park;
the Countess of Suffolk's house, at Marble Hill, Twickenham;
the Water-house, in Lord Orford's park at Houghton, are
incontestable proofs of Lord Pembroke's taste: it was more
than taste; it was passion for the utility and honour of his
country that engaged his lordship to promote and assiduously
overlook the construction of Westminster Bridge by the
ingenious M. Lahelye, a man that deserves more notice than
this slight encomium can bestow." He died in January
1750-1.-E.

(1167) "Feb. 13.  Lord Bolingbroke told me, that Bath had
resigned, and all was now over.  He approved of what had been
done, though he owned that Walpole'S faction had done what he
had wrote every King must expect who nurses up a faction by
governing by a party; and that it was a most indecent thing,
and must render the King contemptible.  Lord Cobham told me,
that the King had yesterday sent Winnington to stop the
resignations; that he had offered Winnington the seat of
exchequer, after Bath had resigned it; but Winnington said it
would not do.  At court I met Lord Granville, who is still
secretary, but declared to be ready to resign when the King
pleases." Marchmont Diary.-E.

(1168) In a letter to the Duke of Newcastle, of the 18th, Lord
Chesterfield says, " Your victory is complete: for God's sake
pursue it.  Good policy still more than resentment, requires
that Granville and Bath should be marked-out,'and all their
people cut off.  Every body now sees and knows that you have
the power; let them see and know too, that you will use it.  A
general run ought to be made upon Bath by all your followers
and writers."-E.

(1169) The projectors of this ,attempt to remove the ministers
were overwhelmed with ridicule.  Among other jeux d'esprit,
was "A History of the Long Administration," bound up like the
works printed for children, and sold for a penny; and of which
one would suspect Walpole to be the author.  It concluded as
follows: "And thus endeth the second and last part of this
astonishing administration, which lasted forty-eight hours,
three quarters, seven minutes, and eleven seconds; which may
be truly called the most wise and most Honest of all
administrations, the minister having, to the astonishment of
all wise men, never transacted one rash thing, and, what is
more marvellous, left as much money in the treasury as he
found in it.  This worthy history I have faithfully recorded
in this mighty volume, that it may be read with the valuable
works of our immortal countryman, Thomas Thumb, by our
children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, to the end
of the world:'-E.



469 Letter 196
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 6, 1746.

I know I have missed two or three posts, but you have lost
nothing: you perhaps expected that our mighty commotions did
not subside at once, and that you should still hear of
struggles and more shocks; but it all ended at once; with only
some removals and promotions which you saw in the Gazette.  I
should have written, however, but I have been hurried with my
sister'S(1170) wedding; but all the ceremony of that too is
over now, and the dinners and the visits.

The rebellion has fetched breath; the dispersed clans have
reunited and marched to Inverness, from whence Lord Loudon was
forced to retreat, leaving a garrison in the castle, which has
since yielded without firing a gun.  Their numbers are now
reckoned at seven thousand: old Lord lovat(1171) has carried
them a thousand Frasers.  The French continually drop them a
ship or two: we took two, with the Duke of Berwick's brother
on board: it seems evident that they design to keep up our
disturbances as long as possible, to prevent our sending any
troops to Flanders.  Upon the prospect of the rebellion being
at an end, the Hessians were ordered back, but luckily were
not gone; and now are quartered to prevent the rebels slipping
the Duke, (who is marching to them,) and returning into
England.  This counter-order was given in the morning, and in
the evening came out the Gazette, and said the Hessians are to
go away.  This doubling style in the ministry is grown so
characteristic, that the French are actually playing a farce,
in which harlequin enters, as an English courier, with two
bundles of despatches fastened to his belly and his back: they
ask him what the one is? "Eh! Ces sont mes ordres." and what
the other?  "Mais elles sont mes contre-ordres."

We have been a little disturbed in some other of our politics,
by the news of the King of Sardinia having made his peace: I
think it comes out now that he absolutely had concluded one
with France, but that the haughty court of Spain rejected it:
what the Austrian pride had driven him to, the Spanish pride
drove him from.  You will allow that our affairs are
critically bad, when all our hopes centre in that honest
monarch, the King of Prussia-but so it is: and I own I see
nothing that can restore us to being a great nation but his
interposition.  Many schemes are framed, of making him
Stadtholder of Holland, or Duke of Burgundy in Flanders, in
lieu of the Silesias, or altogether, and that I think would
follow-but I don't know how far any of these have been carried
into propositions.

I see by your letters that our fomentations of the Corsican
rebellion have had no better success than the French tampering
in ours-for ours, I don't expect it will be quite at an end,
till it is made one of the conditions of peace, that they
shall give it no assistance.

The smallpox has been making great havoc in London; the new
Lord Rockingham,(1172) whom I believe you knew when only
Thomas Watson, is dead of it, and the title extinct.  My Lady
Conway(1173) has had it, but escaped.

My brother is on the point of finishing all his affairs with
his countess; she is to have fifteen hundred per year; and her
mother gives her two thousand pounds.  I suppose this will
send her back to you, added to her disappointments in
politics, in which it appears she has been tampering.  Don't
you remember a very foolish knight, one Sir Bourchier
Wrey?(1174)  Well, you do: the day Lord Bath was in the
Treasury, that one day! she wrote to Sir Bourchier at Exeter,
to tell him that now their friends were coming into power, and
it was a brave opportunity for him to Come Up and make his own
terms.  He came, and is lodged in her house, and sends about
cards to invite people to come and see him at the Countess of
Orford's.  There is a little fracas I hear in their domestic;
the Abb`e-Secretary has got one of the maids with child.  I
have seen the dame herself but once these two months, when she
came into the Opera at the end of the first act, fierce as an
incensed turkey-cock, you know her look, and towing after her
Sir Francis Dashwood's new Wife,(1175) a poor forlorn
Presbyterian prude, whom he obliges to consort with her.

Adieu! for I think I have now told you all I know.  I am very
sorry that you are so near losing the good Chutes, but I
cannot help having an eye to myself in their coming to
England.

(1170) Lady Maria Walpole, married to Charles Churchill, Esq.

(1171) Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, a man of parts, but of
infamous character.  He had the folly, at the age of eighty,
to enter into the rebellion, upon a promise from the
Pretender, that he would make him Duke of Fraser.  He was
taken, tried, and beheaded.-D.

)1172) Thomas Watson, third Earl of Rockingham, succeeded his
elder brother Lewis in the family honours in 1745, and died
himself in 1746.  The earldom extinguished upon his death';

Watson Wentworth, Earl of Malton, who was soon afterwards
created Marquis of Rockingham.  ant`e, p. 458, letter 191.

470 Letter 197
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 21, 1746.

I have no new triumphs of the Duke to send you: he has been
detained a great while at Aberdeen by the snows.  The rebels
have gathered numbers again, and have taken Fort Augustus, and
are marching to Fort William.  The Duke complains extremely of
the loyal Scotch: says he can get no intelligence, and reckons
himself more in an enemy's country, than when he was warring
with the French in Flanders.  They profess the big professions
wherever he comes, but, before he is out of sight of any town,
beat up for volunteers for rebels.  We see no prospect of his
return, for he must stay in Scotland while the rebellion
lasts; and the existence of that seems too intimately
connected with the being of Scotland, to expect it should soon
be annihilated.

We rejoice at the victories of the King of Sardinia, whom we
thought lost to our cause.  To-day we are to vote subsidies to
the Electors of Cologne and Mentz.  I don't know whether they
will be opposed by the Electoral Prince;(1176) but he has
lately erected a new opposition, by the councils of Lord Bath,
who has got him from Lord Granville: the latter and his
faction act with the court.

I have told you to the utmost extent of my political
knowledge; of private history there is nothing new.  Don't
think, my dear child, that I hurry over my letters, or neglect
writing to you; I assure you I never do, when I have the least
grain to lap up in a letter: but consider how many chapters of
correspondence are extinct: Pope and poetry are dead!
Patriotism has kissed hands on accepting a place: the Ladies
O. and T.' have exhausted scandal both in their persons and
conversations: divinity and controversy are grown good
Christians, say their prayers and spare their neighbours; and
I think even self-murder is out of fashion.  Now judge whether
a correspondent can furnish matter for the common intercourse
of the post.

Pray what luxurious debauch has Mr. Chute been guilty of, that
he is laid up with the gout? I mean, that he was, for I hope
his fit has not lasted till now.  If you are ever so angry, I
must say, I flatter myself I shall see him before my eagle,
which I beg may repose itself still at Leghorn, for the French
privateers have taken such numbers of our merchantmen, that I
cannot think of suffering it to come that way.  If you should
meet with a good opportunity of a man-of-war, let it come-or I
will postpone my impatience.  Adieu!

P. S. I had sealed my letter, but break it open, to tell you
that an account is just arrived of two of our privateers
having met eight-and- twenty transports going with supplies to
the Brest fleet, and sunk ten, taken four, and driven the rest
on shore.

)1176)  The prince of Wales.



471 Letter 198
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 28, 1746.

I don't at all recollect what was in those two letters of
mine, which I find you have lost: for your sake, as you must
be impatient for English news, I am sorry you grow subject to
these miscarriages but in general, I believe there is little
of consequence in my correspondence.

The Duke has not yet left Aberdeen, for want of his supplies;
but by a party which he sent out, and in which Mr. Conway was,
the rebels do not seem to have recovered their spirits, though
they have recruited their numbers; for eight hundred of them
fled on the first appearance of our detachment, and quitted an
advantageous post.  As much as you know, and as much as you
have lately heard of Scotch finesse, you will yet be startled
at the refinements that nation have made upon their own
policy.  Lord Fortrose,(1177) whose father was in the last
rebellion, and who has himself been restored to his fortune,
is in Parliament and in the army: he is with the Duke-his wife
and his clan with the rebels.  The head of the mackintosh's is
acting just the same part.  The clan of the Grants, always
esteemed the most Whig friendly tribe, have literally in all
the forms signed a neutrality with the rebels.  The most
honest instance I have heard, is in the town of Forfar, there
they have chosen their magistrates; but at the same time
entered a memorandum in their town-book, that they shall not
execute their office "till it is decided which King is to
reign."

The Parliament is adjourned for the Easter holidays.  Princess
Caroline is going to the Bath for a rheumatism.  The countess,
whose return you seem so much to dread, has entertained the
town with an excellent vulgarism.  She happened One night at
the Opera to sit by Peggy Banks,(1178) a celebrated beauty,
and asked her several questions about the singers and dancers,
which the other naturally answered, as one woman of fashion
answers another.  The next morning Sir Bourchier Wrey sent
Miss Banks an opera-ticket, and my lady sent her a card, to
thank her for her civilities to her the night before, and that
she intended to wait on her very soon.  Do but think of Sir B.
Wrey's paying a woman of fashion for being civil to my Lady
O.! Sure no apothecary's wife in a market-town could know less
of the world than these two people!  The operas flourish more
than in any latter years; the composer is Gluck, a German: he
is to have a benefit, at which he is to play on a set of
drinking-glasses, which he modulates with water--I think I
have heard you speak of having seen some such thing.

You will see in the papers long accounts of a most shocking
murder, that has been committed by a lad(1179) on his
mistress, who was found dead in her bedchamber, with an
hundred wounds; her brains beaten out, stabbed, her face,
back, and breasts slashed in twenty places- one hears of
nothing else wherever one goes.  But adieu! it is time to
finish a letter, when one is reduced for news to the
casualties of the week.

(1177) William Mackenzie, fifth Earl of Seaforth, the father
of Kenneth Lord Fortrose, had been engaged in the rebellion of
1715, and was attainted.  He died in 1740.  In consequence of
his attainder, his son never assumed the title of Seaforth,
but continued to be called Lord Fortrose, the second title of
the family. He was member of parliament in 1741 for the burghs
of Fortrose, etc., and in 1747 and 1754, for the county of
Ross, He died in 1762.  His only son, Kenneth, was created
Viscount Fortrose, and Earl of Seaforth in Ireland.-D.

473 Letter 199
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 15, 1746.

Your triumphs in Italy are in high fashion: till very lately,
Italy was scarce ever mentioned as part of the scene of war.
The apprehensions of your great King making his peace began to
alarm us and when we just believed it finished, we have
received nothing but torrents of good news.  The King of
Sardinia(1180) has not only carried his own character and
success to the highest pitch, but seems to have given a turn
to the general face of the war, which has a much more
favourable aspect than was to be expected three months ago,
has made himself as considerable in the scale as the Prussian,
but with real valour, and as great abilities, and without the
infamy, of the other's politics.

The rebellion seems once more at its last gasp; the Duke is
marched, and the rebels fly before him, in the utmost want of
money.  The famous Hazard sloop is taken, with two hundred men
and officers, and about eight thousand pounds in money, from
France.  In the midst of such good news from thence, Mr.
Conway has got a regiment, for which, I am sure, you will take
part in my joy.  In Flanders we propose to make another great
effort, with an army of above ninety thousand men; that is,
forty Dutch, above thirty Austrians, eighteen Hanoverians, the
Hessians, who are to return; and we propose twelve thousand
Saxons, but no English; though, if the rebellion is at all
suppressed in any time, I imagine some of our troops will go,
and the Duke command the whole: in the mean time, the army
will be under Prince Waldeck and Bathiani.  You will wonder at
my running so glibly over eighteen thousand Hanoverians,
especially as they are all to be in our pay, but the nation's
digestion has been much facilitated by the pill given to Pitt,
of vice-treasurer of Ireland.(1181)  Last Friday was the
debate on this subject, when we carried these troops by 255
against 122: Pitt, Lyttelton, three Grenvilles, and Lord
BarringTton, all voting roundly for them, though the eldest
Grenville, two years ago, had declared in the House, that he
would seal it with his blood that he never would give his vote
for a Hanoverian.  Don't you shudder at such perjury? and this
in a republic, and where there is no religion that dispenses
with oaths! Pitt was the only one of this ominous band that
opened his - mouth,(1182) and it was to add impudence to
profligacy; but no criminal at the Place de Greve was ever so
racked as he was by Dr. Lee, a friend of Lord Granville, who
gave him the question both ordinary and extraordinary.

General Hawley has been tried (not in person, you may believe)
and condemned by a Scotch jury for murder, on hanging a spy.
What do you say to this? or what will you say when I tell you,
that Mr. Ratcliffe, who has been so long confined in the
Tower, and supposed the Pretender's youngest son, is not only
suffered to return to France, but was entertained at a great
dinner by the Duke of Richmond as a relation!(1183) The same
Duke has refused his beautiful Lady Emily to Lord
Kildare,(1184) the richest and the first peer of Ireland, on a
ridiculous notion of the King's evil being in the family--but
sure that ought to be no objection: a very little grain more
of pride and Stuartism might persuade all the royal bastards
that they have a faculty of curing that distemper.

The other day, an odd accidental discovery was made; some of
the Duke's baggage, which he did not want, was sent back from
Scotland, with a bill of the contents.  Soon after, -.another
large parcel, but not specified in the bill, was brought to
the captain, directed like the rest.  When they came to the
Custom-house here, it was observed, and they sent to Mr.
Poyntz,(1185) to know what they should do: be bade them open
it, suspecting some trick; but when they did, they found a
large crucifix, copes, rich vestments, beads, and heaps of
such like trumpery, consigned from the titulary primate of
Scotland, who is with the rebels: they imagine, with the
privity of some of the vessels, to be conveyed to somebody
here in town.

Now I am telling you odd events, I must relate one of the
strangest I ever heard.  Last week, an elderly woman gave
information against her maid for coining, and the trial came
on at the Old Bailey.  The mistress deposed, that having been
left a widow several years ago, with four children, and no
possibility of maintaining them, she had taken to coining:
that she used to buy old pewter-pots, out Of each of which she
made as many shillings, etc. as she could put off for three
pounds, and that by this practice she had bred up her
children, bound them out apprentices, and set herself up in a
little shop, by which she got a comfortable livelihood; that
she had now given over coining, and indicted her maid as
accomplice.  The maid in her defence said, "That when her
mistress hired her, she told her that she did something up in
a garret into which she must never inquire: that all she knew
of the matter was, that her mistress had often given her
moulds to clean, which she did, as it was her duty: that,
indeed, she had sometimes seen pieces of pewter-pots cut, and
did suspect her mistress of coining; but that she never had
had, or put off; one single piece of bad money." The judge
asked the mistress if this was true; she answered, "Yes; and
that she believed her maid was as honest a creature as ever
lived; but that, knowing herself in her power, she never could
be at peace; that she knew,-by informing, she should secure
herself; and not doubting but the maid's real innocence would
appear, she concluded the poor girl would come to no harm."
The judge flew into the greatest rage; told her he wished he
could stretch the law to hang her, and feared he could not
bring off the maid for having concealed the crime; but,
however, the jury did bring her in not guilty.  I think I
never heard a more particular instance of parts and villainy.

I inclose a letter for Stosch, which was left here with a
scrap of paper, with these words; "Mr. Natter is desired to
send the letters for Baron de Stosch, in Florence, by Mr. H.
W." I don't know who Mr. Natter(1186) is, nor who makes him
this request, but I desire Mr. Stosch will immediately put an
end to this method of correspondence; for I shall not risk my
letters to you by containing his, nor will I be post to such a
dirty fellow.

Your last was of March 22d, and you mention Madame Suares
illness; I hope she is better, and Mr. Chute's gout better.  I
love to hear of my Florentine acquaintance, though they all
seem to have forgot me; especially the Princess, whom YOU
never mention.  Does she never ask after me? Tell me a little
of the state of her state, her amours, devotions, and
appetite.  I must transcribe a paragraph out of an old book of
letters,(1187) printed in 1660, which I met with-the other
day: "My thoughts upon the reading your letter made me stop in
Florence, and go no farther, than to consider the happiness of
them who live in that town, where the people come so near to
angels in knowledge, that they can counterfeit heaven well
enough to give their friends a taste of it in this life."  I
agree to the happiness of living in Florence, but I am sure
knowledge was not one of its recommendations, which never was
any where it a lower ebb--I had forgot; I beg Dr. Cocchi's
pardon, who is much an exception; how does he do? Adieu!

476 Letter 200
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 25, 1746.

You have bid me for some time send you good news-well! I think
I will.  How good would you have it? must it be a total
victory over the rebels; with not only the Boy, that is here,
killed, but the other, that is not here, too; their whole army
put to the sword, besides -in infinite number of prisoners;
all the Jacobite estates in England confiscated, and all those
in Scotland--what would you have done with them?--or could you
be content with something much under this? how much will you
abate? will you compound for Lord John Drummond, taken by
accident? or for three Presbyterian parsons, who have very
poor livings, stoutly refusing to pay a large contribution to
the rebels? Come, I will deal as well with you as I can, and
for once, but not to make a practice of it, will let you have
a victory! My friend, Lord Bury,(1188) arrived this morning
from the Duke, though the news was got here before him; for,
with all our victory, it was not thought safe to send him
through the heart of Scotland; so he was shipped at Inverness,
within an hour after the Duke entered the town, kept beating
at sea five days, and then put on shore at North Berwick, from
whence he came post in less than three days to London; but
with a fever upon him, for which he had twice been blooded but
the day before the battle; but he is young, and high in
spirits, and I flatter myself will not suffer from this
kindness of the Duke: the King has immediately ordered him a
thousand pound, and I hear will make him his own aide-de-camp.
My dear Mr. Chute, I beg your pardon; I had forgot you have
the gout, and consequently not the same patience to wait for
the battle, with which I, knowing the particulars, postpone
it.

On the 16th, the Duke, by forced marches came up with the
rebels, a little on this side Inverness--by the way, the
battle is not christened yet; I only know that neither
Preston-Pans(1189) nor Falkirk(1190) are to be godfathers.
The rebels, who fled from him after their victory, and durst
not attack him, when so much exposed to them at his
passage(1191) of the Spey, now stood him, they seven thousand,
he ten.  They broke through Barril's regiment, and killed Lord
Robert Kerr,(1192) a handsome young gentleman, who was cut to
pieces with above thirty wounds; but they were soon repulsed,
and fled; the whole engagement not lasting above a quarter of
an hour.  The young Pretender escaped; Mr. Conway, says, he
hears, wounded: he certainly was in the rear. -They have lost
above a thousand men in the engagement and pursuit; and six
hundred were already taken; among which latter are their
French ambassador and Earl Kilmarnock.(1193)  The Duke of
Perth and Lord ogilvie(1194) are said to be slain; Lord
Elcho(1195) was in a salivation, and not there.  Except Lord
Robert Kerr, we lost nobody of note: Sir Robert Rich's eldest
son has lost his hand, and about a hundred and thirty private
men fell.  The defeat is reckoned total, and the dispersion
general: and all their artillery is taken.  It is a brave
young Duke! the town is all blazing round me, as I write, with
fireworks and illuminations - I have some inclination to wrap
up half-a-dozen skyrockets, to make you drink the Duke's
health.  Mr. Doddington, on the first report, came out with a
very pretty illumination; so pretty, that I believe he had it
by him, ready for any occasion.

I now come to a more melancholy theme, though your joy will
still be pure, except from what part you take in a private
grief of mine.  It is the death of Mr. Winnington,(1196) whom
you only knew as One Of the first men in England, from his
parts and from his employment.  But I was familiarly
acquainted with him, loved and admired him, for he had great
good-nature, and a quickness of wit most peculiar to himself:
and for his public talents he has left nobody equal to him, as
before, nobody was superior to him but my father.  The history
of his death is a cruel tragedy, but what, to indulge me who
am full of it, and want to vent the narration, you must hear.
He was not quite fifty, extremely temperate and regular, and
of a constitution remarkably strong, hale and healthy.  A
little above a fortnight ago he was seized with an
inflammatory rheumatism, a common and known case, dangerous,
but scarce ever remembered to be fatal.  He had a strong
aversion to all physicians, and lately had put himself into
the hands of one Thomson, a quack, whose foundation of method
could not be guessed, but by a general contradiction to all
received practice.  This man was the oracle of Mrs.
Masham,(1197) sister, and what one ought to hope she did not
think of, coheiress to Mr. Winnington-. his other sister is as
mad in methodism as this in physic, and never saw him.  This
ignorant wretch, supported by the influence of the sister,
soon made such progress in fatal absurdities, as purging,
bleeding, and starving him, and checking all perspiration,
that his friends Mr. Fox and Sir Charles Williams absolutely
insisted on calling in a physician.  Whom could they call, but
Dr. Bloxholme, an intimate old friend of Mr. Winnington, and
to whose house he always went once a year? This doctor, grown
paralytic and indolent, gave in to every thing the quack
advised: Mrs. Masham all the while ranting and raving  At
last, which at last came very speedily, they had reduced him
to a total dissolution, by a diabetes and a thrush; his
friends all the time distracted for him, but hindered from
assisting him; so far, that the night before he died, Thomson
gave him another purge, though he could not get it all down.
Mr. Fox by force brought Dr. Hulse, but it was too late: and
even then, when Thomson owned him lost, Mrs. Masham was
against trying Hulse's assistance.  In short, madly, or
wickedly, they have murdered(1199) a man to whom nature would
have allotted a far longer period, and had given a decree of
abilities that were carrying that period to so great a height
of lustre, as perhaps would have excelled both ministers, who
in this country have owed their greatness to the greatness of
their merit.

Adieu! my dear Sir; excuse what I have written to indulge my
own concern, in consideration of what I have written to give
you JOY.

P. S. Thank you for Mr. Oxenden; but don't put yourself to any
great trouble, for I desired you before not to mind formal

478 Letter 201
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 16, 1746.

I have had nothing new to tell you since the victory, relative
to it, but that it has entirely put an end to the rebellion.
The number slain is generally believed much greater than is
given out.  Old Tullybardine(1200) has surrendered himself;
the Lords Kilmarnoch, Balmerino,(1201) and Ogilvie(1202) are
prisoners, and coming up to their trials.  The Pretender is
not openly taken, but many people think he is in their power;
however, I dare say he will be allowed to escape; and some
French ships are hovering about the coast to receive him.  The
Duke is not yet returned, but we have amply prepared for his
reception, by settling on him immediately and for ever
twenty-five thousand pounds a-year, besides the fifteen which
he is to have on the King's death.  It was imagined the Prince
would have opposed this, on the reflection that fifteen
thousand was thought enough for him, though heir of the Crown,
and abounding in issue but he has wisely reflected forwards,
and likes the precedent, as it will be easy to find victories
in his sons to reward, when once they have a precedent to
fight with.

You must live on domestic news, for our foreign is exceedingly
unwholesome.  Antwerp is gone;(1203) and Bathiani with the
allied army retired under the cannon of Breda; the junction of
the Hanoverians cut off, and that of the Saxons put off.  We
are now, I suppose, at the eve of a bad peace; though, as Cape
Breton must be a condition, I don't know who will dare to part
with it.  Little Eolus (the Duke of Bedford) says they shall
not have it, that they shall have Woburn(1204) as soon-and I
suppose they will! much such positive patriot politics have
brought on all this ruin upon us! All Flanders is gone, and
all our money, and half our men, and half our navy, because we
would have no search.  Well! but we ought to think on what we
have got too!--we have got Admiral Vernon's head on our signs,
and we are going to have Mr. Pitt at the head of our affairs.
Do you remember the physician in Moli`ere, who wishes the man
dead that he may have the greater honour from recovering him?
Mr. Pitt is paymaster; Sir W. Yonge vice-treasurer of Ireland:
Mr. Fox, secretary-at-war; Mr. Arundel,(1205) treasurer of the
chambers, in the room of Sir John Cotton, who is turned out;
Mr. Campbell (one of my father's admiralty) and Mr. Legge in
the treasury, and Lord Duncannon(1206) succeeds Legge in the
admiralty.

Your two last were of April 19th and 26th.  I wrote one to Mr.
Chute, inclosed to you, with farther particulars of the
battle; and I hope you received @it.  I am entirely against
your sending my eagle while there is any danger.  Adieu! my
dear child! I wrote to-day, merely because I had not written
very lately; but you see I had little to say.

(1200) Elder brother of the Duke of Athol; he was outlawed for
the former rebellion.

boldness, fortitude, and even cheerfulness.-D.'

479 Letter 202
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 22, 1746.

Dear George,
After all your goodness to me, don't be angry that I am glad I
am got into brave old London again: though my cats don't purr
like Goldwin, yet one of them has as good a heart as old
Reynolds, and the tranquillity of my own closet makes me some
amends for the loss of the library and toute la belle
compagnie celestine.  I don't know whether that expression
will do for the azure ceilings; but I found it at my fingers'
ends, and so it slipped through my pen.  We called at
Langley,(1207) but did not like it, nor the Grecian temple at
all; it is by no means gracious.

I forgot to take your orders about your poultry; the partlets
have not laid since I went, for little chanticleer

Is true to love, and all for recreation,
And does not mind the work of propagation.

But I trust you will come Yourself in a few days, and then you
may settle their route.

I am got deep into the Sidney papers, there are old wills full
of bequeathed ovoche and goblets with fair enamel, that will
delight you; and there is a little pamphlet of Sir Philip
Sidney's in defence of his uncle Leicester, that gives me a
much better opinion of his parts than his dolorous Arcadia,
though it almost recommended him to the crown of Poland; at
least I have never been able to discover what other great
merit he had.  In this little tract he is very vehement in
clearing up the honour of his lineage; I don't think he could
have been warmer about his family, if he had been of the blood
of the Cues.(1208)  I have diverted myself with reflecting how
it would have entertained the town a few years ago, if my
cousin Richard Hammond had wrote a treatise to clear up my
father's pedigree, when the Craftsman used to treat him so
roundly 'With being Nobody's son.  Adieu! dear George!

Yours ever,
THE GRANDSON OF NOBODY.

(1207) A seat of the Duke of Marlborough.

(1208) Mr. Montagu used to call his own family the Cues.



480 Letter 203
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, June 5, 1746.

Dear George,
You may perhaps fancy that you are very happy in the country,
and that because you commend every thing you see, you like
every thing: you may fancy that London is a desert, and that
grass grows now where Troy stood; but it does not, except just
before my Lord Bath's door, whom nobody will visit.  So far
from being empty, and dull, and dusty, the town is full of
people, full of water, for it has rained this week, and as gay
as a new German Prince must make any place.  Why, it rains
princes: though some people are disappointed of the arrival of
the Pretender, yet the Duke is just coming and the Prince of
Hesse come.  He is tall, lusty, and handsome; extremely like
Lord Elcho in person, and to Mr. Hussey,(1209) in what
entitles him more to his freedom in Ireland, than the
resemblance of the former does to Scotland.  By seeing him
with the Prince of Wales, people think he looks stupid; but I
dare say in his own country he is reckoned very lively, for
though he don't speak much, he opens his mouth very often.
The King has given him a fine sword, and the Prince a ball.
He dined with the former the first day, and since with the
great officers.  Monday he went to Ranelagh, and supped in the
house; Tuesday at the Opera he sat with his court in the box
on the stage next the Prince, and went into theirs to see the
last dance; and after it was over to the Venetian
ambassadress, who is the only woman he has yet noticed.
To-night there is a masquerade at Ranelagh for him, a play at
Covent Garden on Monday, and a Ridotto at the Haymarket; and
then he is to go.  His amours are generally very humble, and
very frequent; for he does not much affect our daughter.(1210)
A little apt to be boisterous when he has drank.  I have not
heard, but I hope he was not rampant last night with Lady
Middlesex, or Charlotte Dives.(1211)  Men go to see him in the
morning, before he goes to see the lions.

The talk of peace is blown over; nine or ten battalions were
ordered for Flanders the day before yesterday, but they are
again countermanded; and the operations of this campaign again
likely to be confined within the precincts of Covent Garden,
where the army- surgeons give constant attendance.  Major
Johnson commands (I can't call it) the corps de reserve in
Grosvenor Street.  I wish you had seen the goddess of those
purlieus with him t'other night at Ranelagh; you would have
sworn it had been the divine Cucumber in person.

The fame of the Violetta(1212) increases daily; the
sister-Countesses of Burlington and Talbot exert all their
stores of sullen partiality in competition for her- the former
visits her, and is having her picture, and carries her to
Chiswick, and she sups at Lady Carlisle's, and lies--indeed I
have not heard where, but I know not at Leicester House, where
she is in great disgrace, for not going once or twice a week
to take lessons of Denoyer, as he(1213) bid her: you know,
that is politics in a court where dancing-masters are
ministers.

Adieu! dear George: my compliments to all at the farm.  Your
cocks and hens would write to you, but they are dressing in
haste for the masquerade - mind, I don't say that Asheton is
doing any thing like that; but he is putting on an odd sort of
a black gown - but, as Di Bertie says on her message cards,
"mum for that."  Yours ever.

(1209) Edward Hussey, afterwards Earl of Beaulieu.  [He
married Isabella, widow of William, second Duke of Manchester,
the heroine of Sir Charles Hanbury Williams's poem entitled
"Isabella; or, the Morning;" and died in 1802.]

(1210) The Princess Mary, who was married to the Prince of
Hesse Cassel, in 1740.-E.

(1211) Afterwards married to Samuel, second and last Lord
Masham, who died in 1776.-E.

(1212) Afterwards Mrs. Garrick.

(1213) The Prince of Wales; with whom the dancing-master was a
great favourite.



482 Letter 204
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 6, 1746.

It was a very unpleasant reason for my not hearing from you
last post, that you was ill; but I have had a letter from you
since of May 24th, that has made me easy again for your
health: if you was not losing the good Chutes, I should have
been quite satisfied; but that is a loss you will not easily
repair, though I were to recommend you Hobarts(1214) every
day.  Sure you must have had flights of strange awkward
animals, if you can be so taken with him! I shall begin to
look about me, to see the merits of England: he was no
curiosity here; and yet heaven knows there are many better,
with whom I hope I shall never be acquainted.  As I have
cautioned you more than once against minding my recommendatory
letters, (which one gives because one can't refuse them,)
unless I write to you separately, I have no scruple in giving
them.  You are extremely good to give so much credit to my
bills at first sight; but don't put down Hobart to my account;
I used to call him the Clearcake; fat, fair, sweet, and seen
through in a moment.  By what you tell me, I should conclude
the Countess was not returning; for Hobart is not a morsel
that she can afford to lose.

I am much obliged to you for the care you take in sending my
eagle by my commodore-cousin, but I hope it will not be till
after his expedition.  I know the extent of his genius; he
would hoist it overboard on the prospect of an engagement, and
think he could buy me another at Hyde Park Corner with the
prize-money; like the Roman tar that told his crew, that if
they broke the antique Corinthian statues, they should find
new ones.

We have been making peace lately, but I think it is off again;
there is come an unpleasant sort of a letter, transmitted from
Van Hoey(1215) at Paris; it talks something of rebels not to
be treated as rebels, and of a Prince Charles that is
somebody's cousin and friend-but as nobody knows any thing of
this--why, I know nothing of it neither.  There are battalions
ordered for Flanders, and countermanded, and a few less
ordered again - if I knew exactly what day this would reach
 you, I could tell you more certainly, because the
determination for or against is only of every other day.  The
Duke is coming: I don't find it certain, however, that the
Pretender is got off.

We are in the height of festivities for the Serenity of Hesse,
our son-in-law, who passes a few days here on his return to
Germany.  If you recollect Lord Elcho, you have a perfect idea
of his person and parts.  The great officers banquet him at
dinner; in the evenings; there are plays, operas, ridottos,
and masquerades.

You ask me to pity you for losing the Chutes - indeed I do;
and I pity them for losing you.  They will often miss
Florence, and its tranquillity and happy air.  Adieu! Comfort
yourself with what you do not lose.

(1214) The Hon. John Hobart, afterwards second Earl of
Buckinghamshire.  Walpole had given him a letter of
introduction to Sir Horace Mann.-E.

(1215) The Dutch minister at Paris.



483 Letter 205
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, June 12th, 1746.

My dear George,
Don't commend me -. you don't know what hurt it will do me;
you will make me a pains-taking man, and I had rather be dull
Without any trouble.  From partiality to me you won't allow my
letters to be letters.  If you have a mind I should write you
news, don't make me think about it; I shall be so long turning
my periods, that what I tell you will cease to be news.

The Prince of Hesse had a most ridiculous tumble t'other night
at the Opera; they had not pegged up his box tight after the
ridotto, and down he came on all four; George Selwyn says he
carried it off with an unembarrassed countenance.  He was to
go this morning; I don't know whether he did or not.  The Duke
is expected to-night by all the tallow candles and fagots in
town.

Lady Carolina Fitzroy's match is settled to the content of all
parties; they are taking Lady Abergavenny's house in Brook
Street; the Fairy Cucumber houses all Lady Caroline's
out-pensioners; Mr. Montgomery(1216) is now on half pay with
her.  Her Major Johnstone is chosen at White's, to the great
terror of the society.- When he was introduced, Sir Charles
Williams presented Dick Edgecumbe(1217) to him, and said, , I
have three favours to beg of you for Mr. Edgecumbe: the first
is that you would not lie with Mrs. Day; the second, that you
would not poison his cards; the third, that you would not kill
him;" the fool answered gravely, "Indeed I will not."

The Good has borrowed old Bowman's house in Kent, and is
retiring thither for six weeks: I tell her she has lived so
rakish a life, that she is obliged to go and take up.  I hope
you don't know any more of it, and that Major Montagu is not
to cross the country to her.  There--I think you can't commend
me for this letter; it shall not even have the merit of being
one.  My compliments to all your contented family.
Yours ever.

P.S. I had forgot to tell you, that Lord Lonsdale had summoned
the peers to-day to address the King not to send the troops
abroad in the present conjuncture.  I hear he made a fine
speech, and the Duke of Newcastle a very long one in answer,
and then they rose without a division.(1218)  Lord Baltimore
is to bring the same motion into our House.(1219)

(1216) The Honourable Archibald Montgomerie.  He succeeded his
brother as eleventh Earl of Eglinton, in 1769, and died in
1796.-E.

(1217) Richard Edgecumbe, second Lord Edgecumbe.

(1218) 'There was a debate," writes Mr. Pelham to Horatio
Walpole on the 12th, "in the House of Lords this day, upon a
motion of Lord Lonsdale, who would have addressed the King, to
defer the sending abroad any troops till it was more clear
that we are in no danger @ home; which he would by no means
allow to be the case at present.  The Duke of Newcastle spoke
well for one that was determined to carry on the war.
Granville was present, but said nothing. flattered the Duke of
Newcastle when the debate was over, and gave a, strong
negative to the motion."-E.

(1219) Lord Baltimore made his motion in the House of Commons,
on the 18th; when it was negatived by the great majority of
103 against 12.-E.



484 Letter 206
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, June 17, 1746.

Dear George,
I wrote to you on Friday night as soon as I could after
receiving your letter, with a list of the regiments to go
abroad; one of which I hear since, is your brothers.  I am
extremely sorry it is his fortune, as I know the distress it
will occasion in your family.

For the politics which you inquire after, and which may have
given motion to this step, I can give you no satisfactory .  I
have heard that it is in consequence of an impertinent letter
sent over by Van Hoey in favour of the rebels, though at the
same time I hear we are making steps towards a peace.  There
centre all my politics, all in peace.  Whatever your
cousin(1220) may think, I am neither busy about what does
happen, nor making parties for what may.  If he knew how happy
I am, his intriguing nature would envy my tranquillity more
than his suspicions can make him jealous of my practices.  My
books, my virt`u, and my other follies and amusements take up
too much of my time to leave me much leisure to think of other
people's affairs; and of all affairs. those of the public are
least my concern.  You will be sorry to hear of Augustus
Townshend's(1221) death.  I lament it extremely, not much for
his sake, for I did not honour him, but for his poor sister
Molly's, whose little heart, that is all tenderness, and
gratitude, and friendship, will be broke with the shock.  I
really dread it, considering how delicate her health is.  My
Lady Townshend has a son with him.  I went to tell it her.
Instead of thinking of her child's distress, she kept me half
an hour with a thousand histories of Lady Caroline Fitzroy and
Major Johnstone, and the new Paymaster's(1222) m`enage, and
twenty other things, nothing to me, nor to her, if only she
could drop the idea Of the pay of office.

The serene hessian is gone.  Little Brooke is to be an earl.
I went to bespeak him a Lilliputian coronet at
Chenevix's.(1223)  Adieu! dear George.

(1220) George
Dunk, Earl of Halifax.

(1221) Son of Viscount Townshend and Dorothy, sister of Sir
Robert Walpole.  he was a captain in the service of the East
India Company, and died at Batavia, having at that time the
command of the Augusta.-E.

485 Letter 207
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 20, 1746.

We are impatient for letters from Italy, to confirm the news
of a victory over the French and Spaniards-(1224) The time is
critical, and every triumph or defeat material, as they may
raise or fall the terms of peace.  The wonderful letters of
Van Hoey and M. d'Argenson in favour of the rebels, but which,
if the ministry have any spirit, must turn to their harm, you
will see in all the papers.  They have rather put off the
negotiations, and caused the sending five thousand men this
week to Flanders.  The Duke is not yet returned from Scotland,
nor is anything certainly known of the Pretender.  I don't
find any period fixed for the trial of the Lords; yet the
Parliament sits on, doing nothing, few days having enough to
make a House.  Old Marquis Tullibardine, with another set of
rebels are come, amongst whom is Lord Macleod, son of Lord
Cromarty,(1225) already in the Tower. Lady Cromarty went down
incog. to Woolwich to see her son pass by, without the power
of speaking to him: I never heard a more melancholy instance
of affection! Lord Elcho(1226) has written from Paris to Lord
Lincoln to solicit his pardon; but as he has distinguished
himself beyond all the rebel commanders by brutality and
insults and cruelty to our prisoners, I think he is likely to
remain where he is.

Jack Spenser,(1227) old Marlborough's grandson and heir, is
just dead, at the age of six or seven and thirty, and in
possession Of near 30,000 pounds a-year, merely because he
would not be abridged of those invaluable blessings of an
English subject, brandy, small-beer, and tobacco.

Your last letter was of May 31st.  Since you have effectually
lost the good Chutes, I may be permitted to lay out all my
impatience for seeing them.  There are no endeavours I shall
not use to show how much I love them for all their friendship
to you.  You are very kind in telling me how much I am
honoured by their Highnesses Of Modena; but how can I return
it? would it be civil to send them a compliment through a
letter of yours? Do what you think properest for me.

I have nothing to say to Marquis Riccardi about his trumpery
gems, but what I have already said; that nobody here will buy
them together; that if he will think better, and let them be
sold by auction, he may do it most advantageously, for, with
all our distress, we have not at all lost the rage of expense;
but that for sending them to Lisbon, I will by no means do it,
as his impertinent sending them to me without my leave, shall
in no manner draw me into the risk of paying for them.  That,
in short, if he will send any body to me with full authority
to receive them, and to give me the most ample discharge for
them, I will deliver them, and shall be happy so to get rid of
them.  There they lie in a corner of my closet, and will
probably come to light at last with excellent antique mould
about them! Adieu.

(1224) The battle of Placentia, which took place on the 15th
of May.-E.

(1225) George Mackenzie, third Earl of Cromartie, and his
eldest son John, Lord Macleod.  They had been deeply engaged
in the rebellion, were taken prisoners at Dunrobin Castle in
Sutherland, and from thence conveyed to the Tower.  They were,
upon trial, found guilty of high treason; but their lives were
granted to them.  Lord Macleod afterwards entered the Swedish
service.  Lady Cromartie was Isabel, daughter of Sir William
Gordon, of Invergordon, Bart.-D.

(1226) Eldest son of the Earl of Wemyss.

(1227) Brother of Charles Spenser, Earl of Sunderland and Duke
of Marlborough.



486 Letter 208
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, June 24, 1746.

Dear George,
You have got a very bad person to tell you news; for I hear
nothing before all the world has' talked it over, and done
with it.  Till twelve o'clock last night I knew nothing of all
the kissing hands that had graced yesterday morning;
Arundel(1228) for treasurer of the chambers; Legge, and your
friend Walsh Campbell, for the treasury; Lord Duncannon for
the admiralty; and your cousin Halifax (who is succeeded by
his predecessor in the buck hounds) for chief justice in eyre,
in the room of Lord Jersey.  They talk of new earls, Lord
Chancellor, Lord Gower, Lord Brooke, and Lord Clinton; but I
don't know that this will be, because it is not past.

Tidings are every minute expected of a great sea-fight; Martin
has got between the coast and the French fleet, which has
sailed from Brest.  The victory in Italy is extremely big; but
as none of my friends are aide-de-camps there, I know nothing
of the particulars, except that the French and-Spaniards have
lost ten thousand men.

All the inns about town are crowded with rebel Prisoners, and
people are making parties of pleasure, which you know is the
English genius, to hear their trials.  The Scotch, which you
know is the Scotch genius, are loud in censuring the Duke for
his severities in the highlands.

The great business of the town is Jack Spenser's will, who has
left Althorp and the Sunderland estate in reversion to Pitt;
after more obligations and more pretended friendship for his
brother, the Duke, than is conceivable.  The Duke is in the
utmost uneasiness about it, having left the drawing of the
writings for the estate to his brother and his grandmother,
and without having any idea that himself was cut out of the
entail.

I have heard nothing of Augustus Townshend's will: my lady,
who you know hated him, came from the Opera t'other night, and
on pulling off her gloves, and finding her hands all black,
said immediately, "My hands are guilty, but my heart is free."
Another good thing she said, to the Duchess of Bedford,(1229)
who told her the Duke was windbound at Yarmouth, "Lord! he
will hate Norfolk as much as I do."

I wish, my dear George, you could meet with any man that could
copy the beauties in the castle: I did not care if it were
even in Indian ink.  Will you inquire?  Eckardt has done your
picture excellently well.  What shall I do with the original?
Leave it with him till you come?

Lord Bath and Lord Sandys have had their pockets picked at
Cuper's Gardens.  I fancy it was no bad scene, the avarice and
jealousy of their peeresses on their return.  A terrible
disgrace happened to Earl Cholmondeley t'other night at
Ranelagh.  You know all the history of his letters to borrow
money to pay for damask for his fine room at Richmond.  As he
was going in, in the crowd, a woman offered him roses--"Right
damask, my lord!" he concluded she had been put upon it.  I
was told, a-propos, a bon-mot on the scene in the Opera, where
there is a view of his new room, and the farmer comes dancing
out and shaking his purse.  Somebody said there was a
tradesman had unexpectedly got his money.

I think I deal in bon-mots to-day.  I'll tell you now another,
but don't print my letter in a new edition of Joe Miller's
jests.  The Duke has given Brigadier Mordaunt the Pretender's
coach, on condition he rode up to London in it. "That I will,
Sir," said he, "and drive till it stops of its own accord at
the Cocoa Tree."

(1228) The Honourable Richard Arundel, second son to John,
Lord Arundel, of Trerice.  He married, 1732, Lady Frances
Manners, daughter of John, second Duke of Rutland.-E.

(1229) Daughter of John, Earl Gower.



487 Letter 209
To George Montagu,
Arlington Street, July 3, 1746.

My dear George,
I wish extremely to accept your invitation, but I can't bring
myself to it.  If I have the pleasure of meeting Lord
North(1230) oftener-at your house next winter, I do not know
but another summer I may have courage enough to make him a
visit; but I have no notion of going to any body's house, and
have the servants look on the arms of the chaise to find out
one's name, and learn one's face from the Saracen's head.  You
did not tell me how long you stayed at Wroxton, and so I
direct this thither.  I have wrote one to Windsor since you
left it.

The Dew earls have kissed hands, and kept their own titles.
The world reckon Earl Clinton obliged for his new honour to
Lord GranVille, though they made the Duke of Newcastle go in
to ask for it.

Yesterday Mr. Hussey's friends declared his marriage with her
grace of Manchester,(1231) and said he was gone down to
Englefield Green to take possession.

I can tell you another wedding more certain, and fifty times
more extraordinary; it is Lord Cooke with Lady Mary Campbell,
the Dowager of Argyle's youngest daughter.  It is all agreed,
and was negotiated by the Countess of Gower and Leicester.  I
don't know why they skipped over Lady Betty, who, if there
were any question of beauty, is, I think, as well as her
sister.  They drew the girl in to give her consent, when they
first proposed it to her; but now la Belle n'aime pas trop le
Sieur L`eandre.  She cries her eyes to scarlet.  He has made
her four visits, and is so in love, that he writes to her
every other day.  'Tis a strange match.  After offering him to
all the great lumps of gold in all the alleys of the city,
they fish out a woman of quality at last with a mere twelve
thousand pound.  She objects his loving none of her sex but
the four queens in a pack of cards, but he promises to abandon
White's and both clubs for her sake.

A-propos to White's and cards, Dick Edgecumbe is shut up with
the itch.  The ungenerous world ascribes it to Mrs. Day; but
he denies it; owning, however, that he is very well contented
to have it, as nobody will venture on her.  Don't you like
being pleased to have the itch, as a new way to 'keep one's
mistress to one's self!

You will be in town to be sure for the eight-and-twentieth.
London will be as full as at a coronation.  The whole form is
settled for the trials, and they are actually building
scaffolds in Westminster-hall.

I have not seen poor Miss Townshend yet; she is in town, and
better, but most unhappy.

Guilford.  His lordship died in 1790, at the age of

488 Letter 210
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 7, 1746.

I have been looking at the dates of my letters, and find that
I have not written you since the 20th of last month.  As long
as it seems, I am not in fault; I now write merely lest you
should think me forgetful of you, and not because I have any
thing to say.  Nothing great has happened; and for little
politics, I live a good deal out of the way of' them.  I have
no manner of connexion with any ministry, or opposition to
ministry; and their merits and their faults are equally a
secret to me.  The Parliament sitting, so long has worn itself
to a skeleton; and almost every body takes the opportunity of
shortening, their stay in the country, which I believe in
their hearts most are glad to do, by going down, and returning
for the trials, which are to be on the 28th of this month.  I
am of the number; so don't expect to hear from me again till
that aera.

The Duke is still in Scotland, doing his family the only
service that has been done for them there since their
accession.  He daily picks Up notable prisoners, and has
lately taken Lord Lovat, and Murray the secretary.  There are
flying reports of the Boy being killed, but I think not
certain enough for the father(1232) to faint away again-I
blame myself for speaking lightly of the old man's distress;
but a swoon is so natural to his character, that one smiles at
it at first, without considering when it proceeds from
cowardice, and when from misery.  I heard yesterday that we
are to expect a battle in Flanders soon: I expect it with all
the tranquillity that the love of one's country admits, when
one's heart is entirely out of the question, as, thank God!
mine is: not one of my friends will be in it.  I -wish it may
be as magnificent a victory for us, as your giornata di San
Lazaro!

I am in great pain for my eagle, now the Brest fleet is
thought to be upon the coast of Spain: bi-it what do you mean
by him and his pedestal filling three cases? is he like the
Irishman's bird, in two places at once?

Adieu! my dear child; don't believe my love for you in the
least abridged, whenever my letters are scarce or short.  I
never loved you better, and never had less to say, both which
I beg you will believe by my concluding, yours, etc.

P. S. Since I finished my letter, we hear that the French and
Spaniards have escaped from Placentia, not without some
connivance of your hero-king.(1233)  Mons is taken.

(1232) James Stuart, called " The Old Pretender."-D.

(1233) The King of Sardinia.-D.




489 Letter 211
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Aug. 1, 1746.

I am this moment come from the conclusion of the greatest and
most melancholy scene I ever yet saw! you will easily guess it
was the trials of the rebel Lords.  As it was the most
interesting sight, it was the most solemn and fine:
a coronation is a puppet-show, and all the splendour of it
idle; but this sight at once feasted one's eyes and engaged
all one's passions.  It began last Monday; three parts of
Westminster-hall were inclosed with galleries, and hung with
scarlet; and the whole ceremony was conducted with the most
awful solemnity and decency, except in the one point of
leaving the prisoners at the bar, amidst the idle curiosity of
some crowd, and even with the witnesses who had sworn against
them, while the Lords adjourned to their own House to consult.
No part of the royal family was there, which was a proper
regard to the unhappy men, who were become their victims.  One
hundred and thirty-nine lords were present, and made a noble
sight on their benches, frequent and full.  The
Chancellor(1234) was Lord High Steward; but though a most
comely personage with a fine voice, his behaviour was mean,
curiously searching for occasion to bow to the minister(1235)
that is no peer, and consequently applying to the other
ministers, in a manner for their orders; and not even ready at
the ceremonial.  To the prisoners he was peevish; and instead
of keeping up to the humane dignity of the law of England,
whose character it is to point out favour to the criminal, he
crossed them, and almost scolded at any offer they made
towards defence. I had armed myself with all the resolution I
could, whit the thought of their crimes and of the danger
past, and was assisted by the sight of the Marquis
of Lothian(1236) in weepers for his son who fell at Culloden--
but the first appearance of the prisoners shocked me! their
behaviour melted me!  Lord Kilmarnock and Lord Cromartie are
both past forty, but look younger.  Lord Kilmarnock is tall
and slender, with an extreme fine person: his behaviour a most
just mixture between dignity and submission; if in any thing
to be reprehended, a little affected, and his hair too exactly
dressed for a man in his situation; but when I say this, it is
not to find fault with him but to show how little fault there
was to be found.  Lord Cromartie is an indifferent figure,
appeared much dejected, and rather sullen: he dropped a few
tears the first day, and swooned as soon as he got back to his
cell.  For Lord Balmerino, he is the most natural brave old
fellow I ever saw: the highest intrepidity, even to
indifference,.  At the bar he behaved like a soldier and a
man; in the intervals of form, with carelessness and humour.
He pressed extremely to have his wife, his pretty Peggy,(1237)
with him in the tower.  Lady Cromartie only sees her husband
through the grate, not choosing to be shut up with him, as she
thinks she can serve him better by her intercession without:
she is big with child and very handsome; so are their
daughters.  When they were to be brought from the Tower in
separate coaches, there was some dispute in which the axe must
go--old Balmerino cried, "Come, come, put it with me."  At the
bar, he plays with his fingers upon the axe, while he talks to
the gentleman-gaoler; and one day somebody coming up to
listen, he took up the blade and held it like a fan between
their faces.  During the trial, a little boy was near him, but
not tall enough to see; he made room for the child and placed
him near himself.

When the trial began, the two earls pleaded guilty; Balmerino
not guilty, saying he could prove he was not at the taking of
the castle of Carlisle, as was laid in the Indictment.  Then
the King's counsel opened, and Serjeant Skinner pronounced the
most absurd speech imaginable; and mentioned the Duke of
Perth, "who," said he, "I see by the papers is dead."(1238)
Then some witnesses were examined, whom afterwards the old
hero shook cordially by the hand.  The Lords withdrew to their
House, and returning demanded, of the judges, whether one
point not being proved, though all the rest were, the
indictment was false? to which they unanimously answered in
the negative.  Then the Lord High Steward asked the Peers
severally, whether Lord Balmerino @was guilty!  All said,
"guilty upon honour," and then adjourned, the prisoner having
begged pardon for giving them so much trouble.  While the
lords were withdrawn, the Solicitor-General Murray (brother of
the Pretender's minister)1239) officiously and insolently went
up to Lord Balmerino, and asked him, how he could give the
Lords so much trouble, when his solicitor had informed him
that his plea could be of no use to him?  Balmerino asked the
bystanders who this person was! and being told, he said.  "Oh,
Mr. Murray! I am extremely glad to see you; I have been with
several of your relations; the good lady, your mother, was of
great use to us at Perth."  Are not you charmed with this
speech? how just it was! As he went away, he      said, "They
call me Jacobite; I am no more a Jacobite than any that tried
me: but if the Great Mogul had set up his standard, I should
have followed it, for I could not starve."  The worst of his
case is, that after the battle of Dumblain, having a company
in the Duke of Argyll's regiment, he deserted with it to the
rebels, and has since been pardoned.  Lord Kilmarnock is a
Presbyterian, with four earldoms(1240) in him, but so poor
since Lord Wilmington's stopping a pension that my father had
given him, that he often wanted a dinner.  Lord Cromartie was
receiver of the rents of the King's second son in Scotland,
which, it was understood, he should not account for; and by
that means had six hundred a-year from the Government: Lord
Elibank,(1241) a very prating, impertinent Jacobite, was bound
for him in nine thousand pounds, for which the Duke is
determined to sue him.

When the Peers were going to vote, Lord Foley(1242) withdrew,
as too well a wisher; Lord Moray,(1243) as nephew of Lord
Balmerino--and
 Lord Stair--as, I believe, uncle to his great-grandfather.
Lord Windsor,(1244) very affectedly, said, "I am sorry I must
say, guilty upon my honour."  Lord Stamford(1245) would not
answer to the name of Henry, having been christened Harry--
what a great way of thinking on such an occasion! I was
diverted too with old Norsa, the father of my brother's
concubine, an old Jew that kept a tavern; my brother, as
auditor of the exchequer, has a gallery along one whole side
of the court: I said, "I really feel for the prisoners!" old
Issachar replied, "Feel for them! pray, if they had succeeded,
what would have become of all us?"  When my Lady Townshend
heard her husband vote, she said, "I always knew my Lord was
guilty, but I never thought he would own it upon his honour."
Lord Balmerino said, that one of his reasons for pleading not
guilty, was, that so many ladies might not be disappointed of
their show.

On Wednesday they were again brought to Westminster-hall, to
receive sentence; and being asked what they had to say, Lord
Kilmarnock, with a very fine voice, read a very fine speech,
confessing the extent of his crime, but offering his
principles as some alleviation, having his eldest son (his
second unluckily was with him,) in the Duke's army, fighting
for the liberties of his country at Culloden, where his
unhappy father was ? .n arms to destroy them.  He insisted
much on his tenderness to the English prisoners, which some
deny, and say that he was the man who proposed their being put
to death, when General Stapleton urged that he was come to
fight, and not to butcher; and that if they acted any such
barbarity, he would leave them with all his men.  He very
artfully mentioned Van Hoey's letter, and said how much he
should scorn to owe his life to such intercession.  Lord
Cromartie spoke much shorter, and so low, that he was not
heard but by those who sat very near him; but they prefer his
speech to the other.  He mentioned his misfortune in having
drawn in his eldest son, who is prisoner with him; and
concluded with saying, "If no part of this bitter cup must
pass from me, not mine, O God, but thy will be done!"  If he
had pleaded not guilty, there was ready to be produced against
him a paper signed with his own hand, for putting to death the
English prisoners.

Lord leicester went up to the Duke of Newcastle, and said, "I
never heard so great an orator as Lord Kilmarnock; if I was
grace, I would pardon him, and make him paymaster."(1246)
That morning a paper had been sent to the lieutenant of the
Tower for the prisoners; he gave it to Lord Cornwallis,(1247)
the governor, who carried it to the House of Lords.  It was a
plea for the prisoners, objecting that the late act for
regulating the trial of rebels did not take place till after
their crime was committed.  The Lords very tenderly and
rightly sent this plea to them, of which, as you have seen,
the two Earls did not make use; but old Balmerino did, and
demanded council on it.  The High Steward, almost in a
passion, told him, that when he had been offered council, he
did not accept it.  Do but think on the ridicule of sending
them the plea, and then denying them council on it! The Duke
of Newcastle, who never lets slip an opportunity of being
absurd, took it up as a ministerial point, in defence of his
creature the Chancellor; but Lord Granville moved, according
to order, to adjourn to debate in the chamber of Parliament,
where the Duke of Bedford and many others spoke warmly for
their having council; and it was granted.  I said their,
because the plea would have saved them all, and affected nine
rebels who had been hanged that very morning; particularly one
Morgan, a poetical lawyer.  Lord Balmerino asked for Forester
and Wilbraham; the latter a very able lawyer in the House of
Commons, who, the Chancellor said privately, he was sure would
as soon be hanged as plead such a cause.  But he came as
council to-day (the third day), when Lord Balmerino gave up
his plea as invalid, and submitted, without any speech.  The
High Steward then made his, very long and very poor, with only
one or two good passages; and then pronounced sentence!

Great intercession is made for the two Earls: Duke
Hamilton,(1248) who has never been at court, designs to kiss
the King's hand, and ask Lord Kilmarnock's life.  The King is
much inclined to some mercy; but the Duke, who has not so much
of Caesar after a victory, as in gaining it, is for the utmost
severity.  It was lately proposed in the city to
present him with the freedom of some company; one of the
aldermen said aloud, "Then let it be of the Butchers!"(1249)
The Scotch and his Royal Highness are not at all guarded in
their expressions of each other.  When he went to Edinburgh,
in his pursuit of the rebels, they would not admit his guards,
alleging that it was contrary to their privileges; but they
rode in, sword in hand; and the Duke, very justly incensed,
refused to see any of the magistrates.  He came with the
utmost expedition to town, in order for Flanders; but found
that the court of Vienna had already sent Prince Charles
thither, without the least notification, at which both King
and Duke are greatly offended'. When the latter waited on his
brother, the Prince carried him into a room that hangs over
the Wall of St. James's Park, and stood there with his arm
about his neck, to charm the gazing mob

Murray, the Pretender's secretary, has made ample confessions:
the Earl of Traquair(1250 and Dr. Barry, a physician, are
apprehended, and more warrants are out; so much for rebels!
Your friend, Lord Sandwich, is instantly going ambassador to
Holland, to pray the Dutch to build more ships.  I have

494 Letter 212
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Aug. 2, 1746.

Dear George,
You have lost nothing by missing yesterday at the trials, but
a little additional contempt for the High Steward; and even
that is recoverable, as his long, paltry speech is to be
printed; for which, and for thanks for it, Lord Lincoln moved
the House of Lords.  Somebody said to Sir Charles Windham,
"Oh! you don't think Lord Hardwicke's speech good, because you
have read Lord Cowper's."--"No," replied he; "but I do think
it tolerable, because I heard Serjeant Skinner's."(1251)  Poor
brave old Balmerino retracted his plea, asked pardon, and
desired the Lords to intercede for mercy.  As he returned to
the Tower, he stopped the coach at Charing-cross to buy
honey-blobs as the Scotch call gooseberries.  He says he is
extremely afraid Lord Kilmarnock will not behave well.  The
Duke said publicly at his levee, that the latter proposed
murdering the English prisoners.  His Highness was to have
given Peggy Banks a ball last night; but was persuaded to
defer it, as it would have rather looked like an insult on the
prisoners, the very day their sentence was passed.  George
Selwyn says that he had begged Sir William Saunderson to get
him the High Steward's wand, after it was broke, as a
curiosity; but that he behaved so like an attorney the first
day, and so like a pettifogger the second, that he would not
take it to light his fire with; I don't believe my Lady
Hardwicke is so high-minded.

Your cousin Sandwich(1252) is certainly going on an embassy to
Holland.  I don't know whether it is to qualify him, by new
dignity, for the head of the admiralty, or whether (which is
more agreeable to present policy) to satisfy him instead of
it.  I know when Lord Malton,(1253) who was a young earl,
asked for the garter, to stop his pretensions, they made him a
marquis.  When Lord Brooke, who is likely to have ten sons,
though he has none yet, asked to have his barony settled on
his daughters, they refused him with an earldom; and they
professed making Pitt paymaster, in order to silence the
avidity of his faction.

Dear George, I am afraid I shall not be in your neighbourhood,
as I promised myself.  Sir Charles Williams has let his house.
I wish you would one day whisk over and look at Harley House.
The inclosed advertisement makes it sound pretty, though I am
afraid too large for me.  Do look at it impartially: don't be
struck at first sight with any brave old windows; but be so
good as to inquire the rent, and if I can have it for a year,
and with any furniture.  I have not had time to copy out the
verses, but you shall have them soon.  Adieu, with my
compliments to your sisters.

495 Letter 213
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Aug. 5, 1746.

Though I can't this week accept your invitation, I can prove
to you that I am most desirous of passing my time with you,
and therefore en attendant Harley House, if you can find me
out any clean, small house in Windsor, ready furnished, that
is not -,absolutely in the middle of the town, but near you, I
should be glad to take it for three or four months.(1254)  I
have been about Sir Robert Rich's, but they will only sell it.
I am as far from guessing why they send Sandwich in embassy,
as you are; and, when I recollect of what various materials
our late ambassadors have been composed, I can only say, "ex
quovis ligno fit Mercurius."  Murray(1255) has certainly been
discovering, and warrants are out; but I don't yet know who
are to be their prize.  I begin to think that the ministry had
really no intelligence till now.  I before thought they had,
but durst not use it.  A-propos to not daring, I went t'other
night to look at my poor favourite Chelsea,(1256) for the
little Newcastle is gone to be dipped in the sea.  In one of
the rooms is a bed for her Duke, and a press-bed for his
footman; for he never dares lie alone, and, till be was
married, had always a servant to sit up with him.  Lady
Cromartie presented her petition to the King last Sunday.  He
was very civil to her, but would not at all give her any
hopes.  She swooned away as soon as he was gone.(1257)  Lord
Corn-wallis told me that her lord weeps every time any thing
of his fate is mentioned to him.  Old Balmerino keeps up his
spirits to the same pitch of gaiety.  In the cell at
Westminster he showed Lord Kilmarnock how he must lay his
head; bid him not wince, lest the stroke should cut his skull
or his shoulders, and advised him to bite his lips.  As they
were to return, he begged they might have another bottle
together, as they should never meet any more till---, and then
pointed to his neck.  At getting into the coach, he said to
the gaoler, "Take care, or you will break my shins with this
damned axe."(1258)

I must tell you a bon-mot of George Selwyn's at the trial.  He
saw Bethel's(1259) sharp visage looking wistfully at the rebel
lords; he said, What a shame it is to turn her face to the
prisoners till they are condemned."  If you have a mind for a
true foreign idea, one of the foreign ministers said at the
trial to another, "Vraiment cela est auguste."  "Oui," replied
the other, "cela est vrai, mais cela n'est pas royale."  the I
am assured that the old Countess of Errol made her son Lord
Kilmarnock(1260) go into the rebellion on pain of
disinheriting him.  I don't know whether I told you that the
man at the tennis-court protests that he has known him dine at
the man that sells pamphlets at Storey's Gate; "and," says he,
"he would often have been glad if I would have taken him home
to dinner." He was certainly so poor, that in one of his
wife's intercepted letters she tells him she has plagued their
steward for a fortnight for money, and can get but three
shillings.  Can any one help pitying such distress?(1261)  I
am vastly softened, too, about Balmerino's relapse, for his
pardon was only granted him to engage his brother's vote in
the election of Scotch peers.

My Lord Chancellor has got a thousand pounds in present for
his high stewardship, and has @(it the reversion of clerk of
the crown (twelve hundred a-year) for his second son.  What a
long time it will be before his posterity are drove into
rebellion for want, like Lord Kilmarnock!

The Duke gave his ball last night to Peggy Banks at Vauxhall.
It was to pique my Lady Rochford, in return for the Prince of
Hesse.  I saw the company get into their barges at Whitehall
Stairs, as I was going myself, and just then passed by two
city companies in their great barges, who had been a
swan-hopping:.  They laid by and played "God save our noble
King," and altogether it was a mighty pretty show.  When they
came to Vauxhall, there were assembled about five-and-twenty
hundred people, besides crowds without.  They huzzaed, and
surrounded him so, that he was forced to retreat into the
ball-room.  He was very near being drowned t'other night going
from Ranelagh to Vauxhall, and politeness of Lord Cathcart's,
who, stepping on the side of the boat to lend his arm, overset
it, and both fell into the water up to their chins.

I have not yet got Sir Charles's ode;(1262) when I have, you
shall see it: here are my own lines.  Good night!

(1260) The Earl of Kilmarnock was not the son of the Countess
of Errol.  His wife, the Lady Anne Livingstone, daughter of
the Earl of Linlithgow, was her niece, and, eventually, her
heiress.--E.

(1261) The Duke of Argyle, telling him how sorry he was to see
him engaged in such a cause, 'MY Lord,' says be, 'for the two
Kings and their rights, I care not a farthing which prevailed;
but I was starving, and by God, if Mahomet had set up his
standard in the highlands, I had been a good Mussulman for
bread, and stuck close to the party, for I must eat.'" Gray,
vol. 5.-E.

(1262) On the Duchess of Manchester, entitled Isabella, or the
Morning.-E.



497 Letter 214
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Aug. 11, 1746.

Dear George,
I have seen Mr. Jordan, and have taken his house at forty
guineas a-year, but I am to pay taxes.  Shall I now accept
your offer of being at the trouble of giving orders for the
airing of it? I have desired the landlord will order the key
to be delivered to you, and Asheton will assist you.
Furniture, I find, I have in abundance, which I shall send
down immediately; but shall not be able to be at Windsor at
the quivering dame's before to-morrow se'nnight, as the rebel
Lords are not to be executed till Monday.  I shall stay till
that is over, though I don't believe I shall see it.  Lord
Cromartie is reprieved for a pardon.  If wives and children
become an argument for saving rebels, there will cease to be a
reason against their going into rebellion.  Lady Caroline
Fitzroy's execution is certainly to-night.  I dare say she
will follow Lord Balmerino's advice to Lord Kilmarnock, and
not winch.

Lord Sandwich has made Mr. Keith his secretary.  I don't
believe the founder of your race, the great Quu,(1263) of
Habiculeo, would have chosen his secretary from California.

I would willingly return the civilities you laid upon me at
Windsor.  Do command me; in what can I serve you? Shall I get
you an earldom? Don't think it will be any trouble; there is
nothing easier or cheaper.  Lord Hobart and Lord Fitzwilliam
are both to be Earls to-morrow: the former, of Buckingham; the
latter, by his already title.  I suppose Lord Malton will be a
Duke; he has had no new peerage this fortnight.  Adieu! my
compliments to the virtuous ladies, Arabella and Hounsibeloa
Quus.

P. S. Here is an order for the key.


(1263) The Earl of Halifax.-E.



497 Letter 215
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Aug. 12, 1746.

To begin with the Tesi; she is mad if she desires to come
hither.  I hate long histories, and so will only tell you in a
few words, that Lord Middlesex(1264) took the opportunity of a
rivalship between his own mistress, the Nardi, and the
Violette,(1265) the finest and most admired dancer in the
world, to involve the whole m`enage of the Opera in the
quarrel, and has paid nobody; but, like a true Lord of the
Treasury, has shut up his own exchequer.  The principal
man-dancer was arrested for debt; to the composer his Lordship
gave a bad note, not payable in two years, besides amercing
him entirely three hundred pounds, on pretence of his siding
with the Violette.  If the Tesi likes this account-venga!
venga!

Did I tell you that your friend Lord Sandwich was sent'
/ambassador to Holland? He is: and that Lady Charlotte
Fermor(1266) was to be married to Mr. Finch,(1267) the
Vice-chamberlain? She is.  Mr. Finch is a comely black
widower, without children, and heir to his brother Winchilsea,
who has no sons.  The Countess-mother has been in an embroil,
(as we have often known her,) about carrying Miss Shelly, a
bosom-friend, into the Peeresses' place at the trials.  Lord
Granville, who is extremely fond of Lady Charlotte, has given
her all her sister's jewels, to the great discontent of his
own daughters.  She has five thousand pounds, and Mr. Finch
Settles fifteen thousand pounds more upon her.  Now we are
upon the chapter of marriages, Lord Petersham(1268) was last
night married to One Of our first beauties, Lady Caroline
Fitzroy;(1269) and Lord Coke(1270) is to have the youngest of
the late Duke of Argyl@s daughters,)1271) who is none of our
beauties at all.

Princess Louisa has already reached the object of her wish
ever since she could speak, and is Queen of Denmark, We have
been a little lucky lately in the deaths of Kings, and promise
ourselves great matters from the new monarch in Spain.(1272)
Princess Mary is coming over from Hesse to drink the Bath
waters; that is the pretence for leaving her brutal husband,
and for visiting the Duke and Princess Caroline, who love her
extremely.  She is of the softest, mildest temper in the
world.

We know nothing certainly of the young Pretender, but that he
is concealed in Scotland, and devoured with distempers - I
really wonder how an Italian constitution can have supported
such rigours!  He has said, that "he did not see what he had
to be ashamed of; and that if he had lost one battle, he had
gained two."  Old Lovat curses Cope and Hawley for the loss of
those two, and                    says, if they had done their
duty, he had never been in this scrape.  Cope is actually
going to be tried; but Hawley, who is fifty times more
culpable, is saved by partiality: Cope miscarried by
incapacity; Hawley, by insolence and carelessness.

Lord Cromartie is reprieved; the Prince asked his life, and
his wife made great intercession.  Duke Hamilton's
intercession for Lord Kilmarnock has rather hurried him to the
block: he and Lord Balmerino are to die next Monday.  Lord
Kilmarnock, with the greatest nobleness of soul, desired to
have Lord Cromartie preferred to himself for pardon, if there
could be but one saved; and Lord Balmerino laments that
himself and Lord Lovat were not taken at the same time; "For
then," says he, "we might have been sacrificed, and those
other two brave men escaped." Indeed Lord Cromartie does not
much deserve the epithet; for he wept whenever his execution
was mentioned.  Balmerino is jolly with 'his pretty Peggy.
There is a remarkable story of him at the battle of Dunblain,
where the Duke of Argyll, his colonel, answered for him, on
his being suspected.  He behaved well; but as soon as we had
gained the victory, went off with his troop to the Pretender:
protesting that he had never feared death but that day, as he
had been fighting against his conscience.  Popularity has
changed sides since the year '15, for now the city and the
generality are very angry that so Many rebels have been
pardoned.  Some of those taken at Carlisle dispersed papers at
their execution, saying they forgave 'all men but three, the
Elector of Hanover, the pretended Duke of Cumberland, and the
Duke of Richmond, who signed the capitulation at
Carlisle.(1273)

Wish Mr. Hobart joy of ])is new lordship; his father took his
seat to-day as Earl of Buckingham -. Lord Fitzwilliam is made
English earl with him, by his old title.  Lord
TankerVille(1274) goes governor to Jamaica: a cruel method of
recruiting a prodigal nobleman's broken fortune, by sending
him to pillage a province! Adieu!

(1273) A melancholy and romantic incident which took place
amid the terrors of the executions is thus related by Sir
Walter Scott:--"A young lady, of good family and handsome
fortune, who had been contracted in marriage to James Dawson,
one of the sufferers, had taken the desperate resolution of
attending on the horrid ceremonial.  She beheld her lover,
after being suspended for a few minutes, but not till death
(for such was the barbarous sentence), cut down, embowelled,
and mangled by the knife of the executioner.  All this she
supported with apparent fortitude; but when she saw the last
scene, finished, by throwing Dawson's heart into the fire, she
drew her head within the carriage, repeated his name, and
expired on the spot." This melancholy event was made, by
Shenstone, the theme of a tragic ballad:--

"The dismal scene was o'er and past,
The lover's mournful hearse retired;
The maid drew back her languid head,
And, sighing forth his name, expired

"though justice ever must prevail,
The tear my Kitty shed is due;
For seldom shall she hear a tale
So sad, so tender, yet so true."

James Dawson was one of the nine men who suffered at
Kennington, on the 30th Of July.-E.

and five.--E.




500 Letter 216
To George Montagu, Esq,
Arlington Street, Aug. 16, 1746.

Dear George,
I shall be with you on Tuesday night, and since you are so
good as to be my Rowland white, must beg my apartment at the
quivering dame's may be aired for me.  My caravan sets out
with all my household stuff on Monday; but  I have heard
nothing of your sister's hamper, nor do I know how to send the
bantams by it, but will leave them here till I am more settled
under the shade of my own mulberry- tree.

I have been this morning at the Tower, and passed under the
new heads at Temple Bar,(1275) where people make a trade of
letting spying-glasses at a halfpenny a look.  Old Lovat
arrived last night.  I saw Murray, Lord Derwentwater, Lord
Traquair, Lord Cromartie and his son, and the Lord Provost,
-,it their respective windows.  The other two wretched Lords
are in dismal towers, and they have stopped up one of old
Balmerino's windows because he talked to the populace; and now
he has only one, which looks directly upon all the
scaffolding.  They brought in the death-warrant at his dinner.
His wife fainted.  He said, "Lieutenant, with your damned
warrant you have spoiled my lady's stomach." He has written a
sensible letter to the Duke to beg his intercession, and the
Duke has given it to the King; but gave a much colder answer
to Duke Hamilton, who went to beg it for Lord Kilmarnock: he
told him the affair was in the King's hands, and that he had
nothing to do with it.  Lord Kilmarnock, who has hitherto kept
up his spirits, grows extremely terrified.  It will be
difficult to make you believe to what heights of affectation
or extravagance my Lady Townshend carries her passion for my
Lord Kilmarnock, whom she never saw but at the bar of his
trial, and was smitten with his falling shoulders.  She has
been under his windows; sends messages to him; has got his dog
and his snuff-box; has taken lodgings out of town for
to-morrow and Monday night, and then goes to Greenwich;
forswears conversing with the bloody English, and has taken a
French master.  She insisted on Lord Hervey's promising her he
would not sleep a whole night for my Lord Kilmarnock, "and in
return," says she, "never trust me more if I am not as yellow
as a jonquil for him."(1276)  She said gravely t'other day,
"Since I saw my Lord Kilmarnock, I really think no more of Sir
Harry Nisbett than if there was no such man in the world." But
of all her flights, yesterday was the strongest.  George
Selwyn dined with her, and not thinking her affliction so
serious as she pretends, talked rather jokingly of the
execution.  She burst into a flood of tears and rage, told him
she now believed all his father and mother had said of him;
and with a thousand other reproaches flung upstairs.  George
coolly took Mrs. Dorcas, her woman, and made her sit down to
finish the bottle: "And pray, sir," said Dorcas, "do you think
my lady will be prevailed upon to let me go see the execution?
I have a friend that has promised to take care of me, and I
can lie in the Tower the night before." My lady has quarrelled
with Sir Charles Windham for calling the two Lords
malefactors.  The idea seems to be general; for 'tis said Lord
Cromartie is to be transported, which diverts me for the
dignity of the peerage.  The ministry really gave it as a
reason against their casting lots for pardon, that it was
below their dignity.  I did not know but that might proceed
from Balmerino'S not being an earl; and therefore, now their
hand is in, would have them make him one.  You will see in the
papers the second great victory at Placentia.  There are
papers pasted in several parts of the town, threatening your
cousin Sandwich's head if be makes a dishonourable peace.  I
will bring you down Sir Charles Williams's new Ode on the
Manchester.(1277) Adieu!

(1275)  In the sixth volume of "London and its Environs
described," published in 1761, a work which furnishes a
curious view of the state of the metropolis on the accession
of George the Third, it is not only gravely stated of Temple
Bar, that, "since the erection of this gate, it has been
particularly distinguished by having the heads of such as have
been executed for high treason placed upon it," but the
accompanying plate exhibits it as being at that time
surmounted by three such disgusting proofs of the- then
semi-barbarous state of our criminal code.  The following
anecdote, in reference to this exhibition, was related by Dr.
Johnson in 1773:--"I remember once being with Goldsmith in
Westminster Abbey: while we surveyed the Poet's Corner, I said
to him,

'Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur istis.'

When we got to Temple Bar, he stopped me, pointed to the heads
upon it, and slily whispered me,

'Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur ISTIS."'
Life, vol. iii. p. 2@.-E

( 276) "This," says the Quarterly Review, "is an odd
illustration of the truth of the first line in the following
couplet, which begins an epigram ascribed to Johnson:--

'Pitied by gentle minds, Kilmarnock died:
The brave, Balmerino, are on thy side.'"--E.

(1277) Isabel, Duchess of Manchester, married to Edward
Hussey, Esq.-E.



501 Letter 217
To sir Horace Mann.
Windsor, Aug. 21, 1746.

You will perceive by my date that I am got into a new scene,
and that I am retired hither like an old summer dowager; Only
that I have no toad-eater to take the air with me in the back
part of my lozenge-coach, and to be scolded.  I have taken a
small house here within the castle and propose spending the
greatest part of every week here till the parliament meets;
but my jaunts to town will prevent my news from being quite
provincial and marvellous.  Then, I promise you, I will go to
no races nor assemblies, nor make comments upon couples that
come in chaises to the White Hart.

I came from town (for take notice, I put this place upon
myself for the country) the day after the execution of the
rebel Lords: I was not at it, but had two persons come to me
directly who were at the next house to the scaffold; and I saw
another who was upon it, so that you may depend upon my
accounts.

Just before they came out of the Tower, Lord Balmerino drank a
bumper to King James's health.  As the clock struck ten they
came forth on foot, Lord Kilmarnock all in black, his hair
unpowdered in a bag: supported by Forster, the great
Presbyterian, and by Mr. Home a young clergyman, his friend.
Lord Balmerino followed], alone, in a blue coat turned up with
red, his rebellious regimentals, a flannel waistcoat, and his
shroud beneath; their hearses following They were conducted to
a house near the scaffold; the room forwards had benches for
spectators; in the second Lord Kilmarnock was put, and in the
third backwards Lord Balmerino; all three chambers hung with
black.  Here they parted!  Balmerino embraced the other, and
said, "My lord, I wish I could suffer for both!" he had scarce
left him, before he desired again to see him, and then asked
him, "My Lord Kilmarnock, do you know any thing of the
resolution taken in our army, the day before the battle of
Culloden, to put the English prisoners to death?" He replied,
"My lord, I was not present; but since I came hither, I have
had all the reason in the world to believe that there was such
order taken; and I hear the Duke has the pocket-book with the
order." Balmerino answered, "It was a lie raised to excuse
their barbarity to us."-Take notice, that the Duke's charging
this on Lord Kilmarnock (certainly on misinformation) decided
this unhappy man's fate! The most now pretended is, that it
would have come to Lord Kilmarnock's turn to have given the
word for the slaughter, as lieutenant-general, with the patent
for which he was immediately drawn into the rebellion, after
having been staggered by his wife, her mother, his own
poverty, and the defeat of Cope.  He remained an hour and a
half in the house, and shed tears.  At last he came to the
scaffold, certainly much terrified, but with a resolution that
prevented his behaving in the least meanly or unlike a
gentleman.(1278)  He took no notice of the crowd, only to
desire that the baize might be lifted up from the rails, that
the mob might see the spectacle.  He stood and prayed some
time with Forster, who wept over him, exhorted and encouraged
him.  He delivered a long speech to the Sheriff, and with a
noble manliness stuck to the recantation he had made at his
trial; declaring he wished that all who embarked in the same
cause might meet the same fate.  he then took off his bag,
coat and waistcoat with great composure, and after some
trouble put on a napkin-cap, and then several times tried the
block; the executioner, who was in white with a white apron,
out of tenderness concealing the axe behind himself.  At last
the Earl knelt down, with a visible unwillingness to depart,
and after five minutes dropped his handkerchief, the signal,
and his head was cut off at once, only hanging by a bit of
skin, and was received in a scarlet cloth by four of the
undertaker's men kneeling, who wrapped it up and put it into
the coffin with the body; orders having been given not to
expose the heads, as used to be the custom.

The scaffold was immediately new-strewed with saw-dust, the
block new-covered, the executioner new-dressed, and a new axe
brought.  Then came old Balmerino, treading with the air of a
general.  As soon as he mounted the scaffold, he read the
inscription on his coffin, as he did again afterwards: he then
surveyed the spectators, who were in amazing numbers, even
upon masts of ships in the river; and pulling out his
spectacles, read a treasonable speech,(1279) which he
delivered to the Sheriff, and said, the young Pretender was so
sweet a Prince that flesh and blood could not resist following
him; and lying down to try the block, he said, "If I had a
thousand lives, I would lay them all down here in the same
cause." he said, "if he had not taken the sacrament the day
before, he would have knocked down Williamson, the lieutenant
of the Tower, for his ill usage of him.  He took the axe and
felt it, and asked the headsman how many blows he had given
Lord Kilmarnock; and gave him three guineas.  Two clergymen,
who attended him, coming up, he said, "No, gentlemen, I
believe you have already done me all the service you can."
Then he went to the corner of the scaffold, and called very
loud for the warder, to give him his periwig, which he took
off, and put on a nightcap of Scotch plaid, and then pulled
off his coat and waistcoat and lay down; but being told he was
on the wrong side, vaulted round, and immediately gave the
sign by tossing up his arm, as if he were giving the signal
for battle.  He received three blows, but the first certainly
took away all sensation.  He was not a quarter of an hour on
the scaffold; Lord Kilmarnock above half a one.  Balmerino
certainly died with the intrepidity of a hero, but with the
insensibility of one too.(1280)  As he walked from his prison
to execution, seeing every window and top of house filled with
spectators, he cried out, "Look, look, how they are all piled
up like rotten oranges!"

My Lady Townshend, who fell in love -with Lord Kilmarnock at
his trial, will go nowhere to dinner, for fear of meeting with
a rebel- pie; she says, every body is so bloody-minded, that
they eat rebels!  The Prince of Wales, whose intercession
saved Lord Cromartie, says he did it in return for old Sir
William Gordon, Lady Cromartie's father, coming down out of
his deathbed to vote against my father in the Chippenham
election.(1281)  If his Royal Highness had not countenanced
inveteracy like that of Sir Gordon he would have no occasion
to exert his gratitude now in favour of rebels.  His brother
has plucked a very useful feather out of the cap of the
ministry, by forbidding any application for posts in the army
to be made to any body but himself: a resolution I dare say,
he will keep as strictly and minutely as he does the
discipline and dress of the army.  Adieu!

P. S. I have just received yours of Aug. 9th.  You had not
then heard of the second great battle of Placentia, which has
already occasioned new instructions, or, in effect, a recall,
being sent after Lord Sandwich.

(1278) "When," says Sir Walter Scott, in Tales of a
Grandfather, "he beheld the fatal scaffold, covered with black
cloth; the executioner with his axe and his assistants; the
saw-dust which was soon to be drenched with his blood; the
coffin prepared to receive the limbs which were yet warm with
life; above all, the immense display of human countenances
which surrounded the scaffold like a sea, all eyes being bent
on the sad object of the preparation, his natural feelings
broke forth in a whisper to the friend on whose arm he leaned,
'Home, this is terrible!' No sign of indecent timidity,
however, affected his behaviour."-E.

(1279) Ford, in his account, states that " so far was this
speech from being filled with passionate invective, that it
mentioned his Majesty as a Prince of the greatest magnanimity
and mercy, at the same time that, through erroneous 'political
principles, it denied him a right to the allegiance of his
people."-E.

(1280) He once more turned to his friends and took his last
farewell, and looking on the crowd, said, 'Perhaps some may
think my behaviour too bold; but remember, Sir,' said he to a
gentleman who stood near him, 'that I now declare it is the
effect of confidence in God, and a good conscience, and I
should dissemble if I should show any signs of fear.'"
Ford.-E.

504 Letter 218
To Sir Horace Mann.
Windsor, Sept. 15, 1746.

You have sent me Marquis Rinuncini with as much secrecy as if
you had sent me a present.  I was here; there came an
exceedingly fair written and civil letter from you, dated last
May: I comprehended by the formality of it, that it was
written for the person who brought it, not for the person it
was sent to.  I have been to town on purpose to wait on him,
and though you know he was not of my set, yet being of
Florence and recommended by you, and recollecting how you used
to cuddle over a bit of politics with the old Marquis,(1282) I
set myself to be wondrous civil to Marquis Polco; pray, faites
valoir ma politesse!(1283)  You have no occasion to let people
know exactly the situation of my villa; but talk of my
standing in campagnaz and coming directly in sedia di posta,
to far mio dovere al Signor Marchesino.  I stayed literally an
entire week with him, carried him to see palaces and Richmond
gardens and park, and Chenevix's shop, and talked a great deal
to him alle conversationi.  It is a wretched time for him;
there is not a soul in town; no plays; and Ranelagh shut up.
You may say I should have stayed longer with him.  but I was
obliged to return for fear of losing my vintage.  I shall be
in London again in a fortnight, and then I shall do more mille
gentilezzes.  Seriously, I was glad to see him-after I had got
over being sorry to see him, (for with all the goodness of
one's Soquckin soqubut, as the Japanese call the heart, YOU
must own it is a little troublesome to be showing the tombs,)
I asked him a thousand questions, rubbed up my old tarnished
Italian, and inquired about fifty people that I had entirely
forgot till his arrival.  He told me some passages, that I
don't forgive you for not mentioning; your Cicisbeatura, Sir,
with the Antinora;(1284) and Manelli's(1285) marriage and
jealousy: who consoles my illustrious mistress?(1286)
Rinuncini has announced the future arrival of the Abbate
Niccolini, the elder Pandolfini, and the younger Panciatici;
these two last, you know, were friends of mine; I shall be
extremely glad to see them.

Your two last were of Aug. 23d and 30th.  In the latter you
talk of the execution of the rebel lords, but don't tell me
whether you received my long history of their trials.  Your
Florentines guessed very rightly about my Lady O."s reasons
for not returning amongst you: she has picked up a Mr.
Shirley,(1287) no great genius--but with all her affectation
of parts, you know she never was delicate about the capacity
of her lovers.  this swain has so little pretensions to any
kind of genius, that two years ago being to act in the Duke of
Bedford's company,(1288) he kept back the play three weeks,
because he could not get his part by heart, though it
consisted but of seventeen lines and a half.  With him she has
retired to a villa near Newpark, and lets her house in town.

Your last letter only mentions the progress of the King of
Sardinia towards Genoa; but there is an account actually
arrived of his being master of it.  It is very big new-,, and
I hope will make us look a little haughty again: we are giving
ourselves airs, and sending a secret expedition against
France: we don't indeed own that it is in favour of the
Chevalier William Courtenay,(1289) who, you know, claims the
crown of France, and whom King William threatened them to
proclaim, when they proclaimed the Pretender; but I believe
the Protestant Highlanders in the south of France are ready to
join him the moment he lands.  There is one Sir Watkin
Williams, a great Baron in languedoc, and a Sir John Cotton, a
Marquis of Dauphin`e,(1290) who have engaged to raise a great
number of men, on the first debarkation that we make.

I think it begins to be believed that the Pretender's son is
got to France - pray, if he passes through Florence, make it
as agreeable to him as you can, ,ind introduce him to all my
acquaintance.  I don't indeed know him myself, but he is a
particular friend of my cousin, Sir John Philipps,(1291) and
of my sister-in-law Lady O., who will both take it extremely
kindly--besides, do for your own sake you may make your peace
with her this way; and if ever Lord Bath comes into power, she
will secure your remaining at florence.  Adieu!

(1282) Marquis Rinuncini, the elder, had been envoy in
England, and prime minister to John Gaston, the last Great
duke.

(1283) Grey, in a letter to Wharton of the 11th, says, "Mr.
Walpole has taken a house in Windsor, and I see him usually

Florentine, the Marquis Rinuncini, who comes recommended to
him." Works, vol. iii. @. 9.-E.

506 Letter 219
To sir Horace Mann.
Windsor, Oct. 2,1746.

By your own loss YOU may measure My joy at the receipt of the
dear Chutes.(1292) I strolled to town one day last week, and
there I found them!  Poor creatures! there they were!
wondering at every thing they saw, but with the difference
from Englishmen that go abroad, O keeping their amazement to
themselves.  They will tell you of wild dukes in the
playhouse, of streets dirtier than forests, and of women more
uncouth than the streets.  I found them extremely surprised at
not finding any ready-furnished palace built round two courts.
I do all I can to reconcile their country to them; though
seriously they have no affectation, and have nothing
particular in them, but that they have nothing particular: a
fault, of which the climate and their neighbours will soon
correct.  You may imagine how we have talked you over, and how
I have inquired after the state of your Wetbrownpaperhood.
Mr. Chute adores you: do you know, that as well as I love you,
I never found all those charms in you that he does! I own this
to you out of pure honesty, that you may love him as much as
he deserves.  I don't know how he will succeed here, but to me
he has more wit than any body I know: he is altered, and I
think, broken: Whitehed is grown leaner considerably, and is a
very pretty gentleman.(1293)  He did not reply to me as the
Turcotti(1294) did bonnement to you when you told her she was
a little thinner: do you remember how she puffed and chuckled,
and said, "And indeed I think you are too."  Mr. Whitehed was
not so sensible of the blessing of decrease, as to conclude
that it would be acceptable news even to shadows: he thinks me
plumped out.  I would fain have enticed them down hither, and
promised we would live just as if we were at the King's Arms
in via di Santo Spirito:(1295) but they were obliged to go
chez eux, not pour se d`ecrasser, but pour se crasser.  I
shall introduce them a tutte le mie conoscenze, and shall try
to make questo paese as agreeable to them as possible; except
in one point, for I have sworn never to tell Mr. Chute a word
of news, for then he will be writing it to you, and I shall
have nothing to say.  This is a lucky resolution for you, my
dear child, for between two friends one generally hears
nothing; the one concludes that the other has told all.

I have had two or three letters from you since I wrote.  The
young Pretender is generally believed to have got off the 18th
of last month: if he were not, with the zeal of the Chutes, I
believe they would be impatient to send a limb to Cardinal
Acquaviva and Monsignor Piccolomini.  I quite gain a winter
with them, having had no expectation of them till spring'.
Adieu!

(1292) John Chute and Francis Whitehed had been several years
in Italy, chiefly at Florence.

(1293) Gray, in a letter to Mr. Chute, written at this time,
thus describes Mr. Whithead:

"He is a fine young personage in a coat all over spangles,
just come over from the tour in Europe to take possession and
be married.  I desire my hearty congratulations to him, and
say I wish him more spangles, and more estates, and more
wives." Works, vol. iii. p. 20.-E.

(1294) A fine singer.

their door.



507 Letter 220
To the Hon. H. S. Conway.
Windsor still, Oct. 3, 1746.

My dear Harry,
You ask me if I have really grown a philosopher.  Really I
believe not: for I shall refer you to my practice rather than
to my doctrine, and have really acquired what they only
pretended to seek, content.  So far, indeed I was a
philosopher even when I lived in town, for then I was content
too; and all the difference I can conceive between those two
opposite doctors was, that Aristippus loved London, and
Diogenes Windsor; and if your master the Duke, whom I
sincerely prefer to Alexander, and who certainly can intercept
more sunshine, would but stand out of my way, which he is
extremely in, while he lives in the park here,(1296) I should
love my little tub of forty pounds a-year, more than my palace
dans la rue des ministers, with all my pictures and bronzes,
which you ridiculously imagine I have encumbered myself with
in my solitude.  Solitude it is, as to the tub itself, for no
soul lives in it with me; though I could easily give you room
at the butt end of it, and with -vast pleasure; but George
Montagu, who perhaps is a philosopher too, though I am sure
not of Pythagoras's silent sect, lives but two barrels off;
and Asheton, a Christian philosopher of our acquaintance,
lives -,it the foot of that hill which you mention with a
melancholy satisfaction that always attends the reflection. A-
propos, here is an Ode on the very subject, which I desire you
will please to like excessively:(1297)
****************

 You will immediately conclude, out of good breeding, that it
is mine, and that it is charming.  I shall be much obliged to
you for the first thought, but desire you will retain only the
second; for it is Mr. Gray's, and not your humble servant's.

(1296) " The Duke of Cumberland is here at his lodge with
three women, and three aide-de-camps; and the country swarms
with people.  He goes to races and they make a ring about him
as at a bear-baiting." Gray to Wharton, Sept. 11. Works, vol.
iii. p. 10.-E.

(1297) Here follows, in the original Mr. Gray's Ode on a,
distant prospect of Eton College.  [This, which was the first
English production of Gray which appeared in print, was
published by Dodsley in the following year.  Dr. Warton says,
that " little notice was taken of it, on its first
publication."-E.




508 Letter 221
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Oct. 14, 1746.

You will have been alarmed with the news of another
battle(1298)  lost in Flanders, where we have no Kings of
Sardinia.  We make light of it; do not allow it to be a
battle, but call it "the action near Liege." then, we have
whittled down our loss extremely, and will not allow a man
more than three hundred and fifty English slain out of the
four thousand.  The whole of' it, as It appears to me, is,
that we gave up eight battalions to avoid fighting; as at
Newmarket people pay their forfeit when they foresee they
should lose the race; though, if the whole army had fought,
and we had lost the day, one might have hoped to have come off
for eight battalions.  Then they tell you that the French had
four-and-twenty-pounders, and that they must beat us by the
superiority of their cannon; so that to me it is grown a
paradox, to war with a nation who have a mathematical
certainty of beating you; or else it is a still stranger
paradox, why you cannot have as large cannon as the French.
This loss was balanced by a pompous account of the triumphs of
our invasion of Bretagne; which, in plain terms, I think, is
reduced to burning two or three villages and reimbarking: at
least, two or three of the transports are returned with this
history, and know not what is become of Lestock and the rest
of the invasion.  The young Pretender is landed in France,
with thirty Scotch, but in such a wretched condition that his
Highland Highness had no breeches.(1299)

I have received yours of the 27th of last month, with the
capitulation of Genoa, and the kind conduct of the Austrians
to us their allies, so extremely like their behaviour whenever
they are fortunate. Pray, by the way, has there been any talk
of my cousin,(1300) the Commodore, in letting slip some
Spanish ships'!-don't mention it as from me, but there are
whispers of court-martial on him.  They are all the fashion
now; if you miss a post to me, I will have you tried by a
court-martial.  Cope is come off most gloriously, his courage
ascertained, and even his conduct, which every body had given
up, justified.  Folkes and Lascelles, two of his generals, are
come off too; but not so happily in the opinion of the world.
Oglethorpe's sentence is not yet public, but it is believed
not to be favourable.  He was always a bully, and is now tried
for cowardice.  Some little dash of the same sort is likely to
mingle withe the judgment on il furibondo Matthews; though his
party rises again a little, and Lestock's acquittal begins to
pass for a party affair.  In short, we are a wretched people,
and have seen our best days.

I must have lost a letter, if you really told me of the sale
of the Duke of Modena's pictures,(1301) as you think you did;
for when Mr. Chute told it me, it struck me as quite new.
They are out of town, good souls; and I shall not see them
this fortnight; for I am here only for two or three days, to
inquire after the battle, in which not one of my friends were.
Adieu!

(1299) About the 18th of September, Prince Charles received
intelligence that two French frigates had arrived at
Lochnannagh, to carry him and other fugitives of his party to
France: accordingly, after numerous wanderings in various
disguises he embarked, on the 20th of September, attended by
Lochiel, Colonel Roy Stuart, and about a hundred others of the
relics of his party; and safely landed at the little port of
Roscoff, near
 Morlaix, in Brittany, on the 29th.  " During these
wanderings," says Sir Walter Scott, in Tales of a Grandfather,
"the secret of the Adventurer's concealment was intrusted to
hundreds, of every sex, age, and condition; but no individual
was found, in a high or low situation, or robbers even , who
procured their food at the risk of their lives, who thought
for an instant of obtaining opulence at the expense of
treachery to the proscribed and miserable fugitive.  Such
disinterested conduct will reflect honour on the Highlands of
Scotland while their mountains shall continue to exist." Prose

509 Letter 222
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Windsor, Oct. 24, 1746.

Well, Harry, Scotland is the last place on earth I should have
thought of for turning any body poet: but I begin to forgive
it half its treasons in favour of your verses, for I suppose
you don't think I am the dupe of the highland story that you
tell me: the only use I shall make of it is to commend the
lines to you, as if they really were a Scotchman's.  There is
a melancholy harmony in them that is charming, and a delicacy
in the thoughts that no Scotchman is capable of, though a
Scotchwoman(1302 might inspire it.  I beg, both for Cynthia's
sake and my own, that you would continue your De Tristibus
till I have an opportunity of seeing your muse, and she of
rewarding her: Reprens ta musette, berger amoureux!  If
Cynthia has ever travelled ten miles in fairy-land, she must
be wondrous content with the person and qualifications of her
knight, who in future story will be read of thus: Elmedorus
was tall and perfectly well made, his face oval, and features
regularly handsome, but not effeminate; his complexion
sentimentally brown, with not much colour; his teeth fine, and
forehead agreeably low, round which his black hair curled
naturally and beautifully.  His eyes were black too, but had
nothing of fierce or insolent; on the contrary, a certain
melancholy swimmingness, that described hopeless love rather
than a natural amorous languish.  His exploits in war, where
he always fought by the side of the renowned Paladine William
of England, have endeared his memory to all admirers of true
chivalry, as the mournful elegies which he poured out among
the desert rocks of Caledonia,(1303) in honour of the peerless
lady and his
heart's idol, the incomparable Cynthia, will for ever preserve
his name in the flowery annals of poesy.

What a pity it is I was not born in the golden age of Louis
the Fourteenth, when it was not only the fashion to write
folios, but to read them too! or rather , it is a pity the
same fashion don't subsist NOW, when one need not be at the
trouble of invention, nor of turning the whole Roman history
into romance for want of proper heroes.  Your campaign in
Scotland, rolled out and well be-epitheted, would make a
pompous work, and make one's fortune; at sixpence a number,
one should have all the damsels within the liberties for
subscribers: whereas now, if one has a mind to be read, one
must write metaphysical poems in blank verse, which, though I
own to be still easier, have not half the imagination of
romances, and are dull without any agreeable absurdity.  Only
think of the gravity of this wise age, that have exploded
"Cleopatra and Pharamond," and approve "The Pleasures of the
Imagination," "The Art of Preserving Health," and "Leonidas!"
I beg the age's pardon: it has done approving these poems, and
has forgot them.

Adieu! dear Harry.  Thank you seriously for the poem.  I am
going to town for the birthday, and shall return hither till
the Parliament meets; I suppose there is no doubt of our
meeting then.  Yours ever.

P.S. Now you are at Stirling, if you should meet with
Drummond's history of the five King Jameses, pray look it
over.(1304)  I have read it, and like it much.  It is wrote in
imitation of Livy; the style is masculine, and the whole very
sensible; only he ascribes the misfortunes of one reign to the
then king's loving architecture and

"In trim gardens taking pleasure."

(1302) Caroline Campbell, Countess of Ailesbury.-E.

(1303) Mr. Conway was now in Scotland.

(1304) Drummond of Hawthorne's History of Scotland, from 1423
to 1542, did not appear until after his death.  This work, in
which the doctrine of unlimited authority and passive
obedience is advocated to an extravagant extent, is generally
considered to have added little to his reputation.  He died in
December 1649, in his sixty-fourth year.
Ben Jonson is said to have so much admired the genius of this
"Scotian Petrarch," as to travel on foot to Scotland, out of
love and respect for him.-E.



510 Letter 523
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Nov. 3, 1746.

Dear George,
Do not imagine I have already broken through all my wholesome
resolutions and country schemes, and that I am given up body
and soul to London for the winter.  I shall be with you by the
end of the week; but just now I am under the maiden
palpitation of an author.  My epilogue will, I believe, be
spoken to-morrow night;(1305) and I flatter myself I shall
have no faults to answer for but what are in it, for I have
kept secret whose it is.  It is now gone to be licensed; but
as the Lord Chamberlain is mentioned,(1306)' though rather to
his honour, it is possible it may be refused.

Don't expect news, for I know no more than a newspaper.
Asheton would have written it if there were any thing to tell
you.  Is it news that my Lord Rochford is an oaf? He has got a
set of plate buttons for the birthday clothes, with the Duke's
head in every one.  Sure my good lady carries her art too far
to make him so great a dupe. How do all the comets?  Has Miss
Harriet found out any more ways at solitaire? Has Cloe left
off evening prayer on account of the damp evenings?  How is
Miss Rice's cold and coachman?  Is Miss Granville better? Has
Mrs. Masham made a brave hand of this bad season, and lived
upon carcases like any vampire? Adieu!  I am just going to see
Mrs. Muscovy,(1307) and will be sure not to laugh if my old
lady should talk of Mr. Draper's white skin, and tickle his
bosom like Queen Bess.

(1305) Rowe's tragedy of Tamerlane was written in compliment
to William the Third, whose character the author intended to
display under that of Tamerlane, as he meant to be understood
to draw that of Louis the Fourteenth in Bajazet.  Tamerlane
was always acted on the 4th and 5th of November, the
anniversaries of King William's birth and landing; and this
year Mr. Walpole had written an epilogue for it, on the
suppression of the rebellion.-E.

511 Letter 224
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 4, 1746.

Mr. Chute and I a,,reed not to tell you of any new changes
till we could tell you more of them, that you might not be
"put into a taking," as you was last winter with the
revolution of three days; but I think the present has ended
with a single fit.  Lord Harrington,(1308) quite on a sudden,
resigned the seals; it is said, on some treatment not over-
gracious; but he is no such novice to be shocked with that,
though I believe it has been rough ever since his resigning
last year, which he did more boisterously than he is
accustomed to behave to Majesty.  Others talk of some quarrel
with his brother secretary, who, in complaisance, is all for
drums and trumpets.  Lord Chesterfield was immediately named
his successor; but the Duke of Newcastle has taken the
northern provinces, as of more business, and consequently
better suited to his experience and abilities!  I flatter
myself that this can no way affect you.  Ireland is to be
offered to Lord Harrington, or the Presidentship; and the Duke
of Dorset, now President, is to have the other's refusal.  The
King has endured a great deal with your old complaint; and I
felt for him, recollecting all you underwent.

You will have seen in the papers all the histories of our
glorious expeditions(1309) and invasions of France, which have
put Cressy and Agincourt out of all countenance.  On the first
view, indeed, one should think that our fleet had been to
victual; for our chief prizes were cows and geese and turkeys.
But I rather think that the whole was fitted out by the Royal
Society, for they came back quite satisfied with having
discovered a fine bay! Would one believe, that in the year of
our Lord one thousand seven hundred and forty-six, we should
boast of discovering something on the coast of France, as if
we had found out the Northeast passage, or penetrated into
some remote part of America? The Guards are come back too, who
never went: in one Single day they received four several
different orders!

Matthews is broke at last.  Nobody disputes the justice of the
sentence; but the legality of it is not quite so
authenticated.  Besides some great errors in the forms,
whenever the Admiralty perceived any of the court-martial
inclined to favour him, they were constantly changed.  Then,
the expense has been enormous; two hundred thousand pounds!
chiefly by employing young captains, instead of old half-pay
officers; and by these means, double commissions.  Then there
has been a great fracas between the court-martial and
Willes.(1310)  He, as Chief Justice, sent a summons in the
ordinary form of law, to Mayerne, to appear as an evidence in
a trial where a captain had prosecuted Sir Chaloner Ogle for
horrid tyranny: the ingenious court-martial sat down and drew
up articles of impeachment, like any House of Commons, against
the Chief Justice for stopping their proceedings! and the
Admiralty, still more ingenious, had a mind to complain of him
to the house! He was charmed to catch them at such
absurdities--but I believe at last it is all compromised.

I have not heard from you for some time, but I don't pretend
to complain: you have real occupation; my idleness is for its
own sake.  The Abb`e Niccolini and Pandolfini are arrived; but
I have not yet seen them.  Rinuncini cannot bear England--and
if the Chutes speak their mind, I believe they are not
captivated yet with any thing they have found: I am more and
more with them: Mr. Whithed is infinitely improved: and Mr.
Chute has absolutely more Wit, knowledge, and good-nature,
than, to their great surprise, ever met together in one
man.(1311) he has a bigotry to you, that even astonishes me,
who used to think that I was pretty well in for loving you;
but he is very often ready to quarrel with me for not thinking
you all pure gold.  Adieu!

(1308) William Stanhope, Earl of Harrington, secretary of
state.

(1309) The expedition to Quiberon; the troops under General
St. Clair, the fleet under Admiral Lestock.  The object was to
surprise Port l'Orient, and destroy the stores and ships of
the French East India Company, but the result attained was
only the plunder and burning of a few helpless villages.  The
fleet and troops returned, however, with little loss.  "The
truth is," says Tindal, "Lestock was too old and infirm for
enterprise, and, as is alleged, was under the shameful
direction of a woman he carried along with him; and neither
the soldiers nor the sailors seem to have been under any kind
of discipline."-E.

(1310) John Willes, Lord Chief Justice of the Common
Pleas(1311) Grey, in a letter to Mr. Chute of the 12th of
October says, "Mr.  Walpole is full, I assure you, of your
panegyric.  Never any man had half so much wit as Mr. Chute,
(which is saying every thing with him, you know,) and Mr.
Whitehead is the finest young man that was ever imported."

513 Letter 225
To Sir Horace Mann.
Windsor, Nov. 12, 1746.

Here I AM come hither, per saldare; but though the country is
excellently convenient, from the idleness of it, for beginning
a letter, yet it is not at all commode for finishing one: the
same ingredients that fill a basket by the carrier, will not
fill half a sheet of paper; I could send you a cheese, or a
hare; but I have not a morsel of news.  Mr. Chute threatened
me to tell you the distress I was in last week, when I starved
Niccolini and Pandolfini on a fast-day, when I had thought to
banquet them sumptuously.  I had luckily given a guinea for
two pine-apples, which I knew they had never seen in Italy,
and upon which they revenged themselves for all the meat that
they dared not touch.  Rinuncini could not come.  How you
mistook me, my dear' child! I meant simply that you had not
mentioned his coming; very far from reproving you for giving
him a letter.  Don't I give letters for you every day to cubs,
ten times cubber than Rinuncini! and don't you treat them as
though all their names were Walpole? If you was to send me all
the uncouth productions of Italy, do you think any of them
would be so brutal as Sir William Maynard?  I am exactly like
you; I have no greater pleasure than to make them value your
recommendation, by showing how much I value it.  Besides, I
love the Florentines for their own sakes and to indemnify
them, poor creatures! a little for the Richcourts, the
Lorraines, and the Austrians.  I have received per mezzo di
Pucci,(1312) a letter from Marquis Riccardi, with orders to
consign to the bearer all his treasure in my hands, which I
shall do immediately with great satisfaction.  There are four
rings that I should be glad he would sell me; but they are
such trifles, and he will set such a value on them the moment
he knows I like them, that it is scarce worth while to make
the proposal, because I would give but a little for them.
However, you may hint what plague I have had with his roba,
and that it will be a gentillezza to sell me these four dabs.
One is a man's head, small, on cornelian, and intaglio; a fly,
ditto; an Isis, cameo; and an inscription in Christian Latin:
the last is literally not worth two sequins.

As to Mr. Townshend, I now know all 'the particulars, and that
Lord SandWich(1313) was at the bottom of it.  What an
excellent heart his lordship will have by the time he is
threescore, if he sets out thus!  The persecution(1314) is on
account of the poor boy's relation to my father; of whom the
world may judge pretty clearly already, from the abilities and
disinterestedness of such of his enemies as have succeeded;
and from their virtue in taking any opportunity to persecute
any Of his relations; in which even the public interest of
their country can weigh nothing, when clashing with their
malice.  The King of Sar dinia has written the strongest
letter imaginable to complain of the grievous prejudice the
Admiralty has don@his affairs by this step.

Don't scold me for not sending you those Lines to
Eckardt:(1315) I never wrote any thing that I esteemcd less,
or that was seen so incorrect ; nor can I at all account for
their having been so much liked,
 especially as the thoughts were so old and so common.  I was
hurt at their getting into print.  I enclose you an
epilogue(1316) that I hae vwritten since, merely for a
specimen of something more correct.  You know, or have known,
that Tamerlane is always acted on King William's birthday,
with an occasional prologue ; this was the epilogue to it, and
succeeded to flatter me.  Adieu!

514 Letter 226
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec. 5, 1746.

We are in such a newsless situation, that I have been some
time without writing to you; but I now answer one I received
from you yesterday.  You will excuse me, if I am not quite so
transported as Mr. Chute is, at the extremity of
Aquaviva.(1317)  I can't afford to hate people so much at such
a distance: my aversions find employment within their own
atmosphere.

Rinuncini returns to you this week, not at all contented with
England: Niccolini is extremely, and turns his little talent
to great account; there is nobody of his own standard but
thinks him a great genius.  The Chutes and I deal extremely
together; but they abuse me, and tell me I am grown so
English! lack-a-day! so I am; as folks that have been in the
Inquisition, and did not choose to broil, come out excellent
Catholics.

I have been unfortunate in my own family; my nephew, Captain
Cholmondeley,(1318) has married a player's sister; and I fear
Lord Malpas(1319) is on the brink of matrimony with another
girl of no fortune.  Here is a ruined family! their father
totally undone, and all be has seized for debt!

The Duke is gone to Holland to settle the operations of the
campaign, but returns before the opening of it.  A great
reformation has been made this week in the army; the horse are
broke, and to be turned into dragoons, by which sixty thousand
pounds a-year will be  saved.  Whatever we do in Flanders, I
think you need not fear any commotions here, where Jacobitism
seems to have gasped its last.  Mr. Radcliffe, the last
Derwentwater's brother, is actually named to the gallows for
Monday; but the imprudence of Lord Morton,(1320) who has drawn
himself into the Bastile, makes it doubtful whether the
execution will be so quick.  The famous orator Henley is taken
up for treasonable flippancies.(1321)

You know Lord Sandwich is minister at the Hague.  Sir Charles
Williams, who has resigned the paymastership of the marines,
is talked of for going to Berlin, but it is not yet done.  The
Parliament has been most serene, but there is a storm in the
air: the Prince waits for an opportunity of erecting his
standard, and a disputed election between him and the
Grenvilles is likely very soon to furnish the occasion.  We
are to have another contest about Lord Bath's borough,(1322)
which Mr. Chute's brother formerly lost, and which his
colleague, Lu@e Robinson, has carried by a majority of three,
though his competitor is returned.  Lord Bath wrote to a man
for a list of all that would be against him: the man placed
his own and his brother's names at the head of the list.

We have operas, but no company at them; the Prince and Lord
Middlesex Impresarii.  Plays only are in fashion: at one house
the best company that perhaps ever were together, quin,
Garrick, Mrs. Pritchard, and Mrs. Cibber: at the other, Barry,
a favourite young actor, and the Violette, whose dancing our
friends don't like; I scold them, but all the answer is,
"Lord! you are so English!" If I do clap sometimes when they
don't, I can fairly say with Oedipus,

"My hands are guilty, but my heart is free."

515 Letter 227
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Christmas-day, 1746.

We are in great expectation of farther news from Genoa, which
the last accounts left in the greatest confusion, and I think
in the hands of the Genoese;,(1323) a circumstance that may
chance to unravel all the fine schemes in Provence! Marshal
Bathiani, at the Hague, treated this revolt as a trifle; but
all the letters by last post make it a reconquest.  The Dutch
do all the Duke asks: we talk of an army of 140,000 men in
Flanders next campaign.  I don't know how the Prince of Orange
relishes his brother-in-law's dignities and success.

Old Lovat has been brought to the bar of the House of Lords:
he is far from having those abilities for which he has been so
cried up.  He saw Mr. Pelham at a distance and called to him,
and asked him if it were worth while to make all this fuss to
take off a gray head fourscore years old?  In his defence he
complained of his estate being seized and kept from him.  Lord
Granville took up this complaint very strongly, and insisted
on having it inquired into.  Lord Bath went farther, and, as
some people think, intended the Duke; but I believe he only
aimed at the Duke of Newcastle, who was so alarmed with this
motion, that he kept the House above a quarter of an hour in
suspense, till he could send for Stone,(1324) and consult what
he should do.  They made a rule to order the old creature the
profits of his estate till his conviction.  He is to put in
his answer the 13th of January.

Lord Lincoln is cofferer at last, in the room of Waller,(1325)
who is dismissed.  Sir Charles Williams has kissed hands, and
sets out for Dresden in a month: he has hopes of Turin, but I
think Villettes is firm.  Don't mention this.

Did I ever talk to you of a Mr. Davis, a Norfolk gentleman,
who has taken to painting? He has copied the Dominichin, the
third picture he ever copied in his life: how well, you may
judge; for Mr. Chute, who, I believe you think, understands
pictures if any body does, happened to come in, just as Mr.
Davis brought his copy hither.  "Here," said I, "Mr. Chute,
here is your Dominichin come to town to be copied." He
literally did not know it; which made me very happy for Mr.
Davis, who has given me this charming picture.  Do but figure
to yourself a man of fifty years old, who was scarce ever out
of the county of Norfolk, but when his hounds led him; who
never saw a tolerable picture till those at Houghton four
years ago who plays and composes as well as he paints, and who
has no more of the Norfolk dialect than a Florentine!  He is
the most decent, sensible man you ever saw.

Rinuncini is gone: Niccolini sups continually with the Prince
of Wales, and learns the Constitution!  Pandolfini is put
to-bed, like children, to be out of the way.  Adieu!


P. S. My Lady O. who has entirely settled her affairs with my
brother, talks of going abroad again, not being able to live
here on fifteen hundred pounds a-year--many an old 'lady, and
uglier too, lives very comfortably upon less.  After I had
writ this, your brother brought me another letter with a
confirmation of all we had heard about Genoa.  You may be easy
about the change of provinces,(1326) which has not been made
as was designed.  Echo Mons`u Chute

>From Mr. Chute.

Mr. Walpole gives me a side, and I catch hold of it to tell
you that I parted this minute with your charming brother, who
has been in the council with me about your grand affair:(1327)
it is determined now to be presented to the King by way of
memorial; and to-morrow we meet again to draw it up: Mr. Stone
has graciously signified that this is a very proper
opportunity - one should think he must know.

Oh! I must tell you: I was here last night, and saw my Lord
Walpole,(1328) for the first time, but such a youth! I declare
to you, I was quite astonished at his sense and cleverness; it
is impossible to describe it; it was just what would have made
you as happy to observe as it did me: he is not yet seventeen,
and is to continue a year longer at Eton, upon his own desire.
Alas! how few have I seen of my countrymen half so formed even
at their return from their travels! I hope you will have him
at Florence One day or other; he will pay you amply for the
Pigwiggins, and------

Mr. Walpole is quite right in all he tells you of the miracle
worked by St. Davis, which certainly merits the credit of
deceiving far better judges of painting than I; who am no
judge of any thing but you, whom I pretend to understand
better than any body living and am, therefore, my dear sir,
etc. etc. etc.  J. C.

(1323) This circumstance is thus alluded to in a letter of Sir
Horace Mann's, dated Dec. 20th, 1746.  "The affairs of Genoa
are in such a horrid situation, that one is frightened out of
one's senses.  The accounts of them are so confused, that one
does not know what to make of them; but it is certain that the
mob is quite master of the town and of every thing in it.
They have sacked several houses, particularly that of the
Doge, and five or six others, belonging to those who were the
principal authors of the alliance which the Republic made with
France and Spain."-D.

517 Letter 228
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 27, 1747.

The Prince has formally declared a new Opposition which is
never to subside till he is King (s'entendent that he does not
carry his point sooner.) He began it pretty handsomely the
other day with 143 to 184, which has frightened the ministry
like a bomb.  This new party wants nothing but heads; though
not having any, to be sure the struggle is the fairer.  Lord
Baltimore(1329) takes the lead; he is the best and honestest
man in the world, with a good deal of jumbled knowledge; but
not capable of conducting a party. However, the next day, the
Prince, to reward him, and to punish Lord Archibald Himllton,
who voted with the ministry, told Lord Baltimore that he would
not give him the trouble of waiting any more as Lord of the
Bedchamber.  but would make him Cofferer.  Lord B. thanked
him, but desired that it might not be done in a way
disagreeable to Lord Archibald, who was then Cofferer. The
Prince sent for Lord Archibald, and told him he would either
make him Comptroller, or give him a pension of twelve hundred
pounds a-year; the latter of' which the old soul accepted, and
went away content; but returned in an hour with a letter from
his wife,(1330) to say, that as his Royal Highness was angry
with her husband, it was not proper for either of them to take
their pensions.  It is excellent! When she was dismissed
herself, she accepted the twelve hundred pounds, and now will
not let her husband, though he had accepted.  It must mortify
the Prince wondrously to have four-and-twenty hundred pounds
a-year thrown back into an exchequer that never yet
overflowed!

I am a little piqued at Marquis Riccardi's refusing me such a,
trifle as the four rings, after all the trouble I have had
with his trumpery!  I think I cannot help telling him, that
Lord Carlisle and Lord Duncannon, Who heard of his collection
from Niccolini, have seen it; and are willing, at a reasonable
price, to take it between them: if you let me know the lowest,
and in money that I understand, not his equivocal pistoles, I
will allow so much to Florence civilities, as still to help
him off with his goods, though he does not deserve it; as
selling me four rings could not have affected the general
purchase.  I pity your Princess Strozzi(1331) but cannot
possibly hunt after her chattels: Riccardi has cured me of
Italian merchandise, by forcing it upon me.'

Your account of your former friend's neglect of you does not
at all surprise me: there is an inveteracy, a darkness, a
design and cunning in his character that stamp him for a very
unamiable young man: it is uncommon for a heart to be so
tainted so early My cousin's(1332) affair is entirely owing to
him;(1333) nor can I account for the pursuit of such
unprovoked revenge.

I never heard of the advertisement that you mention to have
received from Sir James Grey,(1334) nor believe it was ever in
the House of Commons; I must have heard of it.  I hear as
little of Lady O. who never appears; nor do I know if she sees
Niccolini: he lives much with Lady Pomfret (who has married
her third daughter),(1335) and a good deal with the Prince.

Adieu! I have answered your letter, and have nothing more to
put into mine.

after having behaved very bravely, gave so perplexed an
account of his own conduct, that the Admiralty thought it
necessary to have it examined; but the inquiry proved much to
his honour.

519 Letter 229
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 23, 1747.

Why, you do nothing but get fevers! I believe you try to dry
your Wet-brown-paperness, till you scorch it.  Or do you play
off fevers against the Princess's coliques?  Remember, hers
are only for the support of her dignity, and that is what I
never allowed you to have: you must(1336) have twenty unlawful
children, and then be twenty years in devotion, and have
twenty unchristian appetites and passions all the while,
before you may think of getting into a cradle with
`epuisements and have a Monsieur Forzoni(1337) to burn the
wings of boisterous gnats-pray be more robust-do you hear!

One would think you had been describing our Opera, not your
own; we have just set out with one in what they call, the
French manner, but about as like it, as my Lady Pomfret's hash
of plural persons and singular verbs or infinitive moods was
to Italian.  They sing to jigs, and dance to church music -.
Phaeton is run away with by horses that go a foot's-pace, like
the Electress's(1338) coach, with such long traces, that the
postilion was in one street and the coachman in another;--then
comes Jupiter with a farthing-candle to light a squib and a
half, and that they call fire-works.  Reginello, the first
man, is so old and so tall, that he seems to have been growing
ever since the invention of operas.  The first woman has had
her mouth let out to show a fine set of teeth, but it lets out
too much bad voice at the same time.(1339)  Lord Middlesex,
for his great prudence in having provided such very tractable
steeds to Prince Phaeton's car, is going to be Master of the
Horse to the Prince of Wales; and for his excellent economy in
never paying the performers, is likely to continue in the
treasury.  The two courts grow again: and the old question of
settling the 50,000 pounds a-year talked of.  The Tories don't
list kindly under this new Opposition; though last week we had
a warm day on a motion for inquiring into useless places and
quarterings.  Mr. Pitt was so well advised as to acquit my
father pretty amply, in speaking Of the Secret Committee.  My
uncle Horace thanked him in a speech, and my brother Ned has
been to visit him-Tant d'empressement, I think, rather shows
an eagerness to catch any opportunity of paying court to him;
for I do not see the so vast merit in owning now for his
interest, what for his honour he should have owned five years
ago.  This motion was spirited up by Lord Bath, who is raving
again, upon losing the borough of Heydon: from which last week
we threw his brother-in-law Gumley, and instated Luke
Robinson, the old sufferer for my father, and the colleague of
Mr. Chute's brother; an incident that will not heighten your
indifference, any more than it did mine.

Lord Kildare is married to the charming Lady Emily Lennox, who
went the very next day to see her sister Lady Caroline Fox, to
the great mortification of the haughty Duchess-mother.  They
have not given her a shilling, but the King endows her, by
making Lord Kildare a Viscount Sterling:(1340) and they talk
of giving him a Pinchbeck-dukedom too, to keep him always
first peer of Ireland.(1341)  Sir Everard Falkener is married
to Miss Churchill, and my sister is brought to bed of a son.

Panciatici is arrived, extremely darkened in his person and
enlivened in his manner.  He was much in fashion at the Hague,
but I don't know if he will succeed so well here: for in such
great cities as this, you know people affect not to think
themselves honoured by foreigners; and though we don't quite
barbarize them as the French do, they are toujours des
etrangers.  Mr. Chute thinks we have to the full all the
politeness that can make a nation brutes to the rest of the
world.  He had an excellent adventure the other day with Lord
Holderness, whom he met at a party it Lady Betty Germains; but
who could not possibly fatigue himself to recollect that they
had ever met before in their lives.  Towards the end of dinner
Lady Betty mentioned remembering a grandmother of Mr. Chute
who was a peeress: immediately the Earl grew as fond of him as
if they had walked together at a coronation.  He told me
another good story last night of Lord Hervey,(1342) who was
going with them from the Opera, and was so familiar as to beg
they would not call him my Lord and your Lordship.  The
freedom proceeded; when on a sudden, he turned to Mr. Whithed,
and with a distressed friendly voice, said, "Now have you no
peerage that can come to you by any woman?"

Adieu! my dear Sir; I have no news to tell you.  Here is
another letter of Niccolini that has lain in my standish this
fortnight.

(1336) All the succeeding paragraph alludes to Princess Craon.

(1337) Her gentleman usher.

(1338) The Electress Palatine Dowager, the last of the house
of Medici; she lived at Florence.

(1339) The drama of Fetonte was written by Vaneschi.  "The
best apologies for the absurdities of an Italian opera, in a
country where the language is little understood, are," says
Dr. Burney, "good music and exquisite singing: unluckily,
neither the composition nor performance of Phaeton had the
siren power of enchanting men so much, as to stimulate
attention at the expense of reason." Hist. of Music, Vol. iv.

Leinster, of Taplow, in Bucks, Feb. 21st, 1747.-D.

Lennox the Duke had seventeen children.-E.

521 Letter  230
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 20, 1747.

I have been living at old Lovat's trial, and was willing to
have it over before I talked to you of it.  It lasted seven
days: the evidence was as strong as possible; and after all he
had denounced, he made no defence.  The
Solicitor-General,(1343) who was one of the managers for the
House of Commons, shone extremely; the Attorney-General
,(1344) who is a much greater lawyer, is cold and tedious.
The old creature's behaviour has been foolish, and at last,
indecent.  I see little of parts in him, nor attribute much to
that cunning for which he is so famous: it might catch wild
Highlanders; but the art of dissimulation and flattery is so
refined and improved, that it is of little use where it is not
very delicate.  His character seems a mixture of tyranny and
pride in his villainy.  I must make you a little acquainted
with him.  In his own domain he governed despotically, either
burning or plundering the lands and houses of his open
enemies, or taking off his secret ones by the assistance of
his cook, who was his poisoner in chief.  He had two servants
who married without his consent; he said, "You shall have
enough of each other," and stowed them in a dungeon, that had
been a well for three weeks.  When he came to the Tower, he
told them, that if he were not so old and infirm, they would
find it difficult to keep him there.  They told him they had
kept much younger: "Yes," said he, "but they were
inexperienced: they had not broke so many gaols as I have." At
his own house he used to say, that for thirty years of his
life he never saw a gallows but it made his neck ache.  His
last act was to shift his treason upon his eldest son, whom he
forced into the rebellion.  He told Williamson, the Lieutenant
of the Tower, "We will hang my eldest son, and then my second
shall marry your niece." He has a sort of ready humour at
repartee, not very well adapted to his situation.  One day
that Williamson complained that he could not sleep, he was so
haunted with rats, he replied, "What do you say, that you are
so haunted with Reitc yeq?" The first day, as he was brought
to his trial, a woman looked into the coach, and said, "You
ugly old dog, don't you think that you will have that
frightful head cut off?" He replied, You ugly old -, I believe
I shall." At his trial he affected great weakness and
infirmities, but often broke into passions; particularly at
the first witness, who was his vassal: he asked him how he
dared to come thither! The man replied, to satisfy his
conscience.  Murray, the Pretender's secretary, was the chief
evidence, who, in the course of his information, mentioned
Lord Traquair's having conversed with Lord Barrymore, Sir
Watkin Williams, and Sir John Cotton, on the Pretender's
affairs, but that they were shy.  He was proceeding to name
others, but was stopped by Lord Talbot, and the court
acquiesced--I think very indecently.  It is imagined the
Duchess of Norfolk would have come next upon the stage.  The
two Knights were present, as was Macleod, against whom a
bitter letter from Lovat was read, accusing him of breach of
faith; and afterwards Lovat summoned him to answer some
questions he had to ask; but did not.  it is much expected
that Lord Traquair, who is a great coward, will give ample
information of the whole plot.  When Sir Everard Falkener had
been examined(1345) against Lovat, the Lord High Steward asked
the latter if he had any thing to say to Sir Everard? he
replied, "No; but that he was his humble servant, and wished
him joy of his young wife."  The two last days he behaved
ridiculously, joking, and making every body laugh even at the
sentence.  He said to Lord Ilchester, who sat near the bar,
"Je meUrs pour ma patrie, et ne m'en soucie gueres."  When he
withdrew, he said, "Adieu! my lords, we shall never meet again
in the same place."(1346)  He says he will be hanged; for that
his neck is so short and bended, that he should be struck in
the shoulders.  I did not think it possible to feel so little
as I did at so melancholy a spectacle, but tyranny and
villainy wound up by buffoonery took off all edge of concern-.
The foreigners were much struck; Niccolini seemed a great deal
shocked, but he comforts himself with the knowledge he thinks
he has gained of the English constitution.

Don't thank Riccardi for me: I don't feel obliged for his
immoderate demand, but expect very soon to return him his
goods; for I have no notion that the two Lords, who are to see
them next week, will rise near his price.  We have nothing
like news: all the world has been entirely taken up with the
trial. -Here is a letter from Mr. Whithed to Lord Hobart.  Mr.
Chute would have written to-Day, if I had not; but will next
post.  Adieu!

(1343) William Murray.

(1344) Sir Dudley Ryder; afterwards Lord Chief Justice.

(1345) He was secretary to the Duke, whom he had attended into
Scotland during the rebellion.

(1346) Lord Byron has put nearly the same words into the mouth
of Israel Bertuccio, in his tragedy of Marino Falicro.-E.



522 Letter 131
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 10, 1747.

I deferred writing to you as long as they deferred the
execution of old Lovat, because I had a mind to send you some
account of his death, as I had of his trial.  He was beheaded
yesterday, and died extremely well, without passion,
affectation, buffoonery, or timidity: his behaviour was
natural and intrepid.  He professed himself a Jansenist; made
no speech, but sat down a little while in a chair on the
scaffold, and talked to the people round him.  He said, "he
was glad to suffer for his country, dulce est pro patria mori;
that he did not know how, but he had always loved it, nescio
qua natale solum, etc.; that he had never swerved from his
principles; that this was the character of his family, who had
been gentlemen for five hundred years."  He lay down quietly,
gave the sign soon, and was despatched at a blow. I believe it
will strike some terror into the Highlands, when they hear
there is any power great enough to bring so potent a tyrant to
the block.  A scaffold fell down, and killed several persons;
one, a man that had rid post from Salisbury the day before to
see the ceremony; and a woman was taken up dead with a live
child in her arms.  The body(1347) is sent into Scotland: the
day was cold, and before It set out, the coachman drove the
hearse about the court, before my Lord Traquair's dungeon,
which could be no agreeable sight: it might to Lord Cromartie,
who is above the chair.(1348)  Mr. Chute was at the execution
with the Italians, who were more entertained than shocked:
Panciatici told me, "It was a triste spectacle, mais qu'il ne
laissoit d'`etre beau."  Niccolini has treasured it up among
his insights into the English constitution.  We have some
chance of a Peer's trial that has nothing to do with the
rebellion.  A servant of a college has been killed at Oxford,
and a verdict of wilful murder by persons unknown, brought in
by the coroner's inquest.  These persons unknown are supposed
to be Lord Abergavenny,(1349) Lord Charles Scot,(1350) and two
more, who had played tricks with the poor fellow that night,
while he was drunk, and the next morning he was found with his
skull fractured, at the foot of the first Lord's staircase.
One pities the poor boys, who undoubtedly did not foresee the
melancholy event of their sport.

I shall not be able till the next letter to tell you about
Riccardi's gems: Lord Duncannon has been in the country; but
he and Lord Carlisle are to come to me next Sunday, and
determine.

Mr. Chute gave you some account of the Independents:(1351) the
committee have made a foolish affair of it, and cannot furnish
a report.  Had it extended to three years ago, Lord Sandwich
and Grenville(1352) of the admiralty would have made an
admirable figure as dictators of some of the most Jacobite
healths that ever were invented.  Lord Doneraile, who is made
comptroller to the Prince, went to the committee, (whither all
members have a right to go, though not to vote, as it is
select, not secret,) and plagued Lyttelton to death, with
pressing him to inquire into the healths of the year '43.  The
ministry are now trembling at home, with fear of losing the
Scotch bills for humbling the Highland chiefs: they have
whittled them down almost to nothing, in complaisance to the
Duke of Argyll: and at last he deserts them.  Abroad they are
in panics for Holland, where the French have at once besieged
two towns, that must fall into their hands, though we have
plumed ourselves so much on the Duke's being at the head of a
hundred and fifteen thousand men.

There has been an excellent civil war in the house of Finch:
our friend, Lady Charlotte,(1353( presented a daughter of John
Finch, (him who was stabbed by Sally Salisbury,(1354)) his
offspring by Mrs. Younger,(1355) whom he since married.  The
King, Prince, and Princess received her: her aunt, Lady
Bel,(1356) forbad Lady Charlotte to present her to Princess
Emily, whether, however, she carried her in defiance.  Lady
Bel called it publishing a bastard at court, and would not
present her--think on the poor girl!  Lady Charlotte, with
spirit, presented her herself.  Mr. W. Finch stepped up to his
other sister, the Marchioness of Rockingham,(1357) and
whispered her with his composed civility, that he knew it was
a plot of her and Lady Bel to make Lady Charlotte miscarry.
The sable dame (who, it is said, is the blackest of the
family, because she swept the chimney) replied, "This is not a
place to be indecent, and therefore I shall only tell you that
you are a rascal and a villain, and that if ever you dare to
put your head into my house, I will kick you down stairs
myself."  Politesse Anglaise!  lord Winchilsea (who, with his
brother Edward, is embroiled with both sides) came in, and
informed every body of any circumstances that tended to make
both parties in the wrong.  I am impatient to hear how this
operates between my Lady Pomfret and her friend, Lady Bel.
Don't you remember how the Countess used to lug a half-length
picture of the latter behind her post-chaise all over Italy,
and have a new frame made for it in every town where she
stopped? and have you forgot their correspondence, that poor
lady Charlotte was daily and hourly employed to transcribe
into a great book, with the proper names in red ink?  I have
but just room to tell you that the King is perfectly well, and
that the Pretender's son was sent from Spain as soon as he
arrived there.  Thank you for the news of Mr. Townshend.
Adieu!

525 Letter 232
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Arlington Street, April 16, 1747.

Dear Harry,
We are all skyrockets and bonfires tonight for your last
year's victory;(1359) but if you have a mind to perpetuate
yourselves in the calendar, you must take care to refresh your
conquests.  I was yesterday out of town, and the very signs as
I passed through the villages made me make very quaint
reflections on the mortality of fame and popularity.  I
observed how the Duke's head had succeeded almost universally
to Admiral Vernon's, as his had left but few traces of the
Duke of Ormond's.  I pondered these things in my heart, and
said unto myself, Surely all glory is but as a sign!

You have heard that old lovat's tragedy is over: it has been
succeeded by a little farce, containing the humours of the
Duke of Newcastle and his man Stone.  The first event was a
squabble between his grace and the Sheriff about holding up
the head on the scaffold--a custom that has been disused, and
which the Sheriff would not comply with, as he received no
order in writing.  Since that, the Duke has burst ten yards of
breeches strings(1360) about the body, which was to be sent
into Scotland; but it seems it is customary for vast numbers
to rise to attend the most trivial burial.  The Duke, who is
always at least as much frightened at doing right as at doing
wrong, was three days before he got courage enough to order
the burying in the Tower.  I must tell you an excessive good
story of George Selwyn -. Some women were scolding him for
going to see the execution, and asked him, how he could be
such a barbarian to see the head cut off?  "Nay," says he, "if
that was such a crime, I am sure I have made amends, for I
went to see it sewed on again." When he was at the
undertaker's, as soon as they had stitched him together, and
were going to put the body into the coffin, George, in my Lord
Chancellor's voice, said "My Lord lovat, your lordship may
rise."  My Lady Townshend has picked up a little stable-boy in
the Tower, which the warders have put upon her for a natural
son of Lord Kilmarnock's, and taken him into her own house.
You need not tell Mr. T. this from me.

We have had a great and fine day in the House on the second
reading the bill for taking away the heritable Jurisdictions
in Scotland.  Lyttelton made the finest oration imaginable;
the Solicitor General, the new Advocate,(1361) and Hume
Campbell, particularly the last. spoke excessively well for
it, and Oswald against it.  The majority was 233 against 102.
Pitt was not there; the Duchess of Queensberry had ordered him
to have the gout.

I will give you a commission once more, to tell Lord
Bury(1362) that he has quite dropped me: if I thought he would
take me up again, I would write to him; a message would
encourage me.  Adieu!

526 Letter 233
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 5, 1747.

It is impossible for me to tell you more of the new
Stadtholder(1363) than you must have heard from all quarters.
Hitherto his existence has been of no service to his country.
Hulst, which we had heard was relieved, has surrendered.  The
Duke was in it privately, just before it was taken, with only
two aide-de-camps, and has found means to withdraw our three
regiments.  We begin to own now that the French are superior:
I never believed they were not, or that we had taken the field
before them; for the moment we had taken it, we heard of
Marshal Saxe having detached fifteen thousand men to form
sieges.  There is a print published in Holland of the Devil
weighing the Count de Saxe and Count lowendahl in a pair of
scales, with this inscription:

Tous deux vaillants,
Tous deux galants,
Tous deux constants,

Tous deux galiards,
Tous deux paliards,
Tous deux b`atards,(1364)

Tous deux sans foi.
Tous deux sans loi.
Tous deux `a moi.

We are taken up with the Scotch bills for weakening clanships
and taking away heritable Jurisdictions.  I have left them
sitting on it to-day, but was pleased with a period of Nugent.
"These jurisdictions are grievous, but nobody complains of
them; therefore, what? therefore, they are excessively
grievous." We had a good-natured bill moved to-day by Sir
William Yonge, to allow council to prisoners on impeachments
for treason, as they have on indictments.  It hurt every body
at old Lovat's trial, all guilty as he was, to see an old
wretch worried by the first lawyers in England, without any
assistance but his own unpractised defence.  It had not the
least opposition; yet this was a point struggled for in King
William's reign, as a privilege and dignity inherent in the
Commons, that the accused by them should have no assistance of
council.  how reasonable, that men, chosen by their
fellow-subjects for the defence of their fellow-subjects,
should have rights detrimental to the good of the people whom
they are to protect! Thank God! we are a better-natured age,
and have relinquished this savage privilege with a good grace!

Lord Cowper(1365) has resigned the bedchamber, on the
Beef-eaters being given to Lord Falmouth.  The latter, who is
powerful in elections, insisted on having it: the other had
nothing but a promise from the King, which the ministry had
already twice forced him to break.

Mr. Fox gave a great ball last week at Holland House. which he
has taken for a long term, and where he is making great
improvements.  It is a brave old house, and belonged to the
gallant Earl of Holland, the lover of Charles the First's
Queen.  His motto has puzzled every body; it is Ditior est qui
se.  I was allowed to hit off an interpretation, which yet one
can hardly reconcile to his gallantry, nor can I decently
repeat it to you.  While I am writing, the Prince is going
over the way to Lord Middlesex's, where there is a ball in
mask to-night for the royal children.

The two Lords have seen and refused Marquis Riccardi's gems: I
shall deliver them to Pucci; but am so simple (you will laugh
at me) as to keep the four I liked: that is, I will submit to
give him fifty pounds for them, if he will let me choose one
ring more; for I will at least have it to call them at ten
guineas apiece.  If he consents, I will remit the money to
you, or pay it to Pucei, as he likes.  If not, I return them
with the rest of the car,,o.  I can choose no ring for which I
would give five guineas.

I have received yours of April 25th, since I came home.  You
will scold me for being so careless about the Pretender's son;
but I am determined not to take up his idea again, till he is
at least on this side Derby.  Do excuse me; but when he could
not get to London, with all the advantages which the ministry
had smoothed for him, how can he ever meet more concurring
circumstances?  If my lady'S(1366) return has no better
foundation than Niccolini's authority, I assure you you may
believe as little of it as you please.  If he knows no more of
her, than he does of every thing else that he pretends to
know, as I am persuaded he does not, knowledge cannot possibly
be thinner spread.  He has been a progress to add more matter
to the mass, that he already don't understand.  Adieu!

(1363) The Prince of Orange had just been raised to that

527 Letter 234
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 19th, 1747,

As you will receive the Gazette at the same time with this
letter, I shall leave you to that for the particulars of the
great naval victory that Anson has gained over the French off
Cape Finisterre.(1367)  It is a very big event, and by far one
of the most considerable that has happened during this war.
By it he has defeated two expeditions at once; for the fleet
he has demolished was to have split, part for the recovery of
Cape Breton, part for the East Indies.  He has always been
most remarkably fortunate: Captain Granville, the youngest of
the brothers, was as unlucky: he was killed by the cannon that
was fired as a signal for their striking.(1368)  He is
extremely commended: I am not partial to the family; but it is
but justice to mention, that when he took a great prize some
time ago, after a thousand actions of generosity to his
officers and crew, he cleared sixteen thousand pounds, of
which he gave his sister ten.  The King is in great spirits.
The French fought exceedingly well.

I have no other event to tell you, but the promotion of a new
brother of yours.  I condole with you, for they have literally
sent one Dayrolies(1369) resident to Holland, under Lord
Sandwich,

--Minum partes tractare secundas.

This curious minister has always been a led-captain to the
Dukes of Grafton and Richmond; used to be sent to auctions for
them, and to walk in the Park with their daughters, and once
went dry nurse to Holland with them.  He has belonged, too, a
good deal to my Lord Chesterfield, to whom, I believe, he owes
this new honour; as he had before made him black-rod in
Ireland, and gave the ingenious reason, that he had a black
face.  I believe he has made him a minister, as one year, at
Tunbridge, he had a mind to make a wit of Jacky Barnard, and
had the impertinent vanity to imagine that his authority was
sufficient.

Your brother has gone over the way with Mr. Whithed, to choose
some of Lord Cholmondeley's pictures for his debt; they are
all given up to the creditors, who yet scarce receive forty
per cent. of their money.

It is wrong to send so short a letter as this so far, I know;
but what can one do? After the first fine shower, I will send
you a much longer.  Adieu!

war and four of their East Indiamen, and sunk or destroyed the
rest of their fleet.-D.

a column to his memory in the gardens at Stowe.]

528 Letter 235
To Sir Horace Mann
Arlington Street, June 5, 1747.

Don't be more frightened at hearing the Parliament is to be
dissolved in a fortnight, than you are obliged to be as a good
minister.  Since this Parliament has not brought over the
Pretender, I trust the death of it will not.  You will want to
know the reason of this sudden step: several are given, as the
impossibility of making either peace or war, till they are
secure of a new majority; but I believe the true motive is to
disappoint the Prince, who was not ready with his elections.
In general, people seem to like the measure, except the
Speaker, who is very pompous about it, and speaks
constitutional paragraphs.  There are rumours of changes to
attend its exit.  People imagine Lord Chesterfield(1370) is to
quit, but I know no other grounds for this belief, than that
they conclude the Duke of Newcastle must be jealous of him by
this time. Lord Sandwich is looked upon as his successor,
Whenever it shall happen.  He is now here, to look after his
Huntingdonshire boroughs.  We talk nothing but
elections-however, it is better than talking them for a year
together.  Mine for Callington (for I would not come in for
Lynn, which I have left to Prince Pigwiggin(1371)) is so easy,
that I shall have no trouble, not even the dignity of being
carried in triumph, like the lost sheep, on a porter's
shoulders but may retire to a little new farm that I have
taken just out of Twickenham.  The house is so small, that I
can send it you in a letter to look at: the prospect is as
delightful as possible, commanding the river, the town, and
Richmond Park; and being situated on a hill descends to the
Thames through two or three little meadows, where I have some
Turkish sheep and two cows, all studied in their colours for
becoming the view.  This little rural bijou was Mrs.
Chenevix's, the toy-woman `a la mode, who in every dry season
is to furnish me with the best rain-water from Paris, and now
and then with some Dresden-china cows, who are to figure like
wooden classics in a library: so I shall grow as much a
shepherd as any swain in the Astrea.

Admiral Anson(1372) is made a baron, and Admiral Warren(1373)
Knight of the Bath-so is Niccolini to be-when the King
dies.(1374)  His Majesty and his son were last night at the
masquerade at Ranelagh, where there was so little company,
that I was afraid they would be forced to walk about together.

I have been desired to write to you for two scagliola tables;
will you get them? I will thank you, an pay you too.

You will hardly believe that I intend to send you this for a
letter, but I do.  Mr. Chute said he would write to you
to-day, so mine goes as page to his.  Adieu!

(1370) He was now secretary of state, which office he did not
resign till Feb. 1748.-D.

(1371) Eldest son of Horatio, brother of Sir Robert Walpole.

(1372) George Anson, created Lord Anson of Soberton.  He is
well known for his voyages round the world, as well as for his
naval successes.  He was long first lord of the admiralty; but
did not distinguish himself as a statesman.  He died suddenly,
while walking in his garden at Moor Park in Hertfordshire,
June 6th, 1762.-D.

530 Letter 236
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Twickenham, June 8, 1747.

You perceive by my date that I am got into a new camp, and
have left my tub at Windsor.  It is a little plaything-house
that I got out of Mrs. Chenevix's shop, and is the prettiest
bauble you ever saw.  It is set in enamelled meadows, with
filigree hedges:

"A small Euphrates through the piece is roll'd,
And little finches wave their wings in gold"

Two delightful roads, that you would call dusty, supply me
continually with coaches and chaises; barges as solemn as
barons of the exchequer move under my window; Richmond Hill
and Ham Walks bound my prospect; but, thank God! the Thames is
between me and the Duchess of Queensberry.  Dowagers (-As
plenty as flounders inhabit all around, and Pope's ghost is
just now skimming under my window by a most poetical
moonlight. I have about land enough to keep such a farm as
Noah's, when he set up in the ark with a pair of each kind;
but my cottage is rather cleaner than I believe his was after
they had been cooped up together forty days.  The Chenevixes
had tricked it out for themselves: up two pair of stairs is
what they call Mr. Chenevix's library, furnished with three
maps, one shelf, a bust of Sir Isaac Newton, and a lame
telescope without any glasses.  Lord John Sackville
predeceased me here, and instituted certain games called
cricketalia, which have been celebrated this very evening in
honour of him in a neighbouring meadow.

You will think I have removed my philosophy from Windsor with
my tea-things hither; for I am writing to you in all this
tranquillity, while a Parliament is bursting about my ears.
You know it is going to be dissolved: I am told, you are taken
care of, though I don't know where, nor whether any body that
chooses you will quarrel with me because he does choose you,
as that little bug the Marquis of Rockingham did; one of the
calamities of my life which I have bore as abominably well as
I do most about which I don't care.  They say the Prince has
taken up two hundred thousand pounds, to carry elections which
he won't carry:--he had much better have saved it to buy the
Parliament after it is chosen.  A new set of peers are in
embryo, to add more dignity to the silence of the House of
Lords.

I make no remarks on your campaign,(1375) because, as you say,
you do nothing at all; which, though very proper nutriment for
a thinking head, does not do quite so well to write upon.  If
any one of you can but contrive to be shot upon your post, it
is all we desire, shall look upon it as a great curiosity, and
will take care to set up a monument to the person so slain; as
we are doing by vote to Captain Cornwall, who was killed at
the beginning Of the action in the Mediterranean four years
ago.(1376)  In the present dearth of glory, he is canonized;
though, poor man! he had been tried twice the year before for
cowardice.(1377)

I could tell you much election news, none else; though not
being thoroughly attentive to so important a subject, as to be
sure one ought to be, I might now and then mistake, and give
you a candidate for Durham in place of one for Southampton, or
name the returning-officer instead of the candidate.  In
general, I believe, it is much as usual-those sold in detail
that afterwards will be sold in the representation--the
ministers bribing Jacobites to choose friends of their own-
-the name of well-wishers to the present establishment, and
patriots outbidding ministers that they may make the better
market of their own patriotism:-in short, all England, under
some flame or other, is just now to be bought and sold;
though, whenever we become posterity and forefathers, we shall
be in high repute for wisdom and virtue.  My
great-great-grandchildren will figure me with a white beard
down to my girdle; and Mr. Pitt's will believe him unspotted
enough to have walked over nine hundred hot ploughshares,
without hurting the sole of his foot.  How merry my ghost will
be, and shake its ears to hear itself quoted as a person of
consummate prudence! Adieu, dear Harry! Yours ever.

(1375) Mr Conway was in Flanders with the Duke of Cumberland.

(1376) The House of Commons, on the 28th of May, had agreed to
erect a monument in Westminster Abbey to the memory of Captain
Cornwall, of the Marlborough; who was slain while bravely
defending his ship.  The monument, designed and executed bye
Taylor, was completed in 1755. --E.

(1377) And honourably acquitted on both occasions.-E.



531 Letter 237
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 26, 1747.

You can have no idea of the emptiness of London, and of the
tumult every where else.  To-day many elections begin.  The
sums of money disbursed within this month would give any body
a very faint idea of the poverty of this undone country!  I
think the expense and contest is greater now we are said to be
all of a mind, than when parties ran highest.  Indeed, I
ascribe part of the solitude in town to privilege being at an
end; though many of us can afford to bribe so high, it is not
so easy to pay debts.  Here am I, as Lord Cornbury(1378) says,
sitting for a borough, while every body else stands for one.
He diverted me extremely the other day with the application of
a story to the King's speech.  It says, the reason for
dissolving the Parliament is its being so near
dissolution:(1379) Lord Cornbury said it put him in mind of a
gaoler in Oxfordshire who was remarkably humane to his
prisoners; one day he said to one of them, "My good friend,
you know you are to be hanged on Friday se'nnight; I want
extremely to go to London; would you be so kind as to be
hanged next Friday?"

Pigwiggin is come over, more Pigwiggin than ever!  He
entertained me with the horrid ugly figures that he saw at the
Prince of Orange's court; think of his saying ugly figures!
He is to be chosen for Lynn,-whither I would not go, because I
must have gone; I go to Callington again, whither I don't go.
My brother chooses Lord luxborough(1380) for Castlerising.
Would you know the connexion?  This Lord keeps Mrs. Horton the
player; we keep Miss Norsa the player: Rich the harlequin is
an intimate of all; and to cement the harlequinity, somebody's
brother (excuse me if I am not perfect in such genealogy) is
to marry the Jewess's sister.  This coup de th`eatre procured
Knight his Irish coronet, and has now stuffed him into
Castlerising, about which my brother has quarrelled with me,
for not looking upon it, as, what he called, a family-borough.
Excuse this ridiculous detail; it serves to introduce the
account of the new peers, for Sir Jacob Bouverie, a
considerable Jacobite, who is made Viscount Folkestone, bought
his ermine at twelve thousand pound a-yard of the Duchess of
Kendal(1381) d'aujourd'hui.  Sir Harry Liddel is Baron
Ravensworth, and Duncombe Baron Feversham; Archer and Rolle
have only changed their Mr.ships for Lordships.  Lord
Middlesex has lost one of his Lordships, that of the Treasury;
is succeeded by the second Grenville, and he by Ellis,(1382)
at the admiralty.  Lord Ashburnham had made a magnificent
summer suit to wait, but Lord Cowper at last does not resign
the bedchamber.  I intend to laugh over this disgrazia with
the Chuteheds, when they return triumphant from Hampshire,
where Whitehed has no enemy.  A-propos to enemies! I believe
the battle in Flanders is compromised, for one never hears of
it.

The Duchess of Queensberry(1383) has at last been at court, a
point she has been intriguing these two years.  Nobody gave in
to it.  At last she snatched at the opportunity of her son
being obliged to the King for a regiment in the Dutch service,
and would not let him go to thank, till they sent for her too.
Niccolini, who is next to her in absurdity and importance, is
gone electioneering with Doddington.

I expect Pucci every day to finish my trouble with Riccardi; I
shall take any ring, though he has taken care I shall not take
another tolerable one.  If you will pay him, which I fancy
will be the shortest way to prevent any fripponnerie, I will
put the money into your brother's hands.


My eagle(1384) is arrived-my eagle tout court, for I hear
nothing of the pedestal: the bird itself was sent home in a
store-ship; I was happy that they did not reserve the statue,
and send its footstool.  It is a glorious fowl! I admire it,
and every body admires it as much as it deserves.  There never
was so much spirit and fire preserved, with so much labour and
finishing.  It stands fronting the Vespasian: there are no two
such morsels in England!

Have you a mind for an example of English bizarrerie?  there
is a Fleming here, who carves exquisitely in ivory, one
Verskovis; he has done much for me, and where I have
recommended him; but he is starving, and returning to Rome, to
carve for-the English, for whom, when he was there before, he
could not work fast enough.(1385)

I know nothing, nor ever heard of the Mills's and Davisons;
and know less than nothing Of whether they are employed from
hence.  There is nobody in town of whom to inquire; if there
were, they would ask me for what borough these men were to
stand, and wonder that I could name people from any other
motive.  Adieu!

533 Letter 238
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, July 2, 1747.

Dear George,
Though we have no great reason to triumph, as we have
certainly been defeated,(1386) yet the French have as
certainly bought their victory dear: indeed, what would be
very dear to us, is not so much to them.  However, their least
loss is twelve thousand men; as our least loss is five
thousand.  The truth of the whole is, that the Duke was
determined to fight at all events, which the French, who
determined not to fight but at great odds, took advantage of.
His Royal Highness's valour has shone extremely, but at the
expense of his judgment.  Harry Conway, whom nature always
designed for a hero of romance, and who is d`eplac`e in
ordinary life, did wonders; but was overpowered and flung
down, when one French hussar held him by the hair, while
another was going to stab him: at that instant, an English
sergeant with a soldier came up, and killed the latter; but
was instantly killed himself; the soldier attacked the other,
and Mr. Conway escaped; but was afterwards taken prisoner; is
since released on parole, and may come home to console his
fair widow,,(1387) whose brother, Harry Campbell, is certainly
killed, to the great concern of all widows who want
consolation.  The French have lost the Prince of Monaco, the
Comte de Bavi`ere, natural brother to the last Emperor, and
many officers of great rank.  The French King saw the whole
through a spying-glass, from Hampstead Hill, environed with
twenty thousand men.' Our Guards did shamefully, and many
officers.  The King had a line from Huske in Zealand on the
Friday night, to tell him we were defeated; of his son not a
word - judge of his anxiety till three o'clock on Saturday!
Lord Sandwich had a letter in his pocket all the while, and
kept it there, which said the Duke was well.


We flourish at sea, have taken great part of the Domingo
fleet, and I suppose shall have more lords.  The Countess
touched twelve thousand for Sir Jacob Bouverie's coronet.

I know nothing of my own election, but suppose it is over; as
little of Rigby's, and conclude it lost.  For franks, I
suppose they don't begin till the whole is complete.  My
compliments to your brothers and sisters.

534 Letter 239
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 3, 1747.

You would think it strange not to hear from me after a battle
though the printed relation is so particular, that I could
only repeat what that contains.  The sum total is, that we
would fight. which the French did not intend; we gave them, or
did not take, the advantage of situation; they attacked: what
part of our army was engaged did wonders, for the Dutch ran
away, and we had contrived to post the Austrians in such a
manner, that they could not assist us:(1388) we were
overpowered by numbers, though the centre was first broke by
the retreating Dutch; and though we retired, we killed twelve
thousand of the enemy, and lost six ourselves.  The Duke was
very near taken, having through his short sight, mistaken a
body of French for his own people. He behaved as bravely as
usual; but his prowess is so well established, that it grows
time for him to exert other qualities of a general.

We shine at sea; two-and-forty sail of the Domingo fleet have
fallen into our hands, and we expect more.  The ministry are
as successful in their elections: both Westminster and
Middlesex have elected court candidates, and the city of
London is taking the same step, the first time of many years
that the two latter have been Whig; but the non-subscribing at
the time of the rebellion, has been most successfully played
off upon the Jacobites; of which stamp great part of England
was till-the Pretender came.  This would seem a paradox in any
other country, but contradictions are here the only rule of
action.  Adieu!

(1389) The Duke of Cumberland, in a letter to Lord
Chesterfield of the 3d of July, says, "The great misfortune of
our position was that our right wing was so strongly posted,
that they could neither be attacked nor make a diversion; for
I am assured that Marshal Bathiani would have done all in his
power to sustain me, or attack the enemy."-E.



535 Letter 240
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 28, 1747.

This is merely one of my letters of course, for I have nothing
to tell you.  You will hear that Bergen-op-zoom still holds
out, and is the first place that has not said yes, the moment
the French asked it the question.  The Prince of Waldeck has
resigned, on some private disgust with the Duke.  Mr. Chute
received a letter from you yesterday, with the account of the
deliverance of Genoa, which had reached us before, and had
surprised nobody.  But when you wrote, you did not know of the
great victory obtained by eleven battalions of PiedmOntese
over six-and-forty of the French, and of the lucky but brave
death of their commander, the Chevalier de Belleisle.  He is a
great loss to the French, none to Count Saxe; an irreparable
one to his own brother. whom, by the force of his parts, he
had pushed so high, at the same time always declining to raise
himself, lest he should eclipse the Marshal, who seems now to
have missed the ministry by his Italian scheme, as he did
before by his ill success in Germany.  We talk of nothing but
peace: I hope we shall not make as bad an one as we have made
a war, though one is the natural consequence of the other.

We have at last discovered the pedestal for my glorious eagle,
at the bottom of the store-ship; but I shall not have it out
of the Custom-house till the end of this week.  The lower part
of the eagle's beak(1390) has been broke off and lost.  I wish
you would have the head only of your Gesse cast, and send it
me, to have the original restored from it.

The commission for the scagliola tables was given me without
any dimensions; I suppose there is a common size.  If the
original friar(1391) can make them, I shall be glad: if not, I
fancy the person would not care to wait so long as you
mention, for what would be less handsome than mine.

I am almost ashamed to send you this summer letter; but nobody
is in town; even election news are all over.  Adieu!'

(1390) "Quench'd in dark clouds of slumber lie
The terror of his beak, and lightnings of his eye," Gray.-E.

536 Letter 241
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Sept. 1, 1747.

Your two last are of August 1st and 22d.  I fear my last to
you was of July 28th.  I have no excuse, but having nothing to
tell you, and having been in the country.  Bergen-op-zoom
still holds out; the French having lost great numbers before
it, though at first, at least, it was not at all
well-defended.  Nothing else is talked of, and opinions differ
so much about the event, that I don't pretend to guess what it
will be.  It appears now that if the Dutch had made but decent
defences of all the other towns, France would have made but
slow progress in the conquest of Flanders, and Wanted many
thousand men that now threaten Europe.

There are not ten people in London besides the Chuteheds and
me; the White one is going into Hampshire; I hope to have the
other a little with me at Twickenham, whither I go to-morrow
for the rest of the season.

I don't know what to say to you about Mr. Mill; I can learn
nothing about him: my connexions with any thing ministerial
are little as possible; and were they bigger, the very
commission, that you apprehend, would be a reason to' make
them keep it secret from you, on whose account alone, they
would know I inquired.  I cannot bring myself to believe that
he is employed from hence; and I am always so cautious of
meddling about you, for fear of risking you in any light, that
I am the unfittest person in the world to give you any
satisfaction on this head: however, I shall continue to try.

I never heard any thing so unreasonable as the Pope's request
to that Cardinal Guadagni;(1392) but I suppose they will make
him comply.

You will, I think, like Sir James Grey; he is very civil and
good-humoured, and sensible.  Lord _(1393) is the two former;
but, alas he is returned little wiser than he went.

Is there a bill of exchange sent to your brother? or may not I
pay him without?  it is fifty pounds and three zechins, is it
not?  Thank you.

Pandolfini is gone with Count Harrache; Panciatici goes next
week: I believe he intended staying longer; but either the
finances fail, or he does not know how to dispose of these two
empty months alone; for Niccolini is gone with the Prince to
Cliefden.  I have a notion the latter would never leave
England, if he could but bring himself to change his religion;
or, which he would like as well, if he could persuade the
Prince to change his.  Good night!

Guadagni, to resign a piece of preferment which he was in
possession of.-D.

537 Letter 242
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Oct. 1, 1747.

Dear George,
I wish I could have answered your invitation from the
Tigress's with my own person, but it was impossible.  I wish
your farmer would answer invitations with the persons of more
hens and fewer cocks; for I am raising a breed, and not
recruits.  The time before he sent two to one, and he has done
so again.  I had a letter from Mr. Conway, who is piteously
going into prison again, our great secretary has let the time
Slip for executing the cartel, and the French have reclaimed
their prisoners.  The Duke is coming back.  I fear his candles
are gone to bed to Admiral Vernon's!  He has been ill; they
say his head has been more affected than his body.  Marshal
Saxe sent him Cardinal Polignac's Anti-Lucretius(1393) to send
to Lord Chesterfield.  If he won't let him be a general, at
least 'tis hard to reduce him to a courier.

When I saw you at Kyk in de Pot, I forgot to tell you that
seven more volumes of the Journals are delivering: there's
employment for Moreland.  I go back to Kyk in de Pot tomorrow.
Did you dislike it so much that you could not bring yourself
to persuade your brother to try it with you for a day or two!
I shall be there till the birthday, if you will come.

George Selwyn says, people send to Lord Pembroke to know how
the bridge rested.  You know George never thinks but `a la
t`ete tranch`ee: he came to town t'other day to have a tooth
drawn, and told the man that he would drop his handkerchief
for the signal.  My compliments to your family.

(1393) In 1757, Anti-Lucretius was rendered into English by
Dobson; for whose translation of Paradise Lost into Latin
verse, Auditor Benson, who erected a monument to Milton in
Westminster Abbey, gave him one thousand pounds.  In 1767, a
translation of the first book of the Cardinal's poem was
published by the father of the Right Honourable George
Canning.-E.



537 Letter 243
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Oct. 2, 1747.

I am glad the Chuteheds are as idle as I am for then you will
believe it is nothing but idleness.  I don't know that it is
absolutely so; I rather flatter myself that it is want of
materials that has made me silent, I fear, above these five
weeks.  Literally nothing has happened but the treachery at
Bergen-Op-zoom,(1394) and of that all the world knows at least
as much as I do.  The Duke is coming home, and both armies are
going into quarters, at least for the present: the French, I
suppose, will be in motion again with the first frosts.
Holland seems gone!-How long England will remain after it,
Providence and the French must determine! This is too ample a
subject to write but little upon, and too obvious to require
much.

The Chuteheds have been extremely good, and visited and stayed
with me at Twickenham-I am sorry I must, at your expense, be
happy.  If I were to say all I think of Mr. Chute's immense
honesty, his sense, his wit, his knowledge, and his humanity,
you would think I was writing a dedication.  I am happy in
him: I don't make up to him for you, for he loves nothing a
quarter so well; but I try to make him regret you less-do you
forgive me? Now I am commending your friends, I reproach
myself with never having told you how much I love your brother
Gal.(1395)  you yourself have not more constant
good-humour-indeed he has not such trials with illness as you
have, you patient soul! but he is like you, and much to my
fancy.  Now I live a good deal at Twickenham, I see more of
him, and like to see more of him: you know I don't throw my
liking about the street.

Your Opera must be fine, and that at Naples glorious: they say
we are to have one, but I doubt it.  Lady Middlesex is
breeding-the child will be well-born; the Sackville is the
worst blood it is supposed to swell with.  Lord Holderness has
lost his son.  Lady Charlotte Finch, when she saw company on
her lying-in, had two toilets spread in her bedchamber with
her own and Mr. Finch's dressing plate.  This was certainly a
stroke of vulgarity, that my Lady Pomfret copied from some
festino in Italy.

Lord Bath and his Countess and his son(1396) have been making
a tour: at Lord Leicester's(1397) they forgot to give any
thing to the servants that showed the house; upon
recollection-and deliberation, they sent back a man and horse
six miles with-half a crown! What loads of money they are
saving for the French!

Adieu! my dear child-perhaps you don't know that I , "cast
many a Southern look"(1398) towards Florence-I think within
this half-year I have thought more of making you a visit, than
in any half-year since I left you.  I don't know whether the
difficulties will ever be surmounted, but you cannot imagine
how few they are: I scarce think they are in the plural
number.

(1394) In the letter to Sir Thomas Robinson of the 7th of
November, Sir Everard Fawkener says, "The capture of
Bergen-op-zoom is a subject to make one mad, if any thing had
been done; but the ordinary forms of duty, which never fail in
times of the greatest security, were now, in this critical
time, neglected in the most scandalous manner."  Hence it was
surmised that the place was surrendered through treachery.

539 Letter 244
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 10, 1747.

I came to town but last week; but on looking over the dates of
my letters, I find I am six weeks in arrear to you.  This is a
period that ought to make me blush, and beyond what I think I
was ever guilty - but I have not a tittle to tell you; that
is, nothing little enough has happened, nor big enough, except
Admiral Hawke's(1399) great victory and for that I must have
transcribed the gazettes.

The Parliament met this morning, the House extremely full, and
many new faces.  We have done nothing, but choose a Speaker,
and, in choosing him, flattered Mr. Onslow, who is rechosen.
In about ten days one shall be able to judge of the complexion
of the winter; but there is not likely to be much opposition.
The Duke was Coming, but is gone back to Breda for a few days.
When he does return, it will be only for three weeks.  He is
to watch the French and the negotiations for peace, which are
to be opened-I believe not in earnest.

Whithed has made his entrance into Parliament; I don't expect
he will like it.  The first session is very tiresome with
elections, and without opposition there will be little spirit.

Lady Middlesex has popped out her child before its time; it is
put into spirits, and my Lord very loyally, cries over it.
Lady Gower carried a niece to Leicester-fields(1400) the other
day, to present her; the girl trembled-she pushed her: "What
are you so afraid of? Don't you see that musical clock? Can
you be afraid of a man that has a musical clock?"

Don't call this a letter; I don't call it one; it only comes
to make my letter's excuses.  Adieu!

(1399) Admiral Edward Hawke, afterwards created Lord Hawke,
for his eminent naval services.  On the ]5th July 1747, he met
a large fleet of French merchant-vessels going from the ports
of France to the West Indies. and guarded by a strong force of
ships of war.  He completely routed them, and took six ships
of war. -It was in his despatch to the Admiralty on this
occasion, that he made use of the Following remarkable
expression: "As the enemy's ships were large, they took a
great deal of drubbing."-D.

was Mary Tufton, daughter of Thomas, Earl of Thanet, and widow
of Anthony Gray, Earl of Harold, who became, in 1736, third
wife of John, second Lord Gower.-D.



539 Letter 245
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 24, 1747.

You say so many kind things to me in your letter of Nov. 7th,
on my talking of a journey to Florence, that I am sorry I
mentioned it to you.  I did it to show you that my silence is
far from proceeding from any forgetfulness of you; and as I
really think continually of such a journey, I name it now and
then; though I don't find how to accomplish it.  In short, my
affairs are not so independent of every body, but that they
require my attending to them to make them go smoothly; and
unless I could get them into another situation, it is not
possible for me to leave them. Some part of my fortune is in
my Lord O.'s(1401) hands; and if I were out of the way of
giving him trouble, he has not generosity enough to do any
thing that would be convenient for me.  I will say no more on
this subject, because it is not a pleasant one; nor would I
have said this, but to convince you that I did not mention
returning to Florence out of gaiet`e de coeur.  I never was
happy but there; have a million of times repented returning to
England, where I never was happy, nor expect to be.

For Mr. Chute's silence, next to myself, I can answer for him:
He always loves you, and I am persuaded wishes nothing more
than himself at Florence.  I did hint to him your kind thought
about Venice, because, as I saw no daylight to it, it could
not disappoint him; and because I knew how sensible he would
be to this mark of your friendship.  There is not a glimmering
prospect of our sending a minister to Berlin; if we did, it
would be a person of far greater consideration than Sir James
Grey; and even if he went thither, there are no means of
procuring his succession for Mr. Chute.  My dear child, you
know little of England, if you think such and so quiet merit
as his likely to meet friends here.  Great assurance, or great
quality, are the only recommendations.  My father was abused
for employing low people with parts-that complaint is totally
removed.

You reproach me with telling you nothing of Bergen-op-zoom;
seriously, I know nothing but what was in the papers; and in
general, on those great public events, I must transcribe the
gazette, if you will have me talk to you.  You will have seen
by the King's speech that a congress is appointed at
Aix-la-Chapelle, but nobody expects any effect from it.
Except Mr. Pelham, the ministry in general are for the war;
and, what is comical, the Prince and the Opposition are so
too.  We have had but one division yet in the House, which was
on the Duke of Newcastle's interfering in the Seaford
election.  The numbers were, 247 for the court, against 96.
But I think it very probable that, in a little time, a
stronger opposition will be formed, for the Prince has got
some new and very able speakers; particularly a young Mr.
Potter,(1402) son of the last Archbishop, who promises very
greatly; the world is already matching him against Mr. Pitt.

I sent Niccolini the letter; and here is another from him.  I
have not seen him this winter, nor heard of him: he is of very
little consequence, when there is any thing else that is.


I have lately had Lady Mary Wortley's Eclogues(1403)
published; but they don't please, though so excessively good.
I say so confidently, for Mr. Chute agrees with me: he says,
for the epistle to Arthur Gray,(1404) scarce any woman could
have written it, and no man; for a man who had had experience
enough to paint such sentiments so well, would not have had
warmth enough left.  Do you know any thing of Lady Mary? her
adventurer son(1405) is come into Parliament, but has not
opened.  Adieu! my dear child: nous nous reverrons un jour!

(1401) Lord Orford, the eldest brother of Horace Walpole.-D.


(1402) Thomas, second son of Dr. Potter, Archbishop of
Canterbury, was appointed secretary to the Princess of Wales,
in which post he remained till the death of the Prince: he
made two celebrated speeches on the Seaford election, and on
the contest between Aylesbury and Buckingham for the summer
assizes; but did not long support the character here given of
him. [In 1757, he was made joint vice-treasurer of Ireland,
and died in June 1759.  Several letters, addressed by him to
Mr. Pitt, will be found in the first volume of the Chatham
Correspondence.)

(1403) Some of those Eclogues had been printed long before:
they were now published, with other of her poems, by Dodsley,
in quarto, and soon after, with others, reprinted in his
Miscellany. [They will be found in Lord Wharncliffe's edition
of Lady Mary's Works, vol. iii. p. 350.]

(1404) The epistle was from Arthur Grey, the footman, and
addressed to Mrs. Murray, after his condemnation for
attempting to commit violence.  The man was tried for the
offence in 1721, and transported.  See Works, vol. i. p. 71,
and vol. iii. p. 402, where the epistle is printed.-E.

(1405) Edward Wortley Montagu, after a variety of adventures
in various characters, was taken up -,it Paris with Mr.
Teaffe, another member of Parliament, and imprisoned in Fort
L`eveque, for cheating and robbing a Jew.  (Mr.  Montagu was
confined in the Grand Chatelet from the 31st of October till
the 2nd of November.  For his own account of the affair, see
Nichols's Literary Anecdotes, vol. iv. p. 629.]



541 Letter 246
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 12, 1748.

I have just received a letter from you of the 19th of last
month, in which you tell me you was just going to complain of
me, when you received one from me: I fear I am again as much
to blame, as far as not having written; but if I had, it would
only be to repeat what you say would be sufficient, but what I
flatter myself I need not repeat.  The town has been quite
empty; and the Parliament which met but yesterday, has been
adjourned these three weeks.  Except elections, and such
tiresome squabbles, I don't believe it will produce any thing:
it is all harmony.  From Holland we every day hear bad news,
which, though we don't believe-at the present, we agree it is
always likely to be true by tomorrow.  Yet, with no prospect
of success, and scarce with a possibility of beginning another
campaign, we are as martial as ever: I don't know whether it
is, because we think a bad peace worse than a bad war, or that
we don't look upon misfortunes and defeats abroad as enough
our own, and are willing to taste of both at home.  We are in
no present apprehension from domestic disturbances, nor, in my
private opinion, do I believe the French will attempt us, till
it is for themselves.  They need not be at the trouble of
sending us Stuarts; that ingenious house could not have done
the work of France more effectually than the Pelhams and the
patriots have.

I will tell you a secret: there is a transaction going on to
send Sir Charles Williams to Turin; he has asked it. and it is
pushed.  In my private opinion, I don't believe
Villettes(1406) will be easily overpowered; though I wish it,
from loving Sir Charles and from thinking meanly of the other;
but talents are no passports.  Sir Everard Falkener(1407) is
going to Berlin.  General Sinclair is presently to succeed
Wentworth: he is Scotchissime, in all the latitude of the
word, and not very able; he made a poor business of it at Port
l'Orient.

Lord Coke(1408) has demolished himself very fast: I mean his
character: you know he was married but last spring; he is
always drunk, has lost immense sums at play, and seldom goes
home to his wife till early in the morning.  The world is
vehement on her side; and not only her family, but his own,
give him up.  At present, matters are patching up by the
mediation of my brother, but I think can never go on: she
married him extremely against her will, and he is at least an
out-pensioner of Bedlam: his mother's family have many of them
been mad.

I thank you, I have received the eagle's head: the bill is
broken off individually in the same spot with the original;
but, as the piece is not lost, I believe it will serve.

I should never have expected you to turn Lorrain:(1409) is
your Madame de Givrecourt a successor(1410) of my sister? I
think you hint so.  Where is the Princess, that you are so
reduced?  Adieu! my dear child.  I don't say a kind word to
you, because you seem to think it necessary, for assuring you
of the impossibility of my ever forgetting, or loving you
less.

(1406) Minister at Turin, and afterwards in Switzerland.

(1407) He had been ambassador at Constantinople: he was not
sent to Berlin, but was secretary to the Duke, and one of the
general postmasters.

(1408) Edward, only son of Thomas, Earl of Leicester, married
Mary, youngest daughter of John, Duke of Argyll, from whom he
was parted.  He died in 1752.

(1409) The Emperor kept a Lorrain regiment at Florence; but
there was little intercourse between the two nations.

(1410) With Count Richcourt.



542 Letter 247
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 26, 1748.

I have again talked over with our Chute the affair of Venice;
besides seeing no practicability in it, we think you will not
believe that Sir James Grey will be so simple as to leave
Venice, whither with difficulty he obtained to be sent, when
you hear that Mr. Legge(1411) has actually kissed hands, and
sets out on Friday for 'Berlin, as envoy extraordinary and
plenipotentiary.  We thought Sir Everard Falkener Sure; but
this has come forth very unexpectedly. Legge is certainly a
wiser choice'-, nobody has better parts; and if art and
industry can obtain success, I know no one would use more: but
I don't think that the King of Prussia,' with half parts and
much cunning, is so likely to be the dupe of more parts and as
much cunning-, as the people with whom Legge has so
prosperously pushed his fortune.  My father was fond of him to
the greatest degree of partiality, till he endeavoured to have
a nearer tie than flattery gave him, by trying to marry Lady
Mary: after that my lord could never bear his name.  Since
that. he has wiggled himself in with the Pelhams, by being the
warmest friend and servant of their new allies, and is the
first favourite of the little Duke of Bedford.  Mr.
Villiers(1412) was desired to go to Berlin, but refused and
proposed himself for the treasury, till they could find
something else for him.  They laughed at this; but he is as
fit for one employment as the other.  We have a stronger
reason than any I have mentioned against going to Venice;
which is, the excuse it might give to the Vine,(1413) to
forget we were in being; an excuse which his hatred of our
preferment would easily make him embrace, as more becoming a
good Christian brother!

The ministry are triumphant in their Parliament: there have
been great debates on the new taxes, but no division: the
House is now sitting on the Wareham election, espousing George
Pitt's uncle,(1414 one of the most active Jacobites, but of
the coalition and in place, against Drax,(1415) a great
favourite of the Prince, but who has already lost one question
on this election by a hundred.

Admiral Vernon has just published a series of letters to
himself(1416) among which are several of Lord Bath, written in
the height of his opposition: there is one in particular, to
congratulate Vernon on taking Portobello, wherein this great
Virtuous patriot advises him to do nothing more,(1417)
assuring him that his inactivity would all be imputed to my
father.  One does not hear that Lord Bath has called him to
any account for this publication, though as villainous to
these correspondents as one of them was in writing such a
letter; or as the Admiral himself was, who used to betray all
his instructions to this enemy of the government.  Nobody can
tell why he has published these letters now, unless to get
money.  What ample revenge every year gives my father against
his patriot enemies! Had he never deserved well
himself',posterity must still have the greatest opinion of
him, when they see on what rascal foundations were built all
the pretences to virtue which were set up in opposition to
him! Pultney counselling the Admiral who was entrusted with
the war not to pursue it, that its mismanagement might be
imputed to the minister; the Admiral communicating his orders
to such an enemy of his country! This enemy triumphant,
seizing honours and employments for himself and friends, which
he had @ avowedly disclaimed; other friends, whom he had
neglected, pursuing him for gratifying his
ambition-accomplishing his ruin, and prostituting themselves
even more than he had done! all of them blowing up a
rebellion, by every art that could blacken the King in the
eyes of the nation, and some of them promoting the trials and
sitting in judgment on the wretches whom they had misled and
deserted!  How black a picture! what odious portraits, when
time shall write the proper names under them!

As famous as you think your Mr. Mill, I can find nobody who
ever heard his name.  Projectors make little noise here; and
even any one who only has made a noise, is forgotten as soon
as out of sight.  The knaves and fools of the day are too
numerous to leave room to talk of yesterday.  The pains that
people, who have a mind to be named, are forced to take to be
very particular, would convince you how difficult it is to
make a lasting impression on such a town as this.  Ministers,
authors, wits, fools, patriots, prostitutes, scarce bear a
second edition.  Lord Bolingbroke, Sarah Malcolm,(1418) and
old Marlborough. are never mentioned but by elderly folks to
their grandchildren, who had never heard of them.  What would
last Pannoni's(1419) a twelvemonth is forgotten here ]it
twelve hours.  Good night!

(1411) Henry fourth son of the Earl of Dartmouth, was made
secretary of the treasury by Sir Robert Walpole; and was
afterwards surveyor of the roads, a lord of the admiralty, a
lord of the treasury, treasurer of the navy, and chancellor of
the exchequer.  He had been bred to the sea, and was for a
little time minister at Berlin.  The Duke of Newcastle, in a
letter to Mr. Pitt, of the 18th of January, says, " I have
thought of a person, to whom the King has this day readily
agreed.  It is Mr. Harry Legge.  There, is capacity,
integrity, quality, rank and address." See Chatham
Correspondence, vol. i. p. 27.-E.

(1412) Coxe, in his Memoirs of lord Walpole, says, that Mr.
Legge, though a man of great talents for business, "was unfit
for a foreign mission, and of a character ill suited to the
temper of that powerful casuist, whose extraordinary dogmas
were supported by 140,000 of the most effectual but convincing
arguments in the world." Vol. ii.  II. 304.-E.

(1413) Thomas Villiers, brother of the Earl of Jersey, had
been minister It Dresden, and was afterwards a lord of the
admiralty.

(1414) Anthony Chute, of the Vine, in Hampshire, elder brother
of J. Chute; died in 1754.

(1415) John Pitt, one of the lords of trade.

1416) Henry Drax, the Prince's secretary.  He died in 1755.

(1417) The publication was entitled " Letters to an Honest
Sailor."  Walpole's inference is not borne out by the letter
itself.  Pulteney's words; are, "Pursue your stroke, but venture
not losing the honour of it by too much intrepidity.  Should you
make no more progress than you have done, no one could blame
you but those persons only who ought to have sent some land-
forces with you, and did not.  To their slackness it will be
very justly imputed by all mankind, should you make no further
progress till Lord Cathcart joins you."-E.

(1418) A washerwoman at the Temple, executed for three
murders. (She was executed in March 1733, opposite Mitre
Court, in Fleet Street.  A portrait of her is given in the
Gentleman's Magazine for that year.  So great was the public
expectation for her confession, that the manuscript of it was
sold for twenty pounds.-E.)

(1419) The coffee-house at Florence.



544 Letter 248
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 16, 1748.

I am going to tell you nothing but what Mr. Chute has told you
already,-that my Lord Chesterfield has resigned the seals,
that the Duke of Newcastle has change] his province, and that
the Duke of Bedford is the new secretary of state.  I think
you need be under no apprehension from this change; I should
be frightened enough if you had the least reason, but I am
quite at ease.  Lord Chesterfield, who I believe had no
quarrel but with his partner, is gone to Bath; and his
youngest brother, John Stanhope,(1420) comes into the
admiralty, where Sandwich is now first lord.  There seems to
be some hitch in Legge's embassy; I believe we were overhasty.
Proposals of peace were expected to be laid before Parliament,
but that talk is vanished.  The Duke of Newcastle, who is
going greater lengths in every thing for which he overturned
Lord Granville, is all military; and makes more courts than
one by this disposition.  The Duke goes to Holland this week,
and I hear we are going to raise another million.  There are
prodigious discontents in the army: the town got a list of a
hundred and fifty officers who desired at once to resign, but
I believe this was exaggerated.  We are great and very exact
disciplinarians; our partialities are very strong, especially
on the side of aversions, and none of these articles tally
exactly with English tempers.  Lord Robert Bertie(1421)
received a reprimand the other day by an aide-de-camp for
blowing his nose as he relieved the guard under a
window;(1422) where very exact notice is constantly taken of
very small circumstances.

We divert ourselves extremely this winter; plays, balls,
masquerades, and pharaoh are all in fashion.  The Duchess of
Bedford has given a great ball, to which the King came with
thirty masks.  The Duchess of Queensberry is to give him a
masquerade.  Operas are the only consumptive entertainment.
There was a new comedy last Saturday, which succeeds, called
The Foundling.  I like the old Conscious lovers better, and
that not much.  The story is the same, only that the Bevil of
the new piece is in more hurry, and consequently more natural.
It Is extremely well acted by Garrick and Barry, Mrs. Cibber
and Mrs. Woffington.  My sister was brought to bed last night
of another boy.  Sir C. Williams, I hear, grows more likely to
go to Turin: you will have a more agreeable correspondent than
your present voluminous brother.(1423)  Adieu!

(1420) John Stanhope, third son of Philip, third Earl of
Chesterfield, successively M. P. for Nottingham and Dorhy.  He
died in 1748.-D.

(1421) Lord Robert Bertie was third son of Robert, first Duke
of Ancaster, by his second wife.  He became a general in the
army and colonel of the second regiment of Guards, and was
also a lord of the bedchamber and a member of parliament.  He
died in 1732.-D.

(1422) The Duke's.

(1423) Mr. Villettes.



545 Letter 249
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 11, 1748.

I have had nothing lately to tell you but illnesses and
distempers: there is what they call a miliary fever raging,
which has taken off a great many people, It was scarce known
till within these seven or eight years, but apparently
increases every spring and autumn.  They don't know how to
treat it, but think that they have discovered that bleeding is
bad for it.  The young Duke of Bridgewater(1424) is dead of
it. The Marquis of Powis(1425) is dead too, I don't know of
what: but though a Roman Catholic, he has left his whole
fortune to Lord herbert, the next male of his family, but a
very distant relation.  It is twelve thousand pounds a-year,
with a very rich mine upon it; there is a debt, but the money
and personal estate will pay it.  After Lord Herbert(1426) and
his brother, who are both unmarried, the estate is to go to
the daughter of Lord Waldegrave's sister, by her first
husband, who was the Marquis's brother.

In defiance of all these deaths, we are all diversions; Lady
Keith(1427) and a company of Scotch nobility have formed a
theatre, and have acted The Revenge several times; I can't say
excellently: the Prince and Princess were at it last night.
The Duchess of Queensberry gives a masquerade tonight, in
hopes of drawing the King to it; but he will not go.  I do;
but must own it is wondrous foolish to dress one's self out in
a becoming dress in cold blood.  There has been a new comedy
called The Foundling;(1428) far from good, but it took.  Lord
Hobart and some more young men made a party to damn it, merely
for the love of damnation.  The Templars espoused the play,
and went around with syringes charged with stinking oil, and
with sticking plaisters; but it did not come to action.
Garrick was impertinent, and the pretty men gave over their
plot the moment they grew to be in the right.

I must now notify to you the approaching espousals of the most
illustrious Prince Pigwiggin with Lady Rachel Cavendish, third
daughter of the Duke of Devonshire: the victim does not
dislike it! my uncle makes great settlements; and the Duke is
to get a peerage for Pigwiggin upon the foot that the father
cannot be spared out of the House of Commons!  Can you bear
this old buffoon making himself of consequence, and imitating
my father!

The Princess of Orange has got a son, and we have taken a
convoy that was going to Bergen-op-zoom; two trifling
occurrences that are most pompously exaggerated, when The
whole of both is, that the Dutch, who before sold themselves
to France, will now grow excellent patriots when they have a
master entailed upon them; and we shall run ourselves more
into danger, on having got all advantage which the French
don't feel.

Violent animosities are sprung up in the House of Commons upon
a sort of private affair between the Chief Justice Willes and
the Grenvilles, who have engaged the ministry in an
extraordinary step, of fixing the assizes at Buckingham by act
of parliament in their favour.  We have had three long days
upon it in our House, and it is not yet over; but though they
will carry it both there and in the lords, it is by a far
smaller majority than any they have had in this
Parliament.(1429)  The other day, Dr. Lee and Mr. Potter had
made two very strong speeches @-against Mr. Pelham on this
subject; he rose with the greatest emotion, fell into the most
ridiculous passion, was near crying, and not knowing how to
return it on the two fell upon the Chief Justice (who was not
present), and accused him of ingratitude.  The eldest Willes
got up extremely moved, but with great propriety and
cleverness told Mr. Pelham that his father had no obligation
to any man now in the ministry; that he had been obliged to
one of' the greatest Ministers that ever was, who is now no
more; that the person who accused his father of ingratitude
was now leagued with the very men who had ruined that
minister, to whom he (Mr.  Pelham) owed his advancement, and
without whom he would have been nothing!" This was
dangers!-not a word of reply.

I had begun my letter before the masquerade, but had not time
to finish it: there Were not above one hundred persons; the
dresses pretty; the Duchess as mad as you remember her.  She
had stuck up orders about dancing, as you see in public
bowling-greens; turned half the company out at twelve; kept
those she liked to supper; and, in short, contrived to do an
agreeable thing in the rudest manner imaginable; besides
having dressed her husband in a Scotch plaid, which just now
is One of the things in the world that is reckoned most
offensive; but you know we are all mad, so good night!

(1424) John Egerton, second Duke of Bridgewater, eldest
surviving son of Scroop, the first Duke, by his second wife,
Lady Rachel Russell. He was succeeded by his younger brother
Francis; upon whose death, in 1803, the dukedom of Bridgewater
became extinct.-D.

(1425) William Herbert, second Marquis of Powis, upon whose
death the title became extinct.  His father, William, the
First Marquis, was created Duke of Powis and Marquis of
Montgomery, by James the Second, after his abdication, which
titles were in consequence never allowed.-]).

(1426) Henry Arthur Herbert, Lord Herbert, afterwards created
Earl of Powis, married the young lady on whom the estate was
entailed: his brother died unmarried.

(1427) Caroline, eldest daughter of John, Duke of Argyll,
married the eldest son of the Duke of Buccleuch, who dying
before his father, she afterwards married Charles Townshend,
second son of the Lord Viscount Townshend. (She was created
Baroness Greenwich in 1767.-D.

its run, but on the first night of its appearance the
character of Faddle gave considerable disgust, and was much
curtailed in the ensuing representation.-E.

155 to 108.  For the debate thereon, see Parliamentary

547 Letter 250
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 29, 1748.

I know I have not writ to you the Lord knows when, but I
waited for something to tell you, and I have now what there
was not much reason to expect.  The preliminaries to the peace
are actually signed"(1430) by the English, Dutch, and French:
the Queen,(1431) who would remain the only sufferer, though
vastly less than she could expect, protests against this
treaty, and the Sardinian minister has refused to sign too,
till further orders.  Spain is not mentioned, but France
answers for them, and that they shall give us a new assiento.
The armistice is for six weeks, with an exception to
Maestricht; upon which the Duke sent Lord George Sackville to
Marshal Saxe to tell him that, as they are so near being
friends, he shall not endeavour to raise the siege and spill
more blood, but hopes the marshal will give the garrison good
terms, as they have behaved so bravely.  The conditions
settled are a general restitution on all sides, as Modena to
its Duke, Flanders to the Queen, the Dutch towns to the Dutch,
Cape Breton to France, and Final to the Genoese; but the
Sardinian to have the cessions made to him by the Queen, who,
you see, is to be made observe the treaty of Worms, though we
do not.  Parma and Placentia are to be given to Don Philip;
Dunkirk to remain as it is, on the land-side; but to be
Utrecht'd(1432) again to the sea.  The Pretender to be
renounced, with all his descendants, male and female, even in
stronger terms than by the quadruple alliance; and the
cessation of arms to take place in all other parts of the
world, as in the year 1712.  The contracting powers agree to
think of means of making the other powers come into this
treaty, in case they refuse.

This is the substance; and wonderful it is what can make the
French give us such terms, or why they have lost so much blood
and treasure to so little purpose! for they have destroyed
very little of the fortifications in Flanders.  Monsieur de
St. Severin told Lord Sandwich, that he had full powers to
sign now, but that the same courier that should carry our
refusal, was to call at Namur and Bergen-op-zoom, where are
mines under all the works, which were immediately to be blown
up.  There is no accounting for this, but from the King'S
aversion to go to the army, and to Marshal Saxe's fear of
losing his power with the loss of a battle.  He told Count
Flemming, the Saxon minister, who asked him if the French were
in earnest in their offer of peace, "Il est vrai, nous
demandons la paix comme des l`aches, et ne pouvons pas
l'obtenir."

Stocks rise; the ministry are in spirits, and ;e s'en faut but
we shall admire this peace as our own doing!  I believe two
reasons that greatly advanced it are, the King's wanting to go
to Hanover, and the Duke's wanting to go into a salivation.

We had last night the most magnificent masquerade that ever
was seen: it was by Subscription at the Haymarket: every body
who subscribed five guineas had four tickets.  There were
about seven hundred people, all in chosen and very fine
dresses.  The supper was in two rooms, besides those for the
King and Prince, who, with the foreign ministers, had tickets
given them.

You don't tell me whether the seal of which you sent me the
impression, is to be sold: I think it fine, but not equal to
the price which you say was paid for it.  What is it? Homer or
Pindar?

I am very miserable at the little prospect you have of success
in your own affair: I think the person(1433) you employed has
used you scandalously. I would have you write to my uncle; but
my applying to him would be far from doing you service.  Poor
Mr. Chute has
got so bad a cold that he could not go last night to the
masquerade.  Adieu! my dear child! there is nothing -well that
I don't wish you, but my wishes are very ineffectual!

549 Letter 251
To George Montagu, Esq.
May 18, 1748.

Here I am with the poor Chutehed,(1434) who has put on a shoe
but to-day for the first time.  He sits at the receipt of
custom, and one passes most part, of the day here; the other
part I have the misfortune to pass en Pigwiggin.  The ceremony
of dining is not over yet: I cannot say that either the Prince
or the Princess look the comelier for what has happened.  The
town says, my Lady Anson(1435) has no chance for looking
different from what she did before she was married: and they
have a story of a gentleman going to the Chancellor to assure
him, that if he gave his daughter to the Admiral, he would be
obliged hereafter to pronounce a sentence of dissolution of
the marriage.  The Chancellor replied, that his daughter had
been taught to think of the union of the soul, not of the
body: the gentleman then made the same confidence to the
Chancelloress, and received much such an answer: that her
daughter had been bred to submit herself to the will of God.
I don't at all give you all this for true; but there is an
ugly circumstance in his voyages of his not having the
curiosity to see a beautiful captive, that he took on board a
Spanish ship.  There is no record of Scipio's having been in
Doctors' Commons.  I have been reading these voyages, and find
them very silly and contradictory.  He sets out with telling
you, that he had no soldiers sent with him but old invalids
without legs or arms; and then in the middle of' the book
there is a whole chapter to tell you what they would have done
if they had set out two months sooner, and that was no less
than conquering Peru and Mexico -with this disabled army.  At
the end there is an account of the neglect he received from
the Viceroy of Canton, till he and forty of his sailors put
out a great fire in that city, which the Chinese and five
hundred firemen could not do, which he says proceeded from
their awkwardness; a new character of the Chinese! He was then
admitted to an audience, and found two hundred men at the gate
of the city, and ten thousand in the square before the palace,
all new dressed for the purpose.  This is about as true as his
predecessor Gulliver * -* * out the fire at Lilliput.  The
King is still wind-bound; the fashionable bon mot is, that the
Duke of Newcastle has tied a stone about his neck and sent him
to sea.  The city grows furious about the peace; there is one
or two very uncouth Hanover articles, besides a persuasion of
a pension to the Pretender, which is so very ignominious, that
I don't know how to persuade myself it is true.  The Duke of
Argyle has made them give him three places for life of a
thousand and twelve hundred a-year for three of his court, to
compensate for their making a man president of the session
against his inclination.  the Princess of Wales has got a
confirmed jaundice, but they reckon her much better.  Sir
Harry Calthrop is gone mad: he walked down Pall Mall t'other
day with his red riband tied about his hair said he was going
to the King, and would not submit to be blooded till they told
him the King commanded it.

I went yesterday to see Marshal Wade's house, which is selling
by auction: it is worse contrived on the inside than is
conceivable, all to humour the beauty of the front.  My Lord
Chesterfield said, that to be sure he could not live in it,
but intended to take the house over against it to look at it.
It is literally true, that all the direction he gave my Lord
Burlington was to have a place for a cartoon of Rubens that he
bought in Flanders; but my lord found it necessary to have so
many correspondent doors, that there was no room at last for
the picture; and the Marshal was forced to sell the picture to
my father: it is now at Houghton.(1436)

As Windsor is so charming, and particularly as you have got so
agreeable a new neighbour at Frogmore, to be sure you cannot
wish to have the prohibition taken off on your coming to
Strawberry Hill.  However, as I am an admirable Christian, and
as you seem to repent of your errors, I will give you leave to
be so happy as to come to me when you like, though I would
advise it to be after you have been at Roel,(1437) winch you
would not be able to bear after my paradise.  I have told you
a vast deal of something or other, which you will scarce be
able to read; for now Mr. Chute has the gout, he keeps himself
very low and lives upon very thin ink.  My compliments to all
your people.  Yours ever.

(1434) John Chute, Esq. of the Vine of Hampshire.

(1435) Lord Anson married, on the 25th of April, Lady
Elizabeth Yorke, Lord Chancellor Hardwicke's eldest daughter,
an ingenious woman and a poetess.  She died without issue in
1760.-E.

(1436) Walpole gives the following account of this picture, in
his description of Houghton:- "Meleager and Atalanta, a
cartoon, by Rubens, larger than life; brought out of Flanders
by Wade: it being designed for tapestry, all the weapons are
in the left hand of the figure.  For the story, see Ovid's
Metamorphoses, lib. 3. When General Wade built his house in
Burlington Garden, Lord Burlington gave the design for it."-E

550 Letter 252
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 26, 1748.

Good-by to YOU!  I am going to my Roel too.  I was there
yesterday to dine, and it looked so delightful, think what you
will, that I shall go there to-morrow to settle, and shall
leave this odious town to the * * *, to the regency, and the
dowagers; to my lady Townshend, who is not going to Windsor,
to old Cobham, who is not going out of the world yet, and to
the Duchess of Richmond, who does not -,go out with her
twenty-fifth pregnancy: I shall leave too more disagreeable
Ranelagh, which is so crowded, that going there t'other night
in a string of coaches we had a stop of six-and-thirty
Minutes.  Princess Emily, finding no marriage articles for her
settled at the congress, has at last determined to be old and
out of danger; and has accordingly ventured to Ranelagh to the
great improvement of the pleasures of the place.  The Prince
has given a silver cup to be rowed for, which carried every
body up the Thames. and afterwards there was a great ball at
Carlton house. There have two good events happened at that
court: the town was alarmed t'other morning by the firing of
guns, which proved to be only from a large merchantman come
into the river.  The city construed it into the King's return,
and the peace broke; but Chancellor Bootle and the Bishop of
Oxford, who loves a tabour next to promoting the cause of it,
concluded the Princess was brought to bed, and went to court
upon it.  Bootle, finding the Princess dressed, said, "I have
always heard, Madam, that women in your country have very easy
labours; but I could not have believed it was so well as I
see." The other story is of Prince Edward.  The King, before
he went away, sent Stainberg to examine the Prince's children
in their learning.  The Baron told Prince Edward, that he
should tell the King, what great proficiency his Highness had
made in his Latin, but that he wished he would be a little
more perfect in his German grammar, and that would be of
signal use to him.  The child squinted at him, and said,
"German grammar! why any dull child can learn that." There, I
have told you royalties enough!

My Pigwiggin dinners are all over, for which I truly say
grace.  I have had difficulties to keep my countenance at the
wonderful clumsiness and uncouth nicknames that the Duke has
for all his offspring: Mrs. Hopefull, Mrs. Tiddle, Puss, Cat,
and Toe, sound so strange in the middle of a most formal
banquet! The day the peace was signed, his grace could find
nobody to communicate joy with him: he drove home, and bawled
out of the chariot to Lady Rachael, "Cat! Cat!" She ran down,
staring over the balustrade; he cried, "Cat! Cat! the peace is
made, and you must be very glad, for I am very glad."

I send you the only new pamphlet worth reading, and this is
more the matter than the manner.  My compliments to all your
tribe.  Adieu!

P. S. The divine Asheton has got an ague, which he says
prevents his coming amongst us.



551 Letter 253
To sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 7, 1748.

Don't reproach me in your own Mind for not writing, but
reproach the world for doing nothing; for making peace as
slowly as they made war.  When any body commits an event, I am
ready enough to tell it you; but I have always declared
against inventing news; when I do, I will set up a newspaper.

The Duke of Newcastle is not gone; he has kissed hands, and
talks of going this week: the time presses, and he has not
above three days left to fall dangerously ill.  There are a
thousand wagers laid against his going: he has hired a
transport, for the yacht s not big enough to convey all the
tables and chairs and conveniences that he trails along with
him, and which he seems to think don't grow out of England.  I
don't know how he proposes to lug them through Holland and
Germany, though any objections that the map can make to his
progress don't count, for he is literally so ignorant, that
when one goes to take leave of him, he asks your commands into
the north, concluding that Hanover is north of Great Britain,
because it is in the northern province, which he has just
taken: you will scarce believe this, but upon my honour it is
true.

The preliminaries wait the accession of Spain, before they can
ripen into peace. Niccolini goes to Aix-la-Chapelle, and will
be much disappointed if his advice is not asked there: he
talks of being at Florence in October.

Sir William Stanhope has just given a great ball to Lady
Petersham, to whom he takes extremely, since his daughter
married herself to Mr. Ellis,(1438) and as the Petershams are
relations, they propose to be his heirs.  The Chuteheds agreed
with me, that the house, which is most magnificently
furnished, all the ornaments designed by Kent, and the whole
festino, puts us more in mind of Florence, than any thing we
had seen here.  There were silver-pharaoh and whist for the
ladies that did not dance, deep basset and quinze for the men;
the supper very fine.

I am now returning to my villa, where I have been making some
alterations: you shall hear from me from Strawberry Hill,
which I have found out in my lease is the old name of my
house; so pray, never call it Twickenham again.  I like to be
there better than I have liked being any where since I came to
England.  I sigh after Florence, and wind up all my prospects
with the thought of returning there.  I have days when I even
set about contriving a scheme for going to you, and though I
don't love to put you upon expecting me, I cannot help telling
you, that I wish more than ever to be with you again.  I can
truly say, that I never was happy but at Florence, and you
must allow that it is very natural to wish to be happy once
more.  Adieu!

Mendip.  His first wife was Elizabeth, only daughter of Sir

553 Letter 254
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(1439)
Strawberry Hill, June 27th, 1748.

Dear Harry,
I have full as little matter for writing as you can find in a
camp.  I do not call myself farmer or country gentleman; for
though I have all the ingredients to compose those characters,
yet, like the ten pieces of card in the trick you found out, I
don't know how to put them together.  But, in short, planting
and fowls and cows and sheep are my whole business, and as
little amusing to relate to anybody else as the events of a
stillborn campaign.  If I write to any body, I am forced to
live upon what news I hoarded before I came out of town;
and the first article of that, as I believe it is in every
body's gazette, must be about my Lord Coke.  They say, that
since he has been at Sunning Hill with Lady Mary,(1440 she has
made him a declaration in form, that she hates him, that she
always did, and that she always will.  This seems to have been
a very unnecessary notification.  However, as you know his
part is to be extremely in love, he is very miserable upon it;
and relating his woes at White's, probably at seven in the
morning, he was advised to put an end to all this history and
shoot himself-an advice
they would not have given him if he were not insolvent.  He
has promised to consider of it.

The night before I left London, I called at the Duchess of
Richmond's, who has stayed at home with the apprehension of a
miscarriage.  The porter told me there was no drawing-room
till Thursday.  In short, he did tell me what amounted to as
much, that her grace did not see company till Thursday, then
she should see every body: no excuse, that she was gone out or
not well.  I did not stay till Thursday to kiss hands, but
went away to Vauxhall: as I was coming out, I was overtaken by
a great light, and retired under the trees of Marble Hall to
see what it should be.  There came a long procession of Prince
Lobkowitz's footmen in very rich new liveries, the two last
bearing torches; and after them the Prince himself', in a new
sky-blue watered tabby Coat, with gold buttonholes and a
magnificent gold waistcoat fringed, leading Madame
ambassadrice de Venise in a green sack with a straw hat,
attended by my Lady Tyrawley, Wall, the private
 Spanish agent, the two Miss Molyneux's, and some other men.
They went into one of the Prince of Wales's barges, had
another barge filled with violins and hautboys, and an open
boat with drums and trumpets. This was one of the f`etes des
adieux.  The nymph weeps all the morning and says she is sure
she shall be poisoned by her husband's relations when she
returns for her behaviour with this Prince.

I have no other news, but that Mr. Fitzpatrick has married his
Sukey Young, and is very impatient to have the Duchess of
Bedford come to town to visit her new relation.

Is not my Lady Ailesbury(1442) weary of her travels? Pray make
her my compliments,-unless she has made you any such
declaration as Lady Mary Coke's.  I am delighted with your
description of the bedchamber of the House of Orange, as I did
not see it; but the sight itself must have been very odious,
as the hero and heroine are so extremely ugly.  I shall give
it my Lady Townshend as a new topic of matrimonial satire.

Mr. Churchill and Lady Mary have been with me two or three
days, and are now gone to Sunning.  I only tell you this, to
hint that my house will hold a married pair; indeed, it is not
quite large enough for people who lie, like the patriarchs,
with their whole genealogy, and men-servants, and
maid-servants, and oxes, and asses, in the same chamber with
them.  Adieu! do let this be the last letter, and come home.

554 Letter 255
To Sir Horace Mann.
Mistley, July 14, 1748.


I would by no means resent your silence while you was at Pisa,
if it were not very convenient; but I cannot resist 'the
opportunity of taking it ill, when it serves to excuse my
being much more to blame; and therefore, pray mind, I am very
angry, and have not written, because you had quite left me
off-and if I say nothing from hence,(1443) do not imagine it
is because I am at a gentleman's house whom you don't know,
and threescore miles from London, and because I have been but
three days in London for above this month: I could say a great
deal if I pleased, but I am very angry, and will not.  I know
several pieces of politics from Ipswich that would let you
into the whole secret of the peace; and a quarrel at Denham
assembly, that is capable of involving all Europe in a new
war-nay, I know that Admiral Vernon(1444) knows of what you
say has happened in the West Indies, and of which nobody else
in England knows a word-but please to remember that you have
been at the baths, and don't deserve that I should tell you a
tittle-nor will I. In revenge, I will tell you some- thing
that happened to me four months ago, and which I would not
tell you now. if I had not forgot to tell it you when it
happened-nay, I don't tell it you now for yourself, only that
you may tell it the Princess: I truly and seriously this
winter won and was paid a milleleva at pharaoh; literally
received a thousand and twenty-three sixpences for one: an
event that never happened in the annals of pharaoh, but to
Charles II.'s Queen Dowager, as the Princess herself informed
me: ever since I have treated myself as Queen Dowager, and
have some thoughts of being drawn so.

There are no good anecdotes yet arrived of the Duke of
Newcastle's travels, except that at a review which the Duke
made for him, as he passed through the army, he hurried about
with his glass up to his eye, crying, "Finest troops! finest
troops! greatest General!" then broke through the ranks when
he spied any Sussex man, kissed him in all his
accoutrements,-my dear Tom such an one! chattered of Lewes
races; then back to the Duke with "Finest troops! greatest
General!"-and in short was a much better show than any review.

The Duke is expected over immediately; I don't know if to
stay, or why he comes-I mean, I do know, but am angry, and
will not tell.

I have seen Sir James Grey, who speaks of you with great
affection, and recommends himself extremely to me by it, when
I am not angry with you; but I cannot possibly be reconciled
till I have finished this letter, for I have nothing but this
quarrel to talk of, and I think I have worn that out-so adieu!
you odious, shocking, abominable monster!

555 Letter 256
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, ---

I beg you will let me know whether the peace has arrived in
Italy, or if you have heard any thing of it; for in this part
of the world nobody can tell what has become of it.  They say
the Empress Queen has stopped it; that she will not take back
the towns in Flanders, which she says she knows are very
convenient for us, but of no kind of use to her, and that she
chooses to keep what she has got in Italy.  However, we are
determined to have peace at any rate, and the conditions must
jumble themselves together as they can.  These are the
politics of Twickenham, my metropolis; and, to tell you the
truth, I believe pretty near as good as you can have any
where.

As to my own history, the scene is at present a little gloomy:
my Lord Orford is in an extreme bad state of health, not to
say a dangerous state: my uncle(1445) ' is going off in the
same way my father did.  I don't pretend to any great feelings
of affection for two men, because they are dying, for whom it
is known I had little before, my brother especially having
been as much my enemy as it was in his power to be; but I
cannot with indifference see the family torn to pieces, and
falling into such ruin as I foresee; for should my brother die
soon, leaving so great a debt, so small an estate to pay it
off, two great places(1446)
sinking, and a wild boy of nineteen to succeed, there would be
an end to the glory of Houghton, which had my father
proportioned more to his fortune, would probably have a longer
duration.  This is an unpleasant topic to you who feel for
us-however, I should not talk of it to one who would not feel.
Your brother Gal. and I had a very grave conversation
yesterday morning on this head; he thinks so like you, so
reasonably and with so much good nature, that I seem to be
only finishing a discourse that I have already had with you.
As my fears about Houghton are great, I am a little pleased to
have finished a slight memorial(1447) of It, a description of
the pictures, of which I have just printed an hundred, to give
to particular people: I will send you one, and shall beg Dr.
Cocchi to accept another.

If I could let myself wish to see you in England, it would be
to see you here: the little improvements I am making have
really turned Strawberry Hill into a charming villa: Mr.
Chute, I hope, will tell you how pleasant it is; I mean
literally tell you, for we have a glimmering of' a Venetian
prospect; he is just going from hence to town by water, down
our Brenta.

You never say a word to me from the Princess, nor any of my
old friends: I keep up our intimacy in my own mind; for I will
not part with the idea of seeing Florence again.  Whenever I
am displeased here, the thoughts of that journey are my
resource; just as cross would-be devout people, when they have
quarrelled with this world, begin packing up for the other.
Adieu!

556 Letter 257
To George Montagu, Esq.
Mistley, July 25, 1748.

Dear George,
I have wished you with me extremely: you would have liked what
I have seen.  I have been to make a visit of two or three days
to Nugent, and was carried to see the last remains of the
glory of the old Aubrey de Veres, Earls of Oxford.  They were
once masters of' almost this entire county, but quite reduced
even before the extinction of their house: the last Earl's son
died at a miserable cottage, that I was shown at a distance;
and I think another of the sisters, besides Lady Mary Vere,
was forced to live upon her beauty.

Henningham Castle, where Harry the Seventh(1448) was so
sumptuously banqueted, and imposed that villainous fine for
his entertainment, is now shrunk to one vast curious tower,
that stands on a spacious mount raised on a high hill with a
large fosse.  It commands a fine prospect, and belongs to Mr.
Ashurst, a rich citizen, who has built a trumpery new house
close to it.  In the parish church is a fine square monument
of black marble of one of the Earls; and there are three more
tombs of the family at Earl's Colne, some miles from the
castle.  I could see but little of them, as it was very late,
except that one of the Countesses has a headdress exactly like
the description of Mount Parnassus, with two tops.  I suppose
you have heard much of Gosfield, Nugent's seat.  It is
extremely in fashion, but did not answer to me, though there
are fine things about it; but being situated in a country that
is quite blocked up with hills upon hills, and even too much
wood, it has not an inch of prospect.  The park is to be
sixteen hundred acres, and is bounded with a wood of five
miles round; and the lake, which is very beautiful, is of
seventy acres, directly in a line with the house, at the
bottom of a fine lawn, and broke with very pretty groves, that
fall down a Slope into it.  The house is vast, built round a
very old court that has never been fine; the old windows and
gateway left, and the old gallery, which is a bad narrow room,
and hung with all the late patriots, but so ill done, that
they look like caricatures done to expose them, since they
have so much disgraced the virtues they pretended to.  The
rest of the house is all modernized, but in patches, and in
the bad taste that came between the charming venerable Gothic
and pure architecture.  There is a great deal of good
furniture, but no one room very fine - no tolerable pictures.
Her dressing-room is very pretty, and furnished with white
damask, china, japan, loads of easy chairs, bad pictures, and
some pretty enamels.  But what charmed me more than all I had
seen, is the library chimney, which has existed from the
foundation of the house; over it is an alto-relievo in wood,
far from being ill done, of the battle of Bosworth Field.  It
is all white, except the helmets and trappings, which are
gilt, and the shields, which are properly blazoned with the
arms of all the chiefs engaged.  You would adore it.

We passed our time very agreeably; both Nugent and his wife
are very good-humoured, and easy in their house to a degree.
There was nobody else but the Marquis of Tweedale; his new
Marchioness,(1451) who is infinitely good-humoured and good
company, and sang a thousand French songs mighty prettily; a
sister of Nugent's, who does not figure; and a Mrs.
Elliot,(1452) sister to Mrs. Nugent, who crossed over and
figured in with Nugent: I mean she has turned Catholic, as he
has Protestant.  She has built herself a very pretty small
house in the path-, and is only a daily visiter.  Nugent was
extremely communicative of his own labours; repeated us an ode
of ten thousand stanzas to abuse Messieurs de la Gallerie, and
reid me a whole tragedy, which has really a great many @
pretty things in it; not indeed equal to his glorious ode on
religion and liberty, but with many of those absurdities which
are so blended with his parts.  We were overturned coming
back, but, thank YOU, we were not it all hurt, and have been
to-day to see a large house and a pretty park, belonging to a
Mr. Williams; it is to be sold.  You have seen in the papers
that Dr.  Bloxholme is dead.  He cut his throat.  He always
was nervous and vapoured; and so good-natured, that he left
off his practice from not being able to bear seeing so many
melancholy objects.  I remember him with as much wit as ever I
knew; there was a pretty correspondence of Latin odes that
passed between him and Hodges.

You will be diverted to hear that the Duchess of Newcastle was
received at Calais by Locheil's regiment under arms, who did
duty himself while she stayed.  The Duke of Grafton is going
to Scarborough; don't you love that endless back-stairs
policy? and at his time of life!  This fit of ill health is
arrived on the Prince's going to shoot for a fortnight at
Thetford, and his grace is afraid of not being civil enough or
too civil.

Since I wrote my letter I have been fishing in Rapin for any
Particulars relating to the Veres, and have already found that
Robert de Vere,(1453) the great Duke of Ireland, and favourite
of Richard the Second, is buried at Earl's COlnE, and probably
under one of the tombs I saw there; I long to be certain that
the lady with the strange coiffure is Lancerona, the joiner's
daughter, that he married after divorcing a princess of the
blood for her.  I have found, too, that King Stephen's Queen
died at Henningham, a castle belonging to Alberic de
Vere:,(1454) in short, I am just now Vere mad, and extremely
mortified to have Lancerona and lady Vere Beauclerk's,
Portuguese grandmother blended with this brave old blood.
Adieu! I go to town the day after to-morrow, and immediately
from thence to Strawberry Hill.  Yours ever.

(1448) See Hume's History of England, vol. iii. p. 399. ["The
Earl of Oxford, his favourite general, having splendidly
entertained him at his castle of Henningham, was desirous of
making a parade of his magnificence at the departure of his
royal guest; and ordered all his retainers, with their
liveries and badges, to be drawn up in two lines, that their
appearance might be the more gallant and splendid.  'My lord,'
said the King, 'I have heard much of your hospitality; but the
truth far exceeds the report: these handsome gentlemen and
yeomen whom I see on both sides of me are no doubt your menial
servants.' The Earl smiled, and confessed that his fortune was
too narrow for such magnificence.  'They are most of them,'
subjoined he, 'my retainers, who are come to do service at
this time, when they know I am honoured with your Majesty's
presence.'  The King started a little, and said, 'By my faith!
my lord, I thank you for your good cheer, but I must not allow
my laws to be broken in my sight: my attorney must speak with
you.' Oxford is said to have paid no less than fifteen
thousand marks, as a compensation for his offence.")

558 Letter 258
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Aug. 11, 1748.

I am arrived at great knowledge in the annals of the house of
Vere but though I have twisted and twined their genealogy and
my own a thousand ways, I cannot discover, as I wished to do,
that I am descended from them any how but from one of their
Christian names the name of Horace having travelled from them
into Norfolk by the marriage of a daughter of Horace Lord Vere
of Tilbury with a Sir Roger Townshend, whose family baptised
some of us with it.  But I have made a really curious
discovery! the lady with the strange dress at Earl's Colne,
which I mentioned to you, is certainly Lancerona, the
Portuguese-for I have found in Rapin, from one of the old
chronicles, that Anne of Bohemia, to whom she had been Maid of
Honour, introduced the fashion of piked horns, or high heads,
which is the very attire on this tomb, and ascertains it to
belong to Robert de Vere, the great Earl of Oxford, made Duke
of Ireland by Richard II., who, after the banishment of this
Minister, and his death at Louvain, occasioned by a boar at a
hunting match, caused the body to be brought over, would have
the coffin opened once more to see his favourite, and attended
it himself in high procession to its interment at Earl's
Colne.  I don't know whether the "Craftsman" some years ago
would not have found out that we were descended from this
Vere, at least from his name and ministry: my comfort is, that
Lancerona was Earl Robert's second wife.  But in this search I
have crossed upon another descent, which I am taking great
pains to verify (I don't mean a pun)., and that is a
probability of my being descended from Chaucer, whose
daughter, the Lady Alice, before her espousals with Thomas
Montagute,'Earl of Salisbury, and afterwards with William de
la Pole, the great Duke of Suffolk, (another famous
favourite), was married to a Sir John Philips, who I hope to
find was of Picton Castle, and had children by her; but I have
not yet brought these matters to a consistency.  mr. Chute is
persuaded I shall, for he says any body with two or three
hundred years of pedigree may find themselves descended from
whom they please; and thank my stars and my good cousin, the
present Sir John] Philips,(1454) I have a sufficient pedigree
to work upon; for he drew us up one by which Ego et rex mems
are derived hand in hand from Cadwallader, and the English
baronetage says from the Emperor Maximus (by the Philips's,
who are Welsh, s'entend).  These Veres have thrown me into a
deal of this old study: t'other night I was reading to Mrs.
Leneve and Mrs. Pigot,(1455) who has been here a few days, the
description in Hall's Chronicle of the meeting of Harry VIII.
and Francis I. which is so delightfully painted in your
Windsor.  We came to a paragraph, which I must transcribe; for
though it means nothing in the world, it is so ridiculously
worded in the old English that it made us laugh for three
days.!

and the wer twoo kinges served with a banket and after mirthe,
had communication in the banket time, and there sheweth the
one the other their pleasure.

Would not one swear that old Hal showed all that is showed in
the Tower? I am now in the act of expecting the house of
Pritchard,(1456) Dame Clive,(1457) and Mrs. Metheglin to
dinner.  I promise you the Clive, and I will not show one
another our pleasure during the banket time nor afterwards.
In the evening, we go to a play at Kingston, where the places
are two pence a head.  Our great company at Richmond and
Twickenham has been torn to pieces by civil dissensions, but
they continue acting.  Mr. Lee, the ape of Garrick, not liking
his part, refused to play it, and had the confidence to go
into the pit as spectator.  The actress, whose benefit was in
agitation, made her complaints to the audience, who obliged
him to mount the stage; but since that he has retired from the
company.  I am sorry he was such a coxcomb, for he was the
best. . . .

You say, why won't I go to Lady Mary's?(1458)  I say, why
won't you go to the Talbots? Mary is busied about many things,
is dancing the hays between three houses; but I will go with
you for a day or two to the Talbots if you like it. and you
shall come hither to fetch me. I have been to see Mr.
Hamilton's, near Cobham, where he has really made a fine place
out of a most cursed hill.  Esher(1459) I have seen again
twice, and prefer it to all villas, even to Southcote's--Kent
is Kentissing there.  I have been laughing too at Claremont
house; the gardens are improved since I saw them: do you know
that the pineapples are literally sent to Hanover by couriers!
I am serious.  Since the Duke of Newcastle went, and upon the
news of the Duke of Somerset's illness, he has transmitted his
commands through the King, and by him through the Bedford to
the University of Cambridge to forbid their electing any body,
but the most ridiculous person they could elect, his grace of
Newcastle.  The Prince hearing this, has written to them, that
having heard his Majesty's commands, he should by no means
oppose them.  This is sensible: but how do the two secretaries
answer such a violent act of authority?  Nolkojumskoi(1460)
has let down his dignity and his discipline, and invites
continually all officers that are members of parliament.
Doddington's sentence of expulsion is sealed: Lyttelton is to
have his place (the second time he has tripped up his heels);
Lord Barrington is to go to the treasury, and Dick Edgecumbe
into the admiralty.

Rigby is gone from hence to Sir William Stanhope's to the
Aylesbury races, where the Grenvilles and Peggy Banks design
to appear and avow their triumph.  Gray has been here a few
days, and is transported with your story of Madame Bentley's
diving, and her white man, and in short with all your stories.
Room for cuckolds--here comes my company--

Aug. 15?.

I had not time to finish my letter last night, for we did not
return from the dismal play, which was in a barn at Kingston,
till twelve o'clock at night.  Our dinner passed off very
well; the Clive was very good company; you know how much she
admires Asheton's preaching.  She says, she is always vastly
good for two or three days after his sermons;' but by the time
that Thursday comes, all their effect is worn out.  I never
saw more proper decent behaviour than Mrs. Pritchard's, and I
assure you even Mr. Treasurer Pritchard was far better than I
expected.  Yours ever, Chaucerides.

(1454) The grandmother of the Hon. Horace Walpole was daughter
of sir Erasmus Philips, of Picton Castle in Pembrokeshire.

561 Letter 259
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Strawberry Hill, Aug. 29, 1748.

Dear Harry,
Whatever you may think, a campaign at Twickenham furnishes as
little matter for a letter as an abortive one in Flanders.  I
can't say indeed that my generals wear black wigs, but they
have long full- bottomed hoods which cover as little
entertainment to the full.

There's General my Lady Castlecomer, and General my Lady
Dowager Ferrers! Why, do you think I can extract more out of
them than you can out of Hawley or Honeywood?(1461)  Your old
women dress, go to the Duke's levee, see that the soldiers
cock their hats right, sleep after dinner, and soak with their
led-captains till bed-time, and tell a thousand lies of what
they never did in their youth.  Change hats for head-clothes,
the rounds for visits, and led-captains for toad-eaters, and
the life is the very same.  In short, these are the people I
live in the midst of, though not with; and it is for want of
more important histories that I have wrote to you seldom; not,
I give you my word, from the least negligence.  My present and
sole occupation is planting, in which I have made great
progress, and talk very learnedly with the nurserymen, except
that now and then a lettuce run to seed overturns all my
botany, as I have more than once taken it for a curious
West-Indian flowering shrub.  Then the deliberation with which
trees grow, is extremely inconvenient to my natural
impatience.  I lament living in so barbarous an age, when we
are come to so little perfection in gardening.  I am persuaded
that a hundred and fifty years hence it will be as common to
remove oaks a hundred and fifty years old, as it is now to
transplant tulip-roots.  I have even begun a treatise or
panegyric on the great discoveries made by posterity in all
arts and sciences, wherein I shall particularly descant on the
great and cheap convenience of making trout-rivers-One Of the
improvements which Mrs. Kerwood wondered Mr. Hedges would not
make at his country-house, but which was not then quite so
common as it will be.  I shall talk of a secret for roasting a
wild-boar and a whole pack of hounds alive, without hurting
them, so that the whole chase may be brought up to table; and
for this secret, the Duke of Newcastle's grandson, if he can
ever get a son, is to give a hundred thousand pounds.  Then
the delightfulness of having whole groves of hummingbirds,
tame tigers taught to fetch and carry, pocket spying-glasses
to see all that is doing in China, with a thousand other toys,
which we now look upon as impracticable, and which pert
posterity would laugh in one's face for staring at, while they
are offering rewards for perfecting discoveries, of the
principles of which we have not the least conception!  If ever
this book should come forth, I must expect to have all the
learned in arms against me, who measure all knowledge
backward: some of them have discovered symptoms of all arts in
Homer; and Pineda(1462) had so much faith in the
accomplishments of his ancestors, that he believed Adam
understood all sciences but politics.  But as these great
champions for our forefathers are dead, and Boileau not alive
to hitch me into a verse with Perrault, I am determined to
admire the learning of posterity, especially being convinced
that half our present knowledge sprung from discovering the
errors of what had formerly been called so.  I don't think I
shall ever make any great discoveries myself, and therefore
shall be content to propose them to my descendants, like my
Lord Bacon, who, as Dr. Shaw says very prettily in his preface
to Boyle, , had the art of inventing arts:" or rather like a
Marquis of Worcester, of whom I have seen a little book which
he calls A Century of Inventions where he has set down a
hundred machines to do impossibilities with, and not a single
direction how to make the machines themselves.(1463)

If I happen to be less punctual in my correspondence than I
intend to be, you must conclude I am writing my book, which
being designed for a panegyric, will cost me a great deal of
trouble.  The dedication, with your leave, shall be addressed
to your son that is coming, or, with my Lady Ailesbury's
leave, to your ninth son, who Will be unborn nearer to the
time I 'am writing of; always provided that she does not bring
three at once, like my Lady Berkeley.

Well! I have here set you the example of' writing nonsense
when one has nothing to say, and shall take it ill if you
don't keep up the correspondence on the same foot.  Adieu!

(1461) General Honeywood, governor of Portsmouth.

(1462) Pineda was a Spanish Jesuit, and a professor of
theology.  He died in 1637, after writing voluminous
commentaries upon several books of the Holy Scriptures,
besides an universal history of the church.

(1463) Walpole, in his "Royal and Noble Authors," designates
the Marquis as a "fantastic protector and fanatic," and
describes the " Century of Inventions" as "an amazing piece of
folly;" and Hume, who does not even know the title of the
book, boldly pronounces it "a ridiculous compound of lies,
chimeras, and impossibilities." In 18@5, however, an edition
of this curious and very amusing little work was published],
with historical and explanatory notes, by Mr. C. F.
Partington; who clearly proves, that the Marquis was the
person, either in this or any Other country, who gave the
first idea of the steam engine.-E.



563 Letter 260
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Saturday night, Sept, 3, 1748.

All my sins to Mrs. Talbot you are to expiate; I am here quite
alone, and want nothing but your fetching to go to her.  I
have been in town for a day, just to see Lord Bury who is come
over with the Duke; they return next Thursday.  The Duke is
fatter, and it is now not denied that he has entirely lost the
sight of one eye.  This did not surprise me so much as a bon
mot of his.  Gumley, who you know is grown Methodist, came to
tell him, that as he was on duty, a tree in Hyde Park, near
the powder magazine, had been set on fire; the Duke replied,
he hoped it was not by the new light.  This nonsensical new
light is extremely in fashion, and I shall not be surprised if
we see a revival of all the folly and cant of the last age.
Whitfield preaches continually at my Lady Huntingdon's,(1464)
at Chelsea; my Lord Chesterfield, my Lord Bath, my Lady
Townshend, my Lady Thanet, and others, have been to hear
him.(1465)  What will you lay that, next winter, he is not run
after, instead of Garrick?

I am just come from the play at Richmond, where I found the
Duchess of Argyle and Lady Betty Campbell, and their court.
We had a new actress, a Miss Clough; an extremely fine tall
figure, and very handsome: she spoke very justly, and with
spirit.  Garrick is to produce her next winter; and a Miss
Charlotte Ramsey, a poetess and deplorable actress.  Garrick,
Barry, and some more of the players, were there to see these
new comedians; it is to be their seminary.

Since I came home I have been disturbed with a strange,
foolish woman, that lives at the great corner house yonder;
she is an attorney's wife, and much given to the bottle.  By
the time she- has finished that and daylight, she grows afraid
of thieves, and makes the servants fire minute guns out of the
garret windows.  I remember persuading Mrs. Kerwood that there
was a great smell of thieves, and this drunken dame seems
literally to smell it.  The divine Asheton, whom I suppose you
will have seen when you receive this, will give you an account
of the astonishment we were in last night at hearing guns; I
began to think that the Duke had brought some of his defeats
from Flanders.

I am going to tell you a long story, but you will please to
remember that I don't intend to tell it well; therefore, if
you discover any beauties in the relation where I never
intended them, don't conclude, as you did in your last, that I
know they are there.  If I had not a great command of my pen,
and could not force it to write whatever nonsense I had heard
last, you would be enough to pervert all one's letters, and
put one upon keeping up one's character; but as I write merely
to satisfy you, I shall take no care but not to write well: I
hate letters that are called good letters.

You must know then,-but did you not know a young fellow that
was called Handsome Tracy?  he was walking in the Park with
some of his acquaintance, and overtook three girls; one was
very pretty: they followed them; but the girls ran away, and
the company grew tired of pursuing them, all but Tracy. (There
are now three more guns gone off; she must be very drunk.) He
followed to Whitehall gate, where he gave a porter a crown to
dog them: the porter hunted them-he the porter.  The girls ran
all round Westminster, and back to the Haymarket, where the
porter came up with them.  He told the pretty one she must go
with him, and kept her talking till Tracy arrived, quite out
of breath, and exceedingly in love.  He insisted on knowing
where she lived, which she refused to tell him; and after much
disputing , went to the house of one of her companions, and
Tracy with them.  He there made her discover her family, a
butterwoman in Craven Street, and engaged her to meet him the
next morning in the Park; but before night he wrote her four
love-letters, and in the last offered two hundred pounds
a-year to her, and a hundred a-year to Signora la Madre.
Griselda made a confidence to a staymaker's wife, who told her
that the swain was certainly in love enough to marry her, if
she could determine to be virtuous and refuse his offers.
"Ay," says she, "but if I should, and should lose him by it."
However, the measures of the cabinet council were decided for
virtue: and when she met Tracy the next morning in the park,
she was convoyed by her sister and brother-in-law, and stuck
close to the letter of her reputation.  She would do nothing
she would go nowhere.  At last, as an instance of prodigious
compliance, she told him, that if he would accept such a
dinner as a butterwoman's daughter could give him, he should
be welcome.  Away they walked to Craven Street: the mother
borrowed some silver to buy a leg of mutton, and they kept the
eager lover drinking till twelve at night, when a chosen
committee waited on the faithful pair to the minister of
May-fair.  The doctor was in bed, and swore he would not get
up to marry the King, but that he had a brother over the way
who perhaps would, and who did.  The mother borrowed a pair of
sheets, and they consummated at her house; and the next day
they went to their own palace.  In two or three days the scene
grew gloomy; and the husband coming home one night, swore he
could bear it no longer.  "Bear! bear what?"--"Why, to be
teased by all my acquaintance for marrying a butterwoman's
daughter.  I am determined to go to France, and will leave you
a handsome allowance."--"Leave me! why you don't fancy you
shall leave me? I will go with you."--"What, you love me
then?"--"No matter whether I love you or not, but you shan't
go without me."  And they are gone! If you know any body that
proposes marrying and travelling, I think they cannot do it in
a more commodious method.

I agree with you most absolutely in your opinion about Gray;
he is the worst company in the world.  From a melancholy turn.
living reclusely, and from a little too much dignity, he never
converses easily all his words are measured and chosen, and
formed into sentences his writings are admirable; he himself
is not agreeable.'(1466)

There are still two months to London; if you could discover
your own mind for any three or four days of that space, I will
either go with you to the Tigers or be glad to see you here;
but I positively will ask you neither one nor t'other any
more.  I have raised seven-and-twenty bantams from the
patriarchs you sent me.  Adieu!

(1464) Daughter of Washington, Earl Ferrers.


(1465) Lord Bolingbroke, in a letter to the Earl of Marchmont
of the 1st of November, says,
"I hope you heard from me by myself, as well of me by Mr.
Whitfield.  This apostolical person preached some time ago at
Lady Huntingdon's, and I should have been curious to hear him.
Nothing kept me from going, but an imagination that there was
to be a select auditory.  That saint, our friend Chesterfield,
was there; and I hear from him an extreme good account of the
sermon." Marchmont Papers, vol. ii. p. 377.-E.

(1466) Dr. Beattie says, in a letter to Sir W. Forbes, "Gray's
letters very much resemble what his conversation was: he had
none of the airs of either a scholar or a poet; and though on
those and all other subjects he spoke to me with the utmost
freedom, and without any reserve, he was in general company
much more silent than one could have wished."-E.



 565 Letter 261
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 18, 1748.

I have two letters of yours to account for, and nothing to
plead but my old insolvency.  Oh! yes, I have to scold you,
which you find is an inexhaustible fund with me.  You sent me
your d`em`el`e(1467) with the whole city of Florence, and
charged me to keep it secret-and the first person I saw was my
Lord Hobart, who was full of the account he had received from
you.  You might as well have told a woman an improper secret,
and expected to have it kept! but you may be very easy, for
unless it reaches my Lady Pomfret or my Lady Orford, I dare
say it will never get back to Florence; and for those two
ladies, I don't think it likely that they should hear it, for
the first is in a manner retired from the world, and the world
is retired from the second.  Now I have vented my anger, I am
seriously sorry for you, to be exposed to the impertinence of
those silly Florentine women: they deserve a worse term than
silly, since they pretend to any characters.  How could you
act with so much temper? If they had treated me in this
manner, I should have avowed ten times more than they
pretended you had done; but you are an absolute minister!

I am much obliged to Prince Beauvau for remembering me, and
should be extremely pleased to show him all manner of
attentions here: you know I profess great attachment to that
family for their civilities to me.  But how gracious the
Princess has been to you!  I am quite jealous of her dining
with you: I remember what a rout there was to get her for half
of half a quarter of an hour to your assembly.

The Bishop of London is dead; having luckily for his family,
as it proves, refused the archbishopric.*1468)  We owe him the
justice to say, that though he had broke with my father, he
always expressed himself most handsomely about him, and
without any resentment or ingratitude.

Your brothers are coming to dine with me; your brother Gal. is
extremely a favourite with me: I took to him for his
resemblance to you, but am grown to love him upon his own
fund.

The peace is still in a cloud: according to custom, we have
hurried on our complaisance before our new friends were at all
ready with theirs.  There was a great Regency(1469) kept in
town, to take off the prohibition of commerce with Spain: when
they were met, somebody asked if Spain was ready to take off
theirs?  "Oh, Lord! we never thought of that!"  They sent for
Wall,(1470) and asked him if his court would take the same
step with us?  He said, "he believed they might, but he had no
orders about it."  However, we proceeded, and hitherto are
bit.

Adieu! by the first opportunity I shelf send you the two books
of Houghton, for yourself and Dr. Cocchi.  My Lord Orford is
much mended: my uncle has no prospect of ever removing from
his couch.

(1467) A Madame Ubaldini having raised a scandalous story of
two persons whom she saw together in Mr. Mann's garden at one
of his assemblies, and a scurrilous sonnet having been made
upon the occasion, the Florentine ladies for some time
pretended that it would hurt their characters to come any more
to his assembly.

(1468) Dr. Edmund Gibson had been very intimate with Sir
Robert Walpole, and was designed by him for archbishop after
the death of Wake; but setting himself at the head of the
clergy against the Quaker bill, he broke with Sir Robert and
lost the archbishoprick which was given to Potter; but on his
death, the succeeding ministry offered it to Dr. Gibson. [The
Doctor declined it, on account of his advanced age and
increasing infirmities.  He died on the 6th of February,
1748.)

(1469) This means a meeting of the persons composing the
Regency during the King's absence in Hanover.-D.

(1470) General Wall, the Spanish ambassador.



566 Letter 262
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 25, 1748.

I shall write you a very short letter, for I don't know what
business we have to be corresponding when we might be
together.  I really wish to see you, for you know I am
convinced of what you say to me.  It is few people I ask to
come hither, and if possible, still fewer that I wish to see
here.  The disinterestedness of your friendship for me has
always appeared, and is the only sort that for the future I
will ever accept, and consequently I never expect any more
friends.  As to trying to make any by obligations, I have had
such woful success, that, for fear of thinking still worse
than I do of the world, I will never try more.  But you are
abominable to reproach me with not letting you go to Houghton:
have not I offered a thousand times to carry you there? I
mean, since it was my brother's: I did not expect to prevail
with you before; for you are so unaccountable, that you not
only will never do a dirty thing, but you won't even venture
the appearance of it.  I have often applied to you in my own
mind a very pretty passage that I remember in a letter of
Chillingworth; "you would not do that for preferment that you
would not do but for preferment." You oblige me much in what
you say about my nephews, and make me happy in the character
you have heard of Lord Malpas;(1471) I am extremely inclined
to believe he deserves it.  I am as sorry to hear what a
companion lord Walpole has got: there has been a good deal of
noise about him, but I had laughed at it, having traced the
worst reports to his gracious mother, who is now sacrificing
the character of her son to her aversion for her husband.  If
we lived under the Jewish dispensation, how I should tremble
at my brother's leaving no children by her, and its coming to
my turn to raise him up issue!

Since I gave you the account of the Duchess of Ireland's piked
horns among the tombs of the Veres, I have found a long
account in Bayle of the friar, who, as I remember to have read
somewhere, preached so vehemently against that fashion: it was
called Hennin, and the monk's name was Thomas Conecte.  He was
afterwards burnt at Rome for censuring the lives of the
clergy.  As our histories say that Anne of Bohemia introduced
the fashion here, it is probable that the French learnt it
from us, and were either long before they caught it, Or long
in retaining the mode; for the Duke of Ireland died in 1389,
and Connect was burnt at Rome in 1434.  There were, indeed,
several years between his preaching down Hennins and his
death, but probably not near five-and-forty years, and half
that term was a long duration for so outrageous a fashion.
But I have found a still more entertaining fashion in another
place in Bayle which was, the women wearing looking-glasses
upon their bellies': I don't conceive for what use.  Adieu!
don't write any more, but come.

(1471) Eldest son of George, third Earl of Cholmondoley, and
grandson of Sir Robert Walpole.



567 Letter 263
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 6, 1748.

Dear harry,
I am sorry our wishes clash so much.  Besides that I have no
natural inclination for the Parliament, it will particularly
disturb me now in the middle of all my planting; for which
reason I have never inquired when it will meet, and cannot
help you to guess--but I should think not hastily-for I
believe the peace, at least the evacuations, are not in so
prosperous a way as to be ready to make any figure in the
King's speech.  But I speak from a distance; it may all be
very toward: our ministers enjoy the consciousness of their
wisdom, as the good do of their virtue, and take no pains to
make it shine before men.  In the mean time, we have several
collateral emoluments from the pacification: all our
milliners, tailors, tavern keepers, and young gentlemen are
tiding to France for our improvement in luxury; and as I
foresee we shall be told on their return that we have lived in
a total state of blindness for these six years. and gone
absolutely retrograde to all true taste in every particular, I
have already begun to practise walking on my head, and doing
every thing the wrong way.  Then Charles Frederick has turned
all his virt`u into fireworks, and, by his influence at the
ordnance, has prepared such a spectacle for the proclamation
of the peace as is to surpass all its predecessors of bouncing
memory.  It is to open with a concert of fifteen hundred
hands, and conclude with so many hundred thousand crackers all
set to music, that all the men killed in the war are to be
wakened with the crash, as if it was the day of judgment, and
fall a dancing, like the troops in the Rehearsal.  I wish you
could see him making squibs of his papillotes, and bronzed
over with a patina of gunpowder, and talking himself still
hoarser on the superiority that his firework will have over
the Roman naumachia.

I am going to dinner with Lady Sophia Thomas(1472) at Hampton
Court, where I was to meet the Cardigans; but I this minute
receive a message that the Duchess of Montagu(1473) is
extremely ill, which I am much concerned for on Lady
Cardigan's(1474) account, whom I grow every day more in love
with; you may imagine, not her person, which is far from
improved lately; but, since I have been here, I have lived
much with them, and, as George Montagu says, in all my
practice I never met a better understanding, nor more really
estimable qualities: such a dignity in her way of thinking; so
little idea of any thing mean or ridiculous, and such proper
contempt for both! Adieu! I must go dress for dinner, and you
perceive that I wish I had, but have nothing to tell you.

(1472) Daughter of the first Earl of Albemarle, and wife of
General Thomas.-E.

(1473) She was mother to Lady Cardigan, and daughter to the
great Duke of Marlborough.

Montagu, and wife of George Brudenell, Earl of Cardigan,
afterwards created Duke of Montagu.

To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 20, 1748.

You are very formal to send me a ceremonious letter of thanks;
you see I am less punctilious, for having nothing to tell you,
I did not answer your letter.  I have been in the empty town
for a day: Mrs.
 Muscovy and I cannot devise where you have planted Jasmine; I
am all plantation, and sprout away like any chaste nymph in
the Metamorphosis.

They say the old Monarch at Hanover has got a new mistress; I
fear he ought to have got * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Now I talk of getting, Mr. Fox has got the ten thousand pound
prize; and the Violette, as it is said, Coventry for a
husband.  It is certain that at the fine masquerade he was
following her, as she was under the Countess's arm, who,
pulling off her glove, moved her wedding-ring up and down her
finger, which it seems was to signify that no other terms
would be accepted.  It is the year for contraband marriages,
though I do not find Fanny Murray's is certain.  I liked her
spirit in an instance I heard t'other night: she was
complaining of want of money; Sir Robert Atkins immediately
gave her a twenty pound note; she said, "D-n your twenty
pound! what does it signify?" clapped it between two pieces of
bread and butter, and ate it. Adieu! nothing should make me
leave off so shortly but that my gardener waits for me, and
you must allow that he is to be preferred to all the world.




569 Letter 265
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, October 24, 1748.

I have laughed heartily at your adventure of Milord Richard
Onslow;(1475) it is an admirable adventure!  I am not sure
that Riccardi's absurdity was not the best part of it.  Here
were the Rinuncinis, the Panciaticis, and Pandolfinis? were
they as ignorant too? What a brave topic it would have been
for Niccolini, if he had been returned, to display all his
knowledge of England!

Your brothers are just returned from Houghton, where they
found my brother extremely recovered: my uncle too, I hear, is
better; but I think that an impossible recovery.(1476)  Lord
Walpole is setting out on his travels; I shall be impatient to
have him in Florence; I flatter myself you will like him: I,
who am not troubled with partiality to my family, admire him
much.  Your brother has got the two books of Houghton, and
will send them by the first Opportunity: I am by no means
satisfied with then; they are full of' faults, and the two
portraits wretchedly unlike.

The peace is signed between us, France, and Holland, but does
not give the least joy; the stocks do not rise, and the
merchants are unsatisfied; they say France will sacrifice us
to Spain, which has not yet signed: in short, there has not
been the least symptom of public rejoicing; but the government
is to give a magnificent firework.

I believe there are no news, but I am here all alone,
planting.  The Parliament does not meet till the 29th of next
month: I shall go to town but two or three days before that.
The Bishop of Salisbury,(1477) who refused Canterbury, accepts
London, upon a near prospect of some fat fines.  Old Tom
Walker(1478) is dead, and has left vast wealth and good
places; but have not heard where either are to go.  Adieu!  I
am very paragraphical, and you see have nothing to say.

(1475) One Daniel Bets, a Dutchman or Fleming, who called
himself my Lord Richard Onslow, and pretended to be the
Speaker's son, having forged letters of credit Ind drawn money
from several bankers, came to Florence, and was received as an
Englishman of quality by Marquis Riccardi, who could not be
convinced by Mr. Mann of the imposture till the adventurer ran
away on foot to Rome in the night.

(1476) Yet he did in great measure recover by the use of soap
and limewater.

(1477) Dr. Sherlock.

(1478) He was surveyor of the roads; had been a kind of
toad-eater to Sir Robert Walpole and Lord Godolphin; was a
great frequenter of Newmarket, and a notorious usurer.  His
reputed wealth is stated, in the Gentleman's Magazine, at
three hundred thousand pounds.]



570 Letter 266
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec. 2, 1748.

Our King is returned and our parliament met: we expected
nothing but harmony and tranquillity, and love of the peace;
but the very first day opened with a black cloud, that
threatens a stormy session.  To the great surprise of the
ministry, the Tories appear in intimate league with the
Prince's party, and both agreed in warm and passionate
expressions on the treaty: we shall not have the discussion
till after Christmas.  My uncle, who is extremely mended by
soap, and the hopes of a peerage is come up, and the very
first day broke out in a volley of treaties: though he is
altered, you would be astonished at his spirits.

We talk much of the Chancellor's(1479) resigning the seals,
from weariness of the fatigue, and being made president of the
council, with other consequent changes, which I will write you
if they happen; but as this has already been a discourse of
six months, I don't give it you for certain.

Mr. Chute, to whom alone I communicated Niccolini's
banishment, though it is now talked of from the Duke of
Bedford's office, says "he is sorry the Abb`e is banished for
the only thing which he ever saw to commend in him,-his
abusing the Tuscan ministry." I must tell you another
admirable bon mot of Mr. Chute, now I am mentioning him.
Passing by the door of Mrs. Edwards, who died of drams, be saw
the motto which the undertakers had placed to her escutcheon,
Mors janua vitae, he said "it ought to have been Mors aqua
vita."

The burlettas are begun; I think, not decisively liked or
condemned yet: their success is certainly not rapid, though
Pertici is excessively admired.  Garrick says he is the best
comedian he ever saw: but the women are execrable, not a
pleasing note amongst them.  Lord Middlesex has stood a trial
with Monticelli for arrears of salary, in Westminster-hall,
and even let his own handwriting be proved against him! You
may imagine he was cast.  Hume Campbell, lord Marchmont's
brother, a favourite advocate, and whom the ministry have
pensioned out of the Opposition into silence, was his council,
and protested, striking his breast, that he had never set his
foot but once into an opera-house in his life.  This
affectation 'of British patriotism is excellently ridiculous
in a man so known: I have often heard my father say, that of
all the men he ever ](new, Lord Marchmont and Hume Campbell
were the most abandoned in their professions to him on their
coming into the world: he was hindered from accepting their
services by the present Duke of Argyll, of whose faction they
were not.  They then flung themselves into the Opposition,
where they both have made great figures, till the elder was
shut out of Parliament by his father's death, and the younger
being very foolishly dismissed from being solicitor to the
Prince, in favour of Mr. Bathurst, accepted a pension from the
court, and seldom comes into the House, and has lately taken
to live on roots and study astronomy.(1480)  Lord Marchmont,
you know, was one of Pope's heroes, had a place in Scotland on
Lord Chesterfield's coming into the ministry, though he had
not power to bring him into the sixteen: and was very near
losing his place last winter, on being Supposed the author of
the famous apology for Lord Chesterfield's resignation.  This
is the history of these Scotch brothers, which I have told you
for want of news.

Two Oxford scholars are condemned to two years' imprisonment
for treason;(1481) and their vice-chancellor, for winking at
it, is soon to be tried.  What do you say to the young
Pretender's persisting to stay in France? It will not be easy
to persuade me that it is without the approbation of that
court.  Adieu!

(1479) Lord Hardwicke.-D.

(1480) In the preceding March, Lord Marchmont had married a
second wife.@, Miss Crampton.  The circumstances attending
this marriage are thus related by David Hume, in a letter to
Mr. Oswald, dated January 29, 1748:-" Lord Marchmont has had
the most extraordinary adventure in the world.  About three
weeks ago he was at the play, when he espied in one of the
boxes a fair virgin, whose looks, airs, and manners had such a
wonderful effect upon him, as was visible by every bystander.
His raptures were so undisguised, his looks so expressive of
passion, his inquiries so earnest, that every person took
notice of it.  He soon was told that her name was Crampton, a
linendraper's daughter, who had been bankrupt last year.  He
wrote next morning to her father, desiring to visit his
daughter on honourable terms, and in a few days she will be
the Countess of Marchmont.  Could you ever suspect the
ambitious, the severe, the bustling, the impetuous, the
violent Marchmont of becoming so tender and gentle a swain-an
Orondates!"-E.

(1481) In drinking the Pretender's health, and using seditious
expressions against the King.  They were also sentenced "to
walk round Westminster-hall with a label affixed to Their
foreheads, denoting their crime and sentence, and to ask
pardon of the several courts;" which they accordingly
performed.-E.



571 Letter 267
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec. 15, 1748.

I conclude your Italy talks of nothing but the young
Pretender's imprisonment at Vincennes. I don't know whether he
be a Stuart, but I am sure, by his extravagance he has proved
himself' of English extraction! What a mercy that we had not
him here! with a temper so, impetuous and obstinate, as to
provoke a French government when in their power, what would he
have done with an English Government in his power?(1482)  An
account came yesterday that he, with his Sheridan and a Mr.
Stafford (who was a creature of my Lord Bath,) are transmitted
to Pont de Beauvoisin, under a solemn promise never to return
into France (I suppose unless they send for him).  It is said
that a Mr. Dun, who married Alderman Parsons's eldest
daughter, is in the Bastile for having struck the officer when
the young man was arrested.

Old Somerset(1483) is at last dead, and the Duke of Newcastle
Chancellor of Bainbridge, to his heart's content.  Somerset
tendered his pride even beyond his hate; for he has left the
present Duke all the furniture of his palaces, and forbore to
charge the estate, according to a power he had, with
five-and-thirty thousand pounds.  To his Duchess,(1484) who
has endured such a long slavery with him, he has left nothing
but one thousand pounds and a small farm, besides her
jointure; giving the whole of his unsettled estate, which is
about six thousand pounds a-year, equally between his two
daughters, and leaving it absolutely in their own powers now,
though neither are of age; and to Lady Frances, the eldest, he
has additionally given the fine house built by Inigo Jones, in
Lincoln's-inn-fields, (which he had bought of the Duke of
Ancaster for the Duchess,) hoping that his daughter will let
her mother live with her.  To Sir Thomas Bootle he has given
half a borough, and a whole one,(1485) to his grandson Sir
Charles Windham,(1486) with an estate that cost him fourteen
thousand pounds.  To Mr. Obrien,(1487) Sir Charles Windham's
brother, a single thousand; and to Miss Windham an hundred
a-year, which he gave her annually at Christmas, and is just
Such a legacy as you would give to a housekeeper to prevent
her from going to service again.  She is to be married
immediately to the second Grenville;(1488) they have waited
for a larger legacy.  The famous settlement(1489) is found,
which gives Sir Charles Windham about twelve thousand pounds
a-year of the Percy estate after the present Duke's death; the
other five, with the barony of Percy, must go to Lady Betty
Smithson.(1490)  I don't know whether you ever heard that, in
Lord Grenville's administration, he had prevailed with the
King to grant the earldom of Northumberland to Sir Charles;
Lord Hertford represented against it; at last the King said he
would give it to whoever they would make it appear was to have
the Percy estate; but old Somerset refused to let any body see
his writings, and so the affair dropped, every body believing
that there was no such settlement.

John Stanhope of the admiralty is dead, and Lord Chesterfield
gets thirty thousand pounds for life: I hear Mr. Villiers is
most likely to succeed to that board.  You know all the
Stanhopes are a family aux bon-mots: I must tell you one of
this John.  He was sitting by an old Mr. Curzon, a nasty
wretch, and very covetous: his nose wanted blowing, and
continued to want it: at last Mr. Stanhope, with the greatest
good-breeding, said, "Indeed, Sir, if you don't wipe your
nose, you will lose that drop."

I am extremely pleased with Monsieur de Mirepoix's(1491) being
named for this embassy; and I beg you will desire Princess
Craon to recommend me to Madame, for I would be particularly
acquainted with her as she is their daughter.  Hogarth has run
a great risk since the peace; he went to France, and was so
imprudent as to be taking a sketch of the drawbridge at
Calais.  He was seized and carried to the governor, where he
was forced to prove his vocation by producing several
caricatures of the French; particularly a scene(1492) of the
shore, with an immense piece of beef landing for the
lion-d'argent, the English inn at Calais, and several hungry
friars following it.(1493)  They were much diverted with his
drawings, and dismissed him.

Mr. Chute lives at the herald's office in your service, and
yesterday got particularly acquainted with your
great-great-grandmother.  I says, by her character, she would
be extremely shocked at your wet-brown-paperness, and that she
was particularly famous for breaking her own pads.  Adieu!

(1482) At the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle the French court
proposed to establish Prince Charles at Fribourg in
Switzerland, with the title of Prince of Wales, a company of
guards, and a sufficient pension; but he placed a romantic
point of Honour in 'braving 'the orders from Hanover,' as he
called them, and positively refused to depart from Paris.
Threats, entreaties, arguments, were tried on him in vain.  He
withstood even a letter obtained from his father at Rome, and
commanding his departure.  He still nourished some secret
expectation, that King Louis would not venture to use force
against a kinsman; but he found himself deceived.  As he went
to the Opera on the evening of the 11th of December, his coach
was stopped by a party of French guards, himself seized, bound
hand and foot, and conveyed, with a single attendant, to the
state-prison of Vincennes, where he was thrust into a dungeon
seven feet wide and eight feet long.  After this public
insult, he was carried to Pont de Beauvoisin, on the frontier
of Savoy, and there restored to his wandering and desolate
freedom." lord Mahon, vol .iii. p. 552.-E.

574 Letter 268
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Dec. 26, 1748.

Did you ever know a more absolute country-gentleman?  Here am
I come down to what you call keep my Christmas! indeed it is
not in all the forms; I have stuck no laurel and holly in my
windows, I eat no turkey and chine, I have no tenants to
invite, I have not brought a single soul With me.  The weather
is excessively stormy, but has been so warm, and so entirely
free from frost the whole winter, that not only several of' my
honeysuckles are come out, but I have literally a blossom upon
a nectarine-tree, which I believe was never seen in this
climate before on the 26th of December.  I am extremely busy
here planting; I have got four more acres, which makes my
territory prodigious in a situation where land is so scarce,
and villas as abundant as formerly at Tivoli and Baiae.  I
have now about fourteen acres, and am making a terrace the
whole breadth of my garden on the brow of a natural hill, With
meadows at the foot, and commanding the river, the village,
Richmond-hill, and the park, and part of Kingston-but I hope
never to show it you.  What you hint at in your last, increase
of character, I should be extremely against your stirring in
now: the whole system of embassies is in confusion, and more
candidates than employments.  I would have yours pass, as it
is, for settled.  If you were to be talked especially for a
higher character at Florence, one don't know whom the
-,additional dignity might tempt.  Hereafter, perhaps, it
might be practicable for you, but I would by no means advise
your soliciting it at present.  Sir Charles Williams is the
great obstacle to all arrangement: Mr. Fox makes a point of
his going to Turin; the ministry, Who do not love him, are not
for his going any where.  Mr. Villiers is talked of for
Vienna, though just made a lord of the admiralty.  There were
so many competitors, that at last Mr. Pelham said he would
carry in two names to the King, and he should choose (a great
indulgence!) Sir Peter Warren and Villiers were carried in;
the King chose the latter.  I believe there is a little of
Lord Granville in this, and in a Mr. Hooper, who was turned
out with the last ministry, and is now made a commissioner of
the customs: the pretence is, to vacate a seat in Parliament
for Sir Thomas Robinson, who is made a lord of trade; a scurvy
reward after making the peace.  Mr. Villiers, you know, has
been much gazetted, and had his letters to the King of Prussia
printed; but he is a very silly fellow.  I met him the other
day at Lord Granville's, where, on the subject of a new play,
he began to give the Earl an account of CoriolanUS, with
reflections on his history.  Lord Granville at last grew
impatient, and said, "Well! well! it is an old story; it may
not be true." As we went out together, I said, "I like the
approach to this house."'(1494)  "Yes,"said Villiers, "and I
love to be in it; for I never come here but I hear something I
did not know before." Last year, I asked him to attend a
controverted election in which I was interested; he told me he
would with all his heart, but that he had resolved not to vote
in elections for the first session, for that he owned he could
not understand them--not understand them!

Lord St. John(1495) is dead; he had a place in the
custom-house of 1200 pounds a year, which his father had
bought of the Duchess of Kendal for two lives, for 4000
pounds.  Mr. Pelham has got it for Lord Lincoln and his child.

I told you in my last a great deal about old Somerset's will:
they have since found 150,000 which goes, too, between the two
daughters.  It had been feared that he would leave nothing to
the youngest; two or three years ago, he waked after dinner
and found himself upon the floor; she used to watch him, had
left him, and he had fallen from his couch.  He forbade every
body to speak to her, but yet to treat her with respect as his
daughter.  She went about the house for a year, without any
body daring openly to utter a syllable to her; and it was
never known that he had forgiven her.  His whole stupid life
was a series of pride and tyranny.

There have been great contests in the Privy Council about the
trial of the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford: the Duke of' Bedford
and Lord Gower pressed it extremely.  The latter asked the
Attorney-General(1496) his opinion, who told him the evidence
did not appear strong enough: Lord Gower said, "Mr. Attorney,
you Seem to be very lukewarm for your party." He replied, "My
lord, I never was lukewarm for my party, nor ever was but Of
one party." There is a scheme for vesting in the King the
nomination of' the Chancellor of that University,(1497) who
has much power--and much noise it would make! The Lord
Chancellor is to be High Steward of Cambridge, in succession
to the Duke of Newcastle.

The families of Devonshire and Chesterfield have received a
great blow at Derby, where, on the death of John Stanhope,
they set up another of the name.  One Mr. Rivett, the Duke's
chief friend and manager. stood himself, and carried it by a
majority of seventy-one.  Lord Chesterfield had sent down
credit for ten thousand pounds.  The Cavendish's. however, are
very happy, for Lady Hartington(1498) has produced a
son.(1499)

I asked a very intelligent person if there could be any
foundation for the story of Niccolini's banishment taking its
rise from complaints of our court: he answered very sensibly,
that even if our court had complained, -which was most
unlikely, it was not at all probable that the court of Vienna
would have paid any regard to it.  There is another paragraph
in your same letter in which I must set you right: you talk Of
the sudden change of my opinion about Lord Walpole:(1500) I
never had but one opinion about him, and that was always most
favourable: nor can I imagine what occasioned your mistake,
unless my calling him a wild boy, where I talked of the
consequences of his father's death.  I meant nothing in the
world by wild, but the thoughtlessness of a boy of nineteen,
who comes to the possession of a peerage and an estate.  My
partiality, I am sure, could never let me say any thing else
of him.

Mr. Chute's sister is dead.  When I came from town Mr. Whithed
had heard nothing of her will - she had about four thousand
pounds.  The brother is so capricious a monster, that we
almost hope she has not given the whole to our friend.

You will be diverted with a story I am going to tell You; it
is very long, and so is my letter already; but you perceive I
am in the country and have nothing to hurry me.  There is
about town a Sir William Burdett,*1501) a man of a very good
family, but most infamous character.  He formerly was at Paris
with a Mrs. Penn, a Quaker's wife, whom he there bequeathed to
the public, and was afterwards a sharper at Brussels, and
lately came to England to discover a plot for poisoning the
Prince of Orange, in which I believe he was poisoner, poison,
and informer all himself.  In short, to give you his character
at once, there is a wager entered in the bet-book at White's
(a MS. of which I may one day or other give you an account),
that the first baronet that will be hanged is this Sir William
Burdett.  About two months ago he met at St. James's, a Lord
Castledurrow,(1502) a young Irishman, and no genius as you
will find, and entered into conversation with him: the Lord,
seeing a gentleman, fine, polite, and acquainted with every
body, invited him to dinner for next day, and a Captain
Rodney,(1503) a young seaman, who has made a fortune by very
gallant behaviour during the war.  At dinner it came out, that
neither the Lord nor the Captain had ever been at any
Pelham-levees.  "Good God!" said Sir William, "that must not
be so any longer; I beg I may carry you to both the Duke and
Mr. Pelham: I flatter myself I am very well with both." The
appointment was made for the next Wednesday and Friday; in the
mean time, he invited the two young men to dine with him the
next day.  When they came, he presented them to a lady,
dressed foreign, as a princess of the house of' Brandenburg:
she had a toadeater, and there was another man, who gave
himself for a count.  After dinner Sir William looked at his
watch, and said, "J-s! it is not so late as I thought by an
hour; Princess, will your Highness say how we shall divert
ourselves till it is time to go to the play!"  "Oh!" said she,
"for my part you know I abominate every thing but pharaoh." "I
am very sorry, Madam," replied he, very gravely, "but I don't
know whom your Highness will get to tally to you; you know I
am ruined by dealing'."  "Oh!" says she, "the Count will deal
to us."  "I would with all my soul." said the Count, "but I
protest I have no money about me."  She insisted: at last the
Count said, "Since your Highness commands us peremptorily, I
believe Sir William has four or five hundred pounds of mine,
that I am to pay away in the city to-morrow: if he will be so
good as to step to his bureau for that Sum, I will make a bank
of it." Mr. Rodney owns he was a little astonished at seeing
the Count shuffle with the faces of the cards upwards; but
concluding that Sir 'William Burdett, at whose house he was,
was a relation or particular friend of Lord Castledurrow, he
was unwilling to affront my lord.  In short, my lord and he
lost about a hundred and fifty apiece, and it was settled that
they should meet for payment the next morning at breakfast at
Ranelagh, In the mean time Lord C. had the curiosity to
inquire a little int the character of his new friend the
Baronet; and being au fait, he went up to him at Ranelagh and
apostrophized him; "Sir William, here is the sum I think I
lost last night; since that I have heard that you are a
professed pickpocket, and therefore desire to have no further
acquaintance with you." Sir William bowed, took the money and
no notice; but as they were going away, he followed Lord
Castledurrow and said, "Good God, my lord, my equipage is not
come; will you be so good as to set me down at
Buckingham-gate?" and without staying for an answer, whipped
into the chariot and came to town with him.  If you don't
admire the coolness of this impudence, I shall wonder.  Adieu!
I have written till I can scarce write my name.(1504)

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/eBook03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/eBook03

Or /eBook02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the

     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          eBook in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
