Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we do NOT keep these books
in compliance with any particular paper edition, usually otherwise.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1997 for a total of 1000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 100 billion Etexts given away.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

The author of this little book spent several years in composing his
work, to the best of his ability, making the treatise brief and to the
point, so that the reader may not become weary and misunderstand the
true meaning.

His desire is to have the flourishing human know the truth of Science
and to learn what he can of its greatest wonders.

ABC's OF SCIENCE


CHAPTER I
THE SUPREME POWER OF NATURE

1.
Supreme power of Nature is comprised of all.

2.
It may be divided into three parts:  Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal.

3.
Mineral is comprised of Mineral Matter and Mineral Magnetism.

4.
Animal is comprised of Animal Matter and Animal Magnetism.

5.
Vegetable is comprised of Vegetable Matter and Vegetable Magnetism.

6.
Each of the foregoing have life, and by cooperating with each other
produce life that flourishes.

7.
There being as many different kinds of Magnetism as there are matter
which is beyond the strength of human to classify.

8.
The supreme power of Nature had no beginning so it has no end; its
life is indestructible.

returned at intervals of 6 1/2 years.  In 1846 it returned split,
returned in 1852, but never appeared since."  "Saturn."]


CHAPTER II
ASTRONOMY

(The word "vapor" used in general for water, ice, atmosphere, etc.)

1.
Space without beginning or end, filled with unmaterial and material
life.  The material is in motion by the currents of unmaterial life.

2.
The material is in perfect bodies, imperfect bodies, and
unconcentrated material.

3.
Perfect bodies group into constellation, called sun's planets,
planetoids, and moons.

4.
Imperfect bodies are comets, called periodic and parabolic comets.

5.
Unconcentrated material called Milky Ways, and rings such as are
around Saturn.

6.
The unmaterial life currents run in every conceivable manner.  I will
call the currents carrying constellation sun currents, planet
currents, planetoid currents, moon currents, and comet currents,
respectively.

Milky ways eddys.

7.
Saturn is the only body we know which has an unconcentrated obsequious
attendant. Such rings may appear around constellations, planets,
moons, etc.

These rings can be accounted for in two ways,--first, the material
never being concentrated; second, by two or more bodies coming
together and throwing the bodies into atoms.

8.
Suck, or Nebula, currents form in the Milky ways (the same as two or
more currents of air coming together and making a whirlwind), which
concentrates the material into bodies, thus forming constellations and
comets; also rings such as are around Saturn.

If a constellation is formed its current is called sun current, and
here it continues to whirl with all its subordinate currents, planet,
planetoid, and moon.

9.
Comets are caused by sun currents' pressure forcing the suck currents
at a great speed, and forces the comet current to pass through sun
currents.  Some comets pass in and out of their sun currents at
regular intervals and are called periodic, i.e., its orbit is an
ellipse.

Comets that are parabolic will never return to their starting point
and travel wild.

10.

Bodies may be destroyed by suck currents carrying bodies in collision
with each other; if the bodies are equal size, will throw the material
into atoms.  If a small and large body come in collision the small
body will bury itself in the greater.  Bodies thrown into atoms, the
atoms may continue to be carried by its respective current (as rings
around Saturn), or the atoms may be forced beyond its current and pass
as shooting stars to other bodies or milky ways.

11.
Nebula is the suck current in the process of condensing material into
bodies.  Can be seen in Milky Way with naked eve.

system."  "The sun."]


CHAPTER III
THE SOLAR SYSTEM

1.
The Solar System is better known to us, as the earth on which we
flourish belongs to it.

2.
The System is comprised of one sun (star), eight major planets,
Mercury, Venus, Earth, and one satellite, Mars and two satellites,
Jupiter and seven satellites, Saturn, its rings and ten satellites,
Uranus and four satellites, Neptune and one satellite, and some 600
planetoids, varying in size from 600 miles in diameter to mere rocks.

3.
The sun's diameter is 866,000 miles.  Rotates every 606 hours.  The
length of time its current carries the sun over its orbit is unknown.
The sun remains a melted mass; its vibration is maintained; has but
little vapor and its theme reflected on the surface of its obsequious
attendants which gives them heat and light.

Dark spots caused by vapor becoming concentrated to the sun's surface;
these spots change.

4.
Mercury, the smallest major planet, also the closest to the sun.  It
is carried over its orbit about 36,000,000 miles from the sun, which
requires 88 days to complete its course, and rotates once every 24
hours and 5 minutes.  Its diameter is 3,000 miles and it has a
suitable amount of vapor for animals and vegetables to flourish.

5.
Venus has the brightest lustre of our planets which is caused from
enormous amount of vapor.  It is carried over its orbit at about
67,000,000 miles from the sun, which requires 224 7/10 days to
complete its course.  Rotates once every 23 hours and 21 minutes.
Diameter, 7,700 miles.

6.
The earth is carried over its orbit; main distance being 93,000,000
miles from the sun, which requires one year to complete its course,
which is 680,000,000 miles:

                                   MILES
     Earth's diameter              8,000
     Greater or equatorial         7,925
     Less or polar                 7,899
         Difference on comparison     26

The earth rotates once every 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds; has
one satellite, which is carried over its orbit at a distance of
238,850 miles from the earth.  Its diameter is 2,160 miles.  The moon
completes its orbit in 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 2 seconds.
Its currents touch the earth and cause the tide; also affects some
plants of the phenomena verita; these plants are also affected by the
sun.

Many years after the earth's material began to flourish, a small body
(whose crust was cooled) came in contact with the earth; this caused
the earth's crust to crack almost from pole to pole and formed North
and South America.  The eruptions in Europe, Asia, and Africa were
greatly scattered.  Australian soil is deficient in phosphorus, which
shows it is foreign and represents the small body which did not
entirely bury itself.  This caused some of the earth's land surface to
be below the sea level; also caused the earth's axis to change at a
very slow rate of about 77 yards per year.  This will require many
thousands of years for the North Pole to become the South Pole.  For
many years the Polar star appeared "fixed" at the earth's north axis.

7.
Mars is carried around the sun by its planet current at a distance of
140,000,000 miles, which requires 687 days, and rotates every 24
hours, 37 minutes, and 22 1/2 seconds.  Diameter, 4,200 miles.  Mars
has two satellites and is not abundant in vapor which causes its
reddish appearance, therefore vegetation and animals are scanty.

8.
Jupiter is the largest major planet.  It makes a great jump from the
sun of 483,000,000 miles, carried by its planet current to complete
its orbit in 12 years.  Rotates every 9 hours, 55 minutes, and 37
seconds.  Diameter, 88,000 miles; has seven satellites.  The climate
has a very even temperature due to its fast rotation.

9.
Saturn, the beauty of the skies, carried by its planet current around
the sun at its main distance of 883,000,000 miles (a greater distance
of 400,000,000 miles than Jupiter) which requires about 29 1/2 years.
Rotates once every 10 hours, 14 minutes, and 23 seconds.  Diameter,
75,000 miles.  It has ten satellites and three rings of unconcentrated
material.  The cape ring is about 9,000 miles across, the other two
about 16,000 each.  Diameter of rings about 170,000 miles, which makes
the rings very close to the surface.

10.
Uranus is carried by its planet current around the sun at a great
distance of 1,778,000,000 miles, which requires about 84 years.  Rate
of rotation unknown.  Diameter, 31,000 miles.  It has four satellites.

11.
Neptune is the farthest from the sun.  Its main distance being
2,792,000,000 miles; carried by its planet current over its orbit once
in 164 years, 9 months.  Diameter, 37,000 miles.  Period of rotation
unknown.  Has one satellite.  At Neptune we haven't taken a step but
our next neighbor is across the divide.  Let us have a fairy dream and
travel from the sun to Neptune in a straight or direct course at the
rate of 1,000,000 miles an hour; it would take us 116 1/3 days to
reach Neptune.


[Figure:  Line drawing, captioned "The solar system."]


CHAPTER IV
ACROSS THE DIVIDE

1.
Crossing the divide (Abyss) we encounter other systems of about
25,000,000,000, or the first magnitude.  Our most powerful glass
reaches the 16th.

Magnitude is very uneven and irregular, and beyond this there is no
end.

2.
Many constellations have more than one sun, while others are double,
quadruple, and multiple.  It is estimated a brilliant star, and can be
seen; of these over a million have been catalogued and only about 25
whose distance have been measured.


CHAPTER V
FLOURISHMENT OF THE EARTH

1.
The earth reached its state of concentration, and the vapor in great
clouds enveloped the heavier substance.  The earth being heaved up by
volcanoes (caused by the vapor coming in contact with the heated
material); as the vapor reached its state, rain fell on the earth
crust, and thus rivers, lakes, and oceans were formed.

2.
Here animal and vegetable matter began to flourish.

3.
Great deposits of protoplasm became concentrated over the earth's
surface; from the deposits sprang all kinds of vegetables and animals
that flourish, and many more families than inhabit the earth to-day
became extinct.

4.
Vegetable matter began to flourish as its semen became concentrated,
likewise animal matter.  (This takes place to-day in different ways,
principally in Marine varites.  See Chap. I, par. 6.)

5.
Reproductions in all families that flourish; some families mix and
their offspring will not reproduce.  (Life cannot be destroyed, but
flourishment can.)

6.
Man came from deposits of protoplasm (semen) as is produced for
reproduction of man to-day.  The deposits were of different kinds;
each deposit brought forth its own branch of humanity, these branches
being of different type and tongue.  Later the tongue of one branch
became learned by the other.  From the different original tongues will
give us a good estimate of deposits in number.

7.
Babies were nourished in the protoplasm deposits the same as they are
in their mother's womb.  This nourishment came from the abundance of
albumen which accompanied the semen in concentrating.  As the babies
matured they broke the crust of the deposit of protoplasm and put
forth their heads and breathed the air; their bodies still remained in
the albumen until they gained strength to feed themselves on the
albumen.  Here the babies broke the cord (navel cord) that brought
nourishment into their bodies, as in the womb of a mother, and crawled
around over the crust of the deposit where they came, feeding on its
crust by putting it into their mouths. The babe has not forgotten it
yet, as everything he gets that he can handle goes to his mouth.  He
learned to walk and talk to his brothers and sisters, and composed a
language of their own.  Here manhood and womanhood is reached.

8.
All animals came in like manner, but without a fluent language.

9.

Vegetable matter flourished and the earth is inhabited. All bodies
that have atmosphere are inhabited.  Atmosphere is vaporized
protoplasm.

10.
Ten of the principal materials that produce flourishment are carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, sulphur, calcium,
iron and magnesium; protoplasm contains everything; chemists have not
been able to determine and classify protoplasm.  (See Chap. I, par.
7.)

11.
Humanity varied much in size.  The giant tribe (such as the petrified
Cardiff Giant) has long been extinct.  Men of this type weighed 500
pounds and more, measured nearly 12 feet in height, while our midgets
measure under 2 feet.

12.
Hermaphrodites exist in all material that flourishes.  Malformation.


CHAPTER VI
ANIMAL MAGNETISM

1.
Every animal has its own magnetism which is its source of strength and
intelligence.  The glands, nerves, and ducts are batteries, ducts and
glands storage batteries, the nerves motive and sensation (or
intelligence).  The brain is the principal battery of sensation (or
intelligence), while the heart is the principal motive battery.

2.
The child begins to train himself to make use of his limbs, first by
swinging his arms and legs, second by creeping, third by walking.
Note a child feeding itself, how unsteady he is in getting his food to
his mouth; sometimes his spoon misses his mouth and the food is
spilled, for which he usually receives a slap, although he has
displayed all his energy in getting his food in his mouth.  Next we
find him a trained athlete and skilled laborer, capable of applying
himself to most anything he cares to do.

3.
But little attention is paid to the training of animal magnetism.  Any
one with nerves in his teeth can concentrate magnetism in the teeth,
so it can be easily felt, also the lips; by training the magnetism it
can be concentrated in any part of the body.  This takes constant
practice and could be used when one has any disability by
concentrating the magnetism in the disabled part, causing the blood to
circulate more freely at the point where the magnetism is
concentrated, and thus improving the disabled part.  The osteologist
does this by massage, the real faith cure man by concentrating his
magnetism on the patient, the practitioner uses medicine and drugs,
each having their own magnetism, etc.  Accordingly many diseases are
contagious by people becoming inoculated by mild magnetism which comes
from some kind of matter.  (See Chap. I, par. 7.)

4.
The hypnotist or mesmerist gains control of his opponents through
animal magnetism and controls every movement.  The nerves cease to act
and the hypnotist is boss.  The patient can be made to exert great
strength and pass dangerous points without falling.  A hypnotist or
mesmerist is invariably in poor health and flesh.  This is caused by
the over-taxation of his own nerves and ducts.

6.
Animal magnetism can he used like wireless telegraphy.  Miss Helen
Kellar is one of the best known for telepathy.  She was born blind,
also deaf and dumb.  She is a great linguist and well educated.

7.
The dumb animals in their wild state use telepathy much when
encountering danger; their keen scent of the deer, horse, etc.,
enables them to determine the direction of the enemy.

8.
Predestination is cultivated and in most instances comes true.  I
observed this in the case of William McKinley, martyred President of
the United States of America, who said he wanted to follow in the
footsteps of James A. Garfield, also martyred President.  Let us see
how nearly he came following in his footsteps:  Born in the same
locality, President of the same country, each supported a platform of
good currency, each assassinated in the same month, and in the seat of
the Presidency.  Both died a lingering death; the difference in the
length of time of their flourishment was 8 months and 7 days.


[Figures:  Photographs of William McKinley and James A. Garfield.]


9.
Next observe the old in their feebleness and we see these well trained
hands tremble; the gland ducts and nerves are withering, the animal
magnetism is weakening, which renders them childish .

10.
The ducts, glands, and nerves throw off their magnetism in many
different ways, in exertion, fright, fear, anguish, discontent,
happiness, kindness, loveliness, desire, etc.

Dr. T. B. Robertson discovered that Tethelin (located in the pituitary
body at the base of the brain) produces the growth of the body.


CHAPTER VII
MISCELLANEOUS

1.
Lightning is caused by the friction of vapor, which is at a suitable
temperature.  Thus two or more currents of air coming together will
cause lightning, as the friction concentrates the electricity, and as
there is no conductor the heavy voltage flies usually toward the
nearest conductor.  This voltage is so great that it explodes the air.
The air coming together again produces a great vibration, called
thunder.

2.
Aurora Borealis.  The outer circle around the earth represents
atmosphere.  The sun current carries it far from the earth's surface.
At the north, when the sun's reflection strikes the earth's crust in
such a manner, its reflection will be seen in the atmosphere at a
great height, called Northern Lights.  This is mostly seen in
November, December, and January.


[Figure:  Uncaptioned line drawing (accompanying the paragraph above)
of the Earth's orbit about the sun.]


3.
The museum of Alexandria was established about 400 years B.C., for the
purpose of restoring science that had been lost thousands of years
before.

The cultivation of knowledge by experiment, observation, and
mathematical discussions:  this was the birth of a science of to-day.
The library contained many thousands of volumes of books, but was
destroyed by Cyril; a girl in charge of the library by the name of
Hypatia was brutally killed and the flesh was scraped from her bones
with sea shells.  This occurred in 414 A.D.

Alexander died at Babylon 323 B.C.

China, Mesopotamia, and India had made astronomical observations at
this early date.  Most of these learnings were destroyed.  Brono,
Isaac Newton, Brably, and some few others, promoted science by their
discoveries of what is to-day.  "Good Will to man."
