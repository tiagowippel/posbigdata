Book 05 Deuteronomy
001:001 These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond
        the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph,
        between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
001:002 It is eleven days' [journey] from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir
        to Kadesh Barnea.
001:003 It happened in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month,
        on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children
        of Israel, according to all that Yahweh had given him
        in commandment to them;
001:004 after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites,
        who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived
        in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.
001:005 Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare
        this law, saying,
001:006 Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have lived
        long enough in this mountain:
001:007 turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of
        the Amorites, and to all [the places] near there, in the Arabah,
        in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the South,
        and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon,
        as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
001:008 Behold, I have set the land before you:  go in and possess the land
        which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,
        and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.
001:009 I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear
        you myself alone:
001:010 Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this
        day as the stars of the sky for multitude.
001:011 Yahweh, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times
        as many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!
001:012 How can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden,
        and your strife?
001:013 Take wise men of understanding and well known according
        to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.
001:014 You answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken
        is good [for us] to do.
001:015 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known,
        and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains
        of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens,
        and officers, according to your tribes.
001:016 I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes]
        between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man
        and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him.
001:017 You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small
        and the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of man;
        for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard
        for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.
001:018 I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.
001:019 We traveled from Horeb, and went through all that great and
        terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill
        country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us;
        and we came to Kadesh Barnea.
001:020 I said to you, You are come to the hill country of the Amorites,
        which Yahweh our God gives to us.
001:021 Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you:
        go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
        has spoken to you; don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.
001:022 You came near to me everyone of you, and said, Let us send
        men before us, that they may search the land for us,
        and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up,
        and the cities to which we shall come.
001:023 The thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you,
        one man for every tribe:
001:024 and they turned and went up into the hill country, and came
        to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
001:025 They took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought
        it down to us, and brought us word again, and said,
        It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.
001:026 Yet you wouldn't go up, but rebelled against the commandment
        of Yahweh your God:
001:027 and you murmured in your tents, and said, Because Yahweh
        hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,
        to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
001:028 Where are we going up? our brothers have made our heart
        to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we;
        the cities are great and fortified up to the sky; and moreover
        we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.
001:029 Then I said to you, Don't dread, neither be afraid of them.
001:030 Yahweh your God who goes before you, he will fight for you,
        according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
001:031 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh
        your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way
        that you went, until you came to this place.
001:032 Yet in this thing you didn't believe Yahweh your God,
001:033 who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch
        your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you
        should go, and in the cloud by day.
001:034 Yahweh heard the voice of your words, and was angry,
        and swore, saying,
001:035 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation
        see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,
001:036 save Caleb the son of Jephunneh:  he shall see it; and to him
        will I give the land that he has trodden on, and to his children,
        because he has wholly followed Yahweh.
001:037 Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also
        shall not go in there:
001:038 Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there:
        encourage you him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
001:039 Moreover your little ones, whom you said should be a prey,
        and your children, who this day have no knowledge of good
        or evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give it,
        and they shall possess it.
001:040 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness
        by the way to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
001:041 Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against Yahweh,
        we will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God
        commanded us.  You girded on every man his weapons of war,
        and were forward to go up into the hill country.
001:042 Yahweh said to me, Tell them, Don't go up, neither fight;
        for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.
001:043 So I spoke to you, and you didn't listen; but you rebelled
        against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous,
        and went up into the hill country.
001:044 The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you,
        and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir,
        even to Hormah.
001:045 You returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn't listen
        to your voice, nor gave ear to you.
001:046 So you abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days
        that you abode [there].
002:001 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by
        the way to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}, as Yahweh spoke to me;
        and we compassed Mount Seir many days.
002:002 Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
002:003 You have compassed this mountain long enough:
        turn you northward.
002:004 Command you the people, saying, You are to pass through
        the border of your brothers the children of Esau,
        who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you:
        take good heed to yourselves therefore;
002:005 don't contend with them; for I will not give you of their land,
        no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on;
        because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.
002:006 You shall purchase food of them for money, that you may eat;
        and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.
002:007 For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand;
        he has known your walking through this great wilderness:
        these forty years Yahweh your God has been with you;
        you have lacked nothing.
002:008 So we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, who dwell
        in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber.
        We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
002:009 Yahweh said to me, Don't bother Moab, neither contend with them
        in battle; for I will not give you of his land for a possession;
        because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.
002:010 (The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and many,
        and tall, as the Anakim:
002:011 these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites
        call them Emim.
002:012 The Horites also lived in Seir before, but the children of Esau
        succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them,
        and lived in their place; as Israel did to the land of
        his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.)
002:013 Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered.  We went over
        the brook Zered.
002:014 The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea, until we
        were come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years;
        until all the generation of the men of war were consumed
        from the midst of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them.
002:015 Moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them, to destroy them
        from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.
002:016 So it happened, when all the men of war were consumed and dead
        from among the people,
002:017 that Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
002:018 You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:
002:019 and when you come near over against the children of Ammon,
        don't bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give
        you of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession;
        because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.
002:020 (That also is accounted a land of Rephaim:  Rephaim lived
        therein before; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
002:021 a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim;
        but Yahweh destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them,
        and lived in their place;
002:022 as he did for the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir,
        when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they
        succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day:
002:023 and the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza,
        the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them,
        and lived in their place.)
002:024 Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon:
        behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite,
        king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend
        with him in battle.
002:025 This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear
        of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall
        hear the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish
        because of you.
002:026 I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon
        king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
002:027 Let me pass through your land:  I will go along by the highway,
        I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.
002:028 You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me
        water for money, that I may drink:  only let me pass through
        on my feet,
002:029 as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
        who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I shall pass over the Jordan
        into the land which Yahweh our God gives us.
002:030 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him;
        for Yahweh your God hardened his spirit, and made his
        heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand,
        as at this day.
002:031 Yahweh said to me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon
        and his land before you:  begin to possess, that you may
        inherit his land.
002:032 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people,
        to battle at Jahaz.
002:033 Yahweh our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him,
        and his sons, and all his people.
002:034 We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed
        every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones;
        we left none remaining:
002:035 only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves,
        with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.
002:036 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        and [from] the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead,
        there was not a city too high for us; Yahweh our God delivered
        up all before us:
002:037 only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn't come near;
        all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country,
        and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.
003:001 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan:  and Og the king
        of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people,
        to battle at Edrei.
003:002 Yahweh said to me, Don't fear him; for I have delivered him,
        and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you
        shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,
        who lived at Heshbon.
003:003 So Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king
        of Bashan, and all his people:  and we struck him until none
        was left to him remaining.
003:004 We took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we
        didn't take from them; sixty cities, all the region of Argob,
        the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
003:005 All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars;
        besides the unwalled towns a great many.
003:006 We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon,
        utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women
        and the little ones.
003:007 But all the livestock, and the spoil of the cities, we took
        for a prey to ourselves.
003:008 We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings
        of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley
        of the Arnon to Mount Hermon;
003:009 ([which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites
        call it Senir;)
003:010 all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,
        to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
003:011 (For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of
        the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron;
        isn't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits
        was the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it,
        after the cubit of a man.)
003:012 This land we took in possession at that time:  from Aroer,
        which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country
        of Gilead, and the cities of it, gave I to the Reubenites
        and to the Gadites:
003:013 and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og,
        gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob,
        even all Bashan.  (The same is called the land of Rephaim.
003:014 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob,
        to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites,
        and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair,
        to this day.)
003:015 I gave Gilead to Machir.
003:016 To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead
        even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley,
        and the border [of it], even to the river Jabbok, which is
        the border of the children of Ammon;
003:017 the Arabah also, and the Jordan and the border [of it],
        from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea,
        under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
003:018 I commanded you at that time, saying, Yahweh your God has given
        you this land to possess it:  you shall pass over armed before
        your brothers the children of Israel, all the men of valor.
003:019 But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock,
        (I know that you have much livestock), shall abide in your
        cities which I have given you,
003:020 until Yahweh give rest to your brothers, as to you, and they
        also possess the land which Yahweh your God gives them beyond
        the Jordan:  then shall you return every man to his possession,
        which I have given you.
003:021 I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen
        all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings:
        so shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over.
003:022 You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God, he it is who
        fights for you.
003:023 I begged Yahweh at that time, saying,
003:024 Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness,
        and your strong hand:  for what god is there in heaven or
        in earth, that can do according to your works, and according
        to your mighty acts?
003:025 Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond
        the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
003:026 But Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and didn't
        listen to me; and Yahweh said to me, Let it suffice you;
        speak no more to me of this matter.
003:027 Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward,
        and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes:
        for you shall not go over this Jordan.
003:028 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him;
        for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause
        them to inherit the land which you shall see.
003:029 So we abode in the valley over against Beth Peor.
004:001 Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I
        teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess
        the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, gives you.
004:002 You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall
        you diminish from it, that you may keep the commandments
        of Yahweh your God which I command you.
004:003 Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor;
        for all the men who followed Baal Peor, Yahweh your God has
        destroyed them from the midst of you.
004:004 But you who did cleave to Yahweh your God are alive everyone
        of you this day.
004:005 Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh
        my God commanded me, that you should do so in the midst
        of the land where you go in to possess it.
004:006 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your
        understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all
        these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise
        and understanding people.
004:007 For what great nation is there, that has a god so near to them,
        as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on him?
004:008 What great nation is there, that has statutes and ordinances
        so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
004:009 Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently,
        lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they
        depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make
        them known to your children and your children's children;
004:010 the day that you stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb,
        when Yahweh said to me, Assemble me the people, and I
        will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear
        me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they
        may teach their children.
004:011 You came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain
        burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness,
        cloud, and thick darkness.
004:012 Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire:
        you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; only [you
        heard] a voice.
004:013 He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you
        to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them
        on two tables of stone.
004:014 Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes
        and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you
        go over to possess it.
004:015 Take therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no manner
        of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out
        of the midst of the fire.
004:016 Lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself an engraved image
        in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
004:017 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness
        of any winged bird that flies in the sky,
004:018 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness
        of any fish that is in the water under the earth;
004:019 and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see
        the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky,
        you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them,
        which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the peoples under
        the whole sky.
004:020 But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron
        furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance,
        as at this day.
004:021 Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes,
        and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I
        should not go in to that good land, which Yahweh your God
        gives you for an inheritance:
004:022 but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan;
        but you shall go over, and possess that good land.
004:023 Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh
        your God, which he made with you, and make you an engraved image
        in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you.
004:024 For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.
004:025 When you shall father children, and children's children, and you
        shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves,
        and make an engraved image in the form of anything, and shall
        do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God,
        to provoke him to anger;
004:026 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day,
        that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto
        you go over the Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong
        your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
004:027 Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you shall
        be left few in number among the nations, where Yahweh shall
        lead you away.
004:028 There you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone,
        which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
004:029 But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you shall
        find him, when you search after him with all your heart
        and with all your soul.
004:030 When you are in oppression, and all these things are come on you,
        in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God,
        and listen to his voice:
004:031 for Yahweh your God is a merciful God; he will not fail you,
        neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers
        which he swore to them.
004:032 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you,
        since the day that God created man on the earth, and from
        the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has
        been [any such thing] as this great thing is, or has been
        heard like it?
004:033 Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst
        of the fire, as you have heard, and live?
004:034 Or has God tried to go and take him a nation from the midst
        of [another] nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders,
        and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm,
        and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God
        did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
004:035 To you it was shown, that you might know that Yahweh he is God;
        there is none else besides him.
004:036 Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might
        instruct you:  and on earth he made you to see his great fire;
        and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.
004:037 Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their
        seed after them, and brought you out with his presence,
        with his great power, out of Egypt;
004:038 to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you,
        to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance,
        as at this day.
004:039 Know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that Yahweh
        he is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath;
        there is none else.
004:040 You shall keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I
        command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with
        your children after you, and that you may prolong your days
        in the land, which Yahweh your God gives you, forever.
004:041 Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan
        toward the sunrise;
004:042 that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unawares,
        and didn't hate him in time past; and that fleeing to one
        of these cities he might live:
004:043 [namely], Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country,
        for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites;
        and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
004:044 This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
004:045 these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances,
        which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, when they came
        forth out of Egypt,
004:046 beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth Peor,
        in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon,
        whom Moses and the children of Israel struck, when they came
        forth out of Egypt.
004:047 They took his land in possession, and the land of Og king
        of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond
        the Jordan toward the sunrise;
004:048 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        even to Mount Sion (the same is Hermon),
004:049 and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea
        of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
005:001 Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Hear, Israel,
        the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears
        this day, that you may learn them, and observe to do them.
005:002 Yahweh our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
005:003 Yahweh didn't make this covenant with our fathers, but with us,
        even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
005:004 Yahweh spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of
        the midst of the fire,
005:005 (I stood between Yahweh and you at that time, to show you
        the word of Yahweh:  for you were afraid because of the fire,
        and didn't go up onto the mountain;) saying,
005:006 "I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
        out of the house of bondage.
005:007 You shall have no other gods before me.
005:008 "You shall not make an engraved image for yourself,
        [nor] any likeness [of anything] that is in heaven above,
        or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water
        under the earth:
005:009 you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them;
        for I, Yahweh, your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity
        of the fathers on the children, and on the third and on
        the fourth generation of those who hate me;
005:010 and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me
        and keep my commandments.
005:011 "You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain:
        for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
005:012 "Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Yahweh your
        God commanded you.
005:013 Six days shall you labor, and do all your work;
005:014 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God:
        [in it] you shall not do any work, you, nor your son,
        nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant,
        nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock,
        nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male
        servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
005:015 You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt,
        and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty
        hand and by an outstretched arm:  therefore Yahweh your God
        commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
005:016 "Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you;
        that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you,
        in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
005:017 "You shall not murder.
005:018 "Neither shall you commit adultery.
005:019 "Neither shall you steal.
005:020 "Neither shall you give false testimony against your neighbor.
005:021 "Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife; neither shall you
        desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his male servant,
        or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything
        that is your neighbor's."
005:022 These words Yahweh spoke to all your assembly on the mountain
        out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the
        thick darkness, with a great voice:  and he added no more.
        He wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.
005:023 It happened, when you heard the voice out of the midst
        of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire,
        that you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes,
        and your elders;
005:024 and you said, Behold, Yahweh our God has shown us his glory
        and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst
        of the fire:  we have seen this day that God does speak with man,
        and he lives.
005:025 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will
        consume us:  if we hear the voice of Yahweh our God any more,
        then we shall die.
005:026 For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice
        of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire,
        as we have, and lived?
005:027 Go you near, and hear all that Yahweh our God shall say:
        and speak you to us all that Yahweh our God shall speak to you;
        and we will hear it, and do it.
005:028 Yahweh heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me;
        and Yahweh said to me, I have heard the voice of the words
        of this people, which they have spoken to you:
        they have well said all that they have spoken.
005:029 Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me,
        and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well
        with them, and with their children forever!
005:030 Go tell them, Return you to your tents.
005:031 But as for you, stand you here by me, and I will speak to you
        all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances,
        which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land
        which I give them to possess it.
005:032 You shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has
        commanded you:  you shall not turn aside to the right hand
        or to the left.
005:033 You shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has
        commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well
        with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land
        which you shall possess.
006:001 Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances,
        which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you, that you might
        do them in the land where you go over to possess it;
006:002 that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes
        and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son,
        and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your
        days may be prolonged.
006:003 Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it; that it
        may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily,
        as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you,
        in a land flowing with milk and honey.
006:004 Hear, Israel:  Yahweh is our God; Yahweh is one:
006:005 and you shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart,
        and with all your soul, and with all your might.
006:006 These words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart;
006:007 and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall
        talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk
        by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
006:008 You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall
        be for symbols between your eyes.
006:009 You shall write them on the door posts of your house,
        and on your gates.
006:010 It shall be, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into
        the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham,
        to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities,
        which you didn't build,
006:011 and houses full of all good things, which you didn't fill,
        and cisterns dug out, which you didn't dig, vineyards and
        olive trees, which you didn't plant, and you shall eat
        and be full;
006:012 then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you forth
        out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
006:013 You shall fear Yahweh your God; and him shall you serve,
        and shall swear by his name.
006:014 You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples
        who are round about you;
006:015 for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a jealous God;
        lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you,
        and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.
006:016 You shall not tempt Yahweh your God, as you tempted him in Massah.
006:017 You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God,
        and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.
006:018 You shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh;
        that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess
        the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,
006:019 to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
006:020 When your son asks you in time to come, saying, What mean
        the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances,
        which Yahweh our God has commanded you?
006:021 then you shall tell your son, We were Pharaoh's bondservants
        in Egypt:  and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;
006:022 and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt,
        on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;
006:023 and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in,
        to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.
006:024 Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh
        our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive,
        as at this day.
006:025 It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all this
        commandment before Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us.
007:001 When Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you
        go to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before you,
        the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite,
        and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
        seven nations greater and mightier than you;
007:002 and when Yahweh your God shall deliver them up before you,
        and you shall strike them; then you shall utterly destroy them:
        you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them;
007:003 neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you
        shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall you take
        to your son.
007:004 For he will turn away your son from following me, that they
        may serve other gods:  so will the anger of Yahweh be kindled
        against you, and he will destroy you quickly.
007:005 But thus shall you deal with them:  you shall break down their altars,
        and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim,
        and burn their engraved images with fire.
007:006 For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God:  Yahweh your
        God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession,
        above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
007:007 Yahweh didn't set his love on you, nor choose you, because you
        were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest
        of all peoples:
007:008 but because Yahweh loves you, and because he would keep the oath
        which he swore to your fathers, has Yahweh brought you out with
        a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage,
        from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
007:009 Know therefore that Yahweh your God, he is God, the faithful God,
        who keeps covenant and loving kindness with them who love
        him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,
007:010 and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them:
        he will not be slack to him who hates him, he will repay him
        to his face.
007:011 You shall therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes,
        and the ordinances, which I command you this day, to do them.
007:012 It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances,
        and keep and do them, that Yahweh your God will keep with
        you the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore
        to your fathers:
007:013 and he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you;
        he will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit
        of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil,
        the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock,
        in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you.
007:014 You shall be blessed above all peoples:  there shall not be
        male or female barren among you, or among your livestock.
007:015 Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil
        diseases of Egypt, which you know, he will put on you,
        but will lay them on all those who hate you.
007:016 You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God
        shall deliver to you; your eye shall not pity them:
        neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a
        snare to you.
007:017 If you shall say in your heart, These nations are more than I;
        how can I dispossess them?
007:018 you shall not be afraid of them:  you shall well remember
        what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;
007:019 the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs,
        and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm,
        by which Yahweh your God brought you out:  so shall Yahweh
        your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
007:020 Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them,
        until those who are left, and hide themselves,
        perish from before you.
007:021 You shall not be scared of them; for Yahweh your God is in
        the midst of you, a great and awesome God.
007:022 Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you
        by little and little:  you may not consume them at once,
        lest the animals of the field increase on you.
007:023 But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will
        confuse them with a great confusion, until they be destroyed.
007:024 He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you
        shall make their name to perish from under the sky:
        there shall no man be able to stand before you, until you
        have destroyed them.
007:025 The engraved images of their gods shall you burn with fire:
        you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them,
        nor take it to you, lest you be snared therein; for it is
        an abomination to Yahweh your God.
007:026 You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become
        a devoted thing like it:  you shall utterly detest it,
        and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
008:001 All the commandment which I command you this day shall you
        observe to do, that you may live, and multiply, and go
        in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers.
008:002 You shall remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you
        these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you,
        to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you
        would keep his commandments, or not.
008:003 He humbled you, and allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna,
        which you didn't know, neither did your fathers know;
        that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only,
        but by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of Yahweh
        does man live.
008:004 Your clothing didn't grow old on you, neither did your foot swell,
        these forty years.
008:005 You shall consider in your heart that as a man chastens his son,
        so Yahweh your God chastens you.
008:006 You shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, to walk
        in his ways, and to fear him.
008:007 For Yahweh your God brings you into a good land, a land
        of brooks of water, of springs, and underground water flowing
        into valleys and hills;
008:008 a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates;
        a land of olive trees and honey;
008:009 a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness,
        you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron,
        and out of whose hills you may dig copper.
008:010 You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless Yahweh your God
        for the good land which he has given you.
008:011 Beware lest you forget Yahweh your God, in not keeping
        his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes,
        which I command you this day:
008:012 lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built
        goodly houses, and lived therein;
008:013 and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver
        and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;
008:014 then your heart be lifted up, and you forget Yahweh your God,
        who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of
        the house of bondage;
008:015 who led you through the great and terrible wilderness,
        [in which were] fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty
        ground where was no water; who brought you forth water out
        of the rock of flint;
008:016 who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers
        didn't know; that he might humble you, and that he might prove you,
        to do you good at your latter end:
008:017 and [lest] you say in your heart, My power and the might of my
        hand has gotten me this wealth.
008:018 But you shall remember Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives
        you power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant
        which he swore to your fathers, as at this day.
008:019 It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your God, and walk
        after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify
        against you this day that you shall surely perish.
008:020 As the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you,
        so shall you perish; because you wouldn't listen to the voice
        of Yahweh your God.
009:001 Hear, Israel:  you are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go
        in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself,
        cities great and fortified up to the sky,
009:002 a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know,
        and of whom you have heard say, Who can stand before
        the sons of Anak?
009:003 Know therefore this day, that Yahweh your God is he who goes
        over before you as a devouring fire; he will destroy them,
        and he will bring them down before you:  so shall you drive
        them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Yahweh has
        spoken to you.
009:004 Don't speak in your heart, after that Yahweh your God
        has thrust them out from before you, saying, For my
        righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land;
        whereas for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh does drive
        them out from before you.
009:005 Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart,
        do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness
        of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from
        before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh
        swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
009:006 Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn't give you this
        good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are
        a stiff-necked people.
009:007 Remember, don't forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God
        to wrath in the wilderness:  from the day that you went forth
        out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place,
        you have been rebellious against Yahweh.
009:008 Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry
        with you to destroy you.
009:009 When I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone,
        even the tables of the covenant which Yahweh made with you,
        then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights;
        I did neither eat bread nor drink water.
009:010 Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written
        with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according
        to all the words, which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain
        out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
009:011 It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
        that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables
        of the covenant.
009:012 Yahweh said to me, Arise, get you down quickly from hence;
        for your people whom you have brought forth out of Egypt
        have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside
        out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them
        a molten image.
009:013 Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people,
        and behold, it is a stiff-necked people:
009:014 let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name
        from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier
        and greater than they.
009:015 So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain
        was burning with fire:  and the two tables of the covenant
        were in my two hands.
009:016 I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God;
        you had made you a molten calf:  you had turned aside quickly
        out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.
009:017 I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands,
        and broke them before your eyes.
009:018 I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days
        and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water;
        because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which
        was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.
009:019 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure,
        with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you.
        But Yahweh listened to me that time also.
009:020 Yahweh was very angry with Aaron to destroy him:
        and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
009:021 I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it
        with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it
        was as fine as dust:  and I cast the dust of it into the brook
        that descended out of the mountain.
009:022 At Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah,
        you provoked Yahweh to wrath.
009:023 When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, Go up and possess
        the land which I have given you; then you rebelled against
        the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you didn't believe him,
        nor listen to his voice.
009:024 You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that
        I knew you.
009:025 So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights
        that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you.
009:026 I prayed to Yahweh, and said, Lord Yahweh, don't destroy your
        people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through
        your greatness, that you have brought forth out of Egypt
        with a mighty hand.
009:027 Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; don't look
        to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness,
        nor to their sin,
009:028 lest the land whence you brought us out say, Because Yahweh was
        not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them,
        and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill
        them in the wilderness.
009:029 Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought
        out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.
010:001 At that time Yahweh said to me, Hew you two tables of stone
        like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain,
        and make an ark of wood.
010:002 I will write on the tables the words that were on the first
        tables which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.
010:003 So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables
        of stone like the first, and went up onto the mountain,
        having the two tables in my hand.
010:004 He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
        the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain
        out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly:
        and Yahweh gave them to me.
010:005 I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables
        in the ark which I had made; and there they are as
        Yahweh commanded me.
010:006 (The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah.
        There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son
        ministered in the priest's office in his place.
010:007 From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah
        to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
010:008 At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear
        the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh
        to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.
010:009 Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers;
        Yahweh is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your God
        spoke to him.)
010:010 I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days
        and forty nights:  and Yahweh listened to me that time also;
        Yahweh would not destroy you.
010:011 Yahweh said to me, Arise, take your journey before the people;
        and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore
        to their fathers to give to them.
010:012 Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you,
        but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways,
        and to love him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your
        heart and with all your soul,
010:013 to keep the commandments of Yahweh, and his statutes, which I
        command you this day for your good?
010:014 Behold, to Yahweh your God belongs heaven and the heaven
        of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.
010:015 Only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them,
        and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples,
        as at this day.
010:016 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be
        no more stiff-necked.
010:017 For Yahweh your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords,
        the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn't
        regard persons, nor takes reward.
010:018 He does execute justice for the fatherless and widow,
        and loves the foreigner, in giving him food and clothing.
010:019 Therefore love the foreigner; for you were foreigners in
        the land of Egypt.
010:020 You shall fear Yahweh your God; him shall you serve;
        and to him shall you cleave, and by his name shall you swear.
010:021 He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you
        these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen.
010:022 Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons;
        and now Yahweh your God has made you as the stars of the
        sky for multitude.
011:001 Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and keep his charge,
        and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, always.
011:002 Know you this day:  for I don't speak with your children
        who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement
        of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand,
        and his outstretched arm,
011:003 and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt
        to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;
011:004 and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to
        their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea{or, Sea of
        Reeds} to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how
        Yahweh has destroyed them to this day;
011:005 and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came
        to this place;
011:006 and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab,
        the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth,
        and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents,
        and every living thing that followed them, in the midst
        of all Israel:
011:007 but your eyes have seen all the great work of Yahweh which he did.
011:008 Therefore shall you keep all the commandment which I command
        you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess
        the land, where you go over to possess it;
011:009 and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh
        swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed,
        a land flowing with milk and honey.
011:010 For the land, where you go in to possess it, isn't as the land
        of Egypt, from whence you came out, where you sowed your seed,
        and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;
011:011 but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills
        and valleys, [and] drinks water of the rain of the sky,
011:012 a land which Yahweh your God cares for:  the eyes of Yahweh
        your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year
        even to the end of the year.
011:013 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments
        which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your God,
        and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
011:014 that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former
        rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain,
        and your new wine, and your oil.
011:015 I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you
        shall eat and be full.
011:016 Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you
        turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
011:017 and the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you, and he shut
        up the sky, so that there shall be no rain, and the land
        shall not yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off
        the good land which Yahweh gives you.
011:018 Therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in
        your soul; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand,
        and they shall be for symbols between your eyes.
011:019 You shall teach them your children, talking of them,
        when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way,
        and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
011:020 You shall write them on the door posts of your house,
        and on your gates;
011:021 that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children,
        in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them,
        as the days of the heavens above the earth.
011:022 For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I
        command you, to do it, to love Yahweh your God, to walk
        in all his ways, and to cleave to him;
011:023 then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you, and you
        shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
011:024 Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall
        be yours:  from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river,
        the river Euphrates, even to the hinder sea shall be your border.
011:025 There shall no man be able to stand before you:
        Yahweh your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread
        of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as he has
        spoken to you.
011:026 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:
011:027 the blessing, if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh
        your God, which I command you this day;
011:028 and the curse, if you shall not listen to the commandments
        of Yahweh your God, but turn aside out of the way which I
        command you this day, to go after other gods, which you
        have not known.
011:029 It shall happen, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into
        the land where you go to possess it, that you shall set
        the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.
011:030 Aren't they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going
        down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell
        in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?
011:031 For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land
        which Yahweh your God gives you, and you shall possess it,
        and dwell therein.
011:032 You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances
        which I set before you this day.
012:001 These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe
        to do in the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
        has given you to possess it, all the days that you live
        on the earth.
012:002 You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that
        you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains,
        and on the hills, and under every green tree:
012:003 and you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces
        their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire;
        and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods;
        and you shall destroy their name out of that place.
012:004 You shall not do so to Yahweh your God.
012:005 But to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all
        your tribes, to put his name there, even to his habitation
        shall you seek, and there you shall come;
012:006 and there you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices,
        and your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand,
        and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn
        of your herd and of your flock:
012:007 and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God, and you shall
        rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households,
        in which Yahweh your God has blessed you.
012:008 You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,
        every man whatever is right in his own eyes;
012:009 for you haven't yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,
        which Yahweh your God gives you.
012:010 But when you go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which
        Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest
        from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety;
012:011 then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God
        shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, there shall
        you bring all that I command you:  your burnt offerings,
        and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the wave offering of
        your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh.
012:012 You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your sons,
        and your daughters, and your male servants, and your
        female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates,
        because he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
012:013 Take heed to yourself that you don't offer your burnt offerings
        in every place that you see;
012:014 but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes,
        there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you
        shall do all that I command you.
012:015 Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat flesh within all
        your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to
        the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has given you:
        the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle,
        and as of the hart.
012:016 Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it out on
        the earth as water.
012:017 You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain,
        or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your
        herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow,
        nor your freewill offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand;
012:018 but you shall eat them before Yahweh your God in the place
        which Yahweh your God shall choose, you, and your son,
        and your daughter, and your male servant, and your
        female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates:
        and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God in all that you
        put your hand to.
012:019 Take heed to yourself that you don't forsake the Levite as long
        as you live in your land.
012:020 When Yahweh your God shall enlarge your border, as he has
        promised you, and you shall say, I will eat flesh,
        because your soul desires to eat flesh; you may eat flesh,
        after all the desire of your soul.
012:021 If the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to put
        his name there, be too far from you, then you shall kill
        of your herd and of your flock, which Yahweh has given you,
        as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates,
        after all the desire of your soul.
012:022 Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so you shall eat of it:
        the unclean and the clean may eat of it alike.
012:023 Only be sure that you don't eat the blood:  for the blood
        is the life; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh.
012:024 You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth as water.
012:025 You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with
        your children after you, when you shall do that which is
        right in the eyes of Yahweh.
012:026 Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take,
        and go to the place which Yahweh shall choose:
012:027 and you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood,
        on the altar of Yahweh your God; and the blood of your
        sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Yahweh your God;
        and you shall eat the flesh.
012:028 Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it
        may go well with you, and with your children after you forever,
        when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of
        Yahweh your God.
012:029 When Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations from before you,
        where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them,
        and dwell in their land;
012:030 take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them,
        after that they are destroyed from before you; and that you
        not inquire after their gods, saying, How do these nations
        serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
012:031 You shall not do so to Yahweh your God:  for every abomination
        to Yahweh, which he hates, have they done to their gods;
        for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire
        to their gods.
012:032 Whatever thing I command you, that shall you observe to do:
        you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
013:001 If there arise in the midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer
        of dreams, and he give you a sign or a wonder,
013:002 and the sign or the wonder come to pass, of which he spoke
        to you, saying, Let us go after other gods, which you have
        not known, and let us serve them;
013:003 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to
        that dreamer of dreams:  for Yahweh your God proves you,
        to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart
        and with all your soul.
013:004 You shall walk after Yahweh your God, and fear him, and keep
        his commandments, and obey his voice, and you shall serve him,
        and cleave to him.
013:005 That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death,
        because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh your God,
        who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
        you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out
        of the way which Yahweh your God commanded you to walk in.
        So shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
013:006 If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son,
        or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend,
        who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let us
        go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you,
        nor your fathers;
013:007 of the gods of the peoples who are round about you, near to you,
        or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even
        to the other end of the earth;
013:008 you shall not consent to him, nor listen to him; neither shall
        your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall
        you conceal him:
013:009 but you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first on him
        to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
013:010 You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has
        sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God, who brought
        you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
013:011 All Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more
        such wickedness as this is in the midst of you.
013:012 If you shall hear tell concerning one of your cities,
        which Yahweh your God gives you to dwell there, saying,
013:013 Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of you,
        and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us
        go and serve other gods, which you have not known;
013:014 then shall you inquire, and make search, and ask diligently;
        and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain,
        that such abomination is done in the midst of you,
013:015 you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge
        of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein
        and the livestock of it, with the edge of the sword.
013:016 You shall gather all the spoil of it into the midst
        of the street of it, and shall burn with fire the city,
        and all the spoil of it every whit, to Yahweh your God:
        and it shall be a heap forever; it shall not be built again.
013:017 There shall cleave nothing of the devoted thing to your hand;
        that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger,
        and show you mercy, and have compassion on you, and multiply you,
        as he has sworn to your fathers;
013:018 when you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God,
        to keep all his commandments which I command you this day,
        to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.
014:001 You are the children of Yahweh your God:  you shall not
        cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes
        for the dead.
014:002 For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God, and Yahweh
        has chosen you to be a people for his own possession,
        above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
014:003 You shall not eat any abominable thing.
014:004 These are the animals which you may eat:  the ox, the sheep,
        and the goat,
014:005 the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat,
        and the ibex, and the antelope, and the chamois.
014:006 Every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two,
        [and] chews the cud, among the animals, that may you eat.
014:007 Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud,
        or of those who have the hoof cloven:  the camel, and the hare,
        and the rabbit; because they chew the cud but don't part the hoof,
        they are unclean to you.
014:008 The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn't chew the cud,
        is unclean to you:  of their flesh you shall not eat,
        and their carcasses you shall not touch.
014:009 These you may eat of all that are in the waters:
        whatever has fins and scales may you eat;
014:010 and whatever doesn't have fins and scales you shall not eat;
        it is unclean to you.
014:011 Of all clean birds you may eat.
014:012 But these are they of which you shall not eat:  the eagle,
        and the vulture, and the osprey,
014:013 and the red kite, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind,
014:014 and every raven after its kind,
014:015 and the ostrich, and the owl, and the seagull, and the hawk
        after its kind,
014:016 the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl,
014:017 and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant,
014:018 and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe,
        and the bat.
014:019 All winged creeping things are unclean to you:  they shall
        not be eaten.
014:020 Of all clean birds you may eat.
014:021 You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself:
        you may give it to the foreigner living among you who is
        within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it
        to a foreigner:  for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God.
        You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
014:022 You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed,
        that which comes forth from the field year by year.
014:023 You shall eat before Yahweh your God, in the place
        which he shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there,
        the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil,
        and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock; that you
        may learn to fear Yahweh your God always.
014:024 If the way be too long for you, so that you are not able
        to carry it, because the place is too far from you,
        which Yahweh your God shall choose, to set his name there,
        when Yahweh your God shall bless you;
014:025 then shall you turn it into money, and bind up the money
        in your hand, and shall go to the place which Yahweh your
        God shall choose:
014:026 and you shall bestow the money for whatever your soul desires,
        for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink,
        or for whatever your soul asks of you; and you shall eat
        there before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice,
        you and your household.
014:027 The Levite who is within your gates, you shall not forsake him;
        for he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
014:028 At the end of every three years you shall bring forth all
        the tithe of your increase in the same year, and shall lay
        it up within your gates:
014:029 and the Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you,
        and the foreigner living among you, and the fatherless,
        and the widow, who are within your gates, shall come,
        and shall eat and be satisfied; that Yahweh your God may bless
        you in all the work of your hand which you do.
015:001 At the end of every seven years you shall make a release.
015:002 This is the manner of the release:  every creditor
        shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor;
        he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother;
        because Yahweh's release has been proclaimed.
015:003 Of a foreigner you may exact it:  but whatever of your is
        with your brother your hand shall release.
015:004 However there shall be no poor with you; (for Yahweh will
        surely bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you
        for an inheritance to possess it;)
015:005 if only you diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God,
        to observe to do all this commandment which I command
        you this day.
015:006 For Yahweh your God will bless you, as he promised you:
        and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow;
        and you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not
        rule over you.
015:007 If there be with you a poor man, one of your brothers,
        within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God
        gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand
        from your poor brother;
015:008 but you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely
        lend him sufficient for his need [in that] which he wants.
015:009 Beware that there not be a base thought in your heart, saying,
        The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and your eye
        be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing;
        and he cry to Yahweh against you, and it be sin to you.
015:010 You shall surely give him, and your heart shall not be grieved
        when you give to him; because that for this thing Yahweh
        your God will bless you in all your work, and in all that you
        put your hand to.
015:011 For the poor will never cease out of the land:
        therefore I command you, saying, You shall surely open
        your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor,
        in your land.
015:012 If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold to you,
        and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall
        let him go free from you.
015:013 When you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty:
015:014 you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock,
        and out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress;
        as Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall give to him.
015:015 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land
        of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you:  therefore I
        command you this thing today.
015:016 It shall be, if he tell you, I will not go out from you;
        because he loves you and your house, because he is well with you;
015:017 then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear
        to the door, and he shall be your servant forever.
        Also to your female servant you shall do likewise.
015:018 It shall not seem hard to you, when you let him go free from you;
        for to the double of the hire of a hireling has he served
        you six years:  and Yahweh your God will bless you in all
        that you do.
015:019 All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and
        of your flock you shall sanctify to Yahweh your God:
        you shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd,
        nor shear the firstborn of your flock.
015:020 You shall eat it before Yahweh your God year by year in the place
        which Yahweh shall choose, you and your household.
015:021 If it have any blemish, [as if it be] lame or blind, any ill
        blemish whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God.
015:022 You shall eat it within your gates:  the unclean and the clean
        [shall eat it] alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.
015:023 Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it out on
        the ground as water.
016:001 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God;
        for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you forth
        out of Egypt by night.
016:002 You shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God, of the flock
        and the herd, in the place which Yahweh shall choose,
        to cause his name to dwell there.
016:003 You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you
        eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction;
        for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste:
        that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land
        of Egypt all the days of your life.
016:004 There shall be no yeast seen with you in all your borders
        seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which you sacrifice
        the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.
016:005 You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates,
        which Yahweh your God gives you;
016:006 but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause
        his name to dwell in, there you shall sacrifice the Passover
        at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you
        came forth out of Egypt.
016:007 You shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God
        shall choose:  and you shall turn in the morning, and go
        to your tents.
016:008 Six days you shall eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh
        day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God; you shall
        do no work [therein].
016:009 Seven weeks shall you number to you:  from the time you begin
        to put the sickle to the standing grain shall you begin
        to number seven weeks.
016:010 You shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute
        of a freewill offering of your hand, which you shall give,
        according as Yahweh your God blesses you:
016:011 and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your son,
        and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant,
        and the Levite who is within your gates, and the foreigner,
        and the fatherless, and the widow, who are in the midst of you,
        in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause
        his name to dwell there.
016:012 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt:
        and you shall observe and do these statutes.
016:013 You shall keep the feast of tents seven days, after that you have
        gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress:
016:014 and you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son,
        and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant,
        and the Levite, and the foreigner, and the fatherless,
        and the widow, who are within your gates.
016:015 Seven days shall you keep a feast to Yahweh your God in the place
        which Yahweh shall choose; because Yahweh your God will bless
        you in all your increase, and in all the work of your hands,
        and you shall be altogether joyful.
016:016 Three times in a year shall all your males appear before
        Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose:
        in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks,
        and in the feast of tents; and they shall not appear
        before Yahweh empty:
016:017 every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing
        of Yahweh your God which he has given you.
016:018 Judges and officers shall you make you in all your gates,
        which Yahweh your God gives you, according to your tribes;
        and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
016:019 You shall not wrest justice:  you shall not respect persons;
        neither shall you take a bribe; for a bribe does blind the eyes
        of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.
016:020 That which is altogether just shall you follow, that you may live,
        and inherit the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
016:021 You shall not plant you an Asherah of any kind of tree beside
        the altar of Yahweh your God, which you shall make you.
016:022 Neither shall you set yourself up a pillar; which Yahweh
        your God hates.
017:001 You shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox, or a sheep,
        in which is a blemish, [or] anything evil; for that is an
        abomination to Yahweh your God.
017:002 If there be found in the midst of you, within any of your
        gates which Yahweh your God gives you, man or woman,
        who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God,
        in transgressing his covenant,
017:003 and has gone and served other gods, and worshiped them,
        or the sun, or the moon, or any of the army of the sky,
        which I have not commanded;
017:004 and it be told you, and you have heard of it, then shall you
        inquire diligently; and behold, if it be true, and the thing certain,
        that such abomination is done in Israel,
017:005 then shall you bring forth that man or that woman, who has done
        this evil thing, to your gates, even the man or the woman;
        and you shall stone them to death with stones.
017:006 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he who is
        to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he shall
        not be put to death.
017:007 The hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put
        him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people.
        So you shall put away the evil from the midst of you.
017:008 If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment,
        between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke
        and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates;
        then shall you arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh
        your God shall choose;
017:009 and you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge
        who shall be in those days:  and you shall inquire;
        and they shall show you the sentence of judgment.
017:010 You shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they
        shall show you from that place which Yahweh shall choose;
        and you shall observe to do according to all that they
        shall teach you:
017:011 according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach you,
        and according to the judgment which they shall tell you,
        you shall do; you shall not turn aside from the sentence
        which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left.
017:012 The man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest
        who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God,
        or to the judge, even that man shall die:  and you shall put
        away the evil from Israel.
017:013 All the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
017:014 When you are come to the land which Yahweh your God gives you,
        and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say,
        I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are
        round about me;
017:015 you shall surely set him king over you, whom Yahweh your
        God shall choose:  one from among your brothers shall you
        set king over you; you may not put a foreigner over you,
        who is not your brother.
017:016 Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people
        to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses;
        because Yahweh has said to you, You shall henceforth return
        no more that way.
017:017 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart
        not turn away:  neither shall he greatly multiply to himself
        silver and gold.
017:018 It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom,
        that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book,
        out of [that which is] before the priests the Levites:
017:019 and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days
        of his life; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God,
        to keep all the words of this law and these statutes,
        to do them;
017:020 that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not
        turn aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left:
        to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom,
        he and his children, in the midst of Israel.
018:001 The priests the Levites, [even] all the tribe of Levi,
        shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel:
        they shall eat the offerings of Yahweh made by fire,
        and his inheritance.
018:002 They shall have no inheritance among their brothers:
        Yahweh is their inheritance, as he has spoken to them.
018:003 This shall be the priests' due from the people, from those
        who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they
        shall give to the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks,
        and the maw.
018:004 The first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil,
        and the first of the fleece of your sheep, shall you give him.
018:005 For Yahweh your God has chosen him out of all your tribes,
        to stand to minister in the name of Yahweh, him and his
        sons for ever.
018:006 If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel,
        where he lives as a foreigner, and comes with all the desire
        of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose;
018:007 then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his God, as all
        his brothers the Levites do, who stand there before Yahweh.
018:008 They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which comes
        of the sale of his patrimony.
018:009 When you are come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you,
        you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.
018:010 There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his
        daughter to pass through the fire, one who uses divination,
        one who practices sorcery, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,
018:011 or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard,
        or a necromancer.
018:012 For whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh:
        and because of these abominations Yahweh your God does drive
        them out from before you.
018:013 You shall be perfect with Yahweh your God.
018:014 For these nations, that you shall dispossess, listen to those
        who practice sorcery, and to diviners; but as for you,
        Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to do.
018:015 Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst
        of you, of your brothers, like me; to him you shall listen;
018:016 according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb
        in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again
        the voice of Yahweh my God, neither let me see this great fire
        any more, that I not die.
018:017 Yahweh said to me, They have well said that which they have spoken.
018:018 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers,
        like you; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall
        speak to them all that I shall command him.
018:019 It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words
        which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.
018:020 But the prophet, who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name,
        which I have not commanded him to speak, or who shall speak
        in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.
018:021 If you say in your heart, How shall we know the word which Yahweh
        has not spoken?
018:022 when a prophet speaks in the name of Yahweh, if the thing
        doesn't follow, nor happen, that is the thing which Yahweh
        has not spoken:  the prophet has spoken it presumptuously,
        you shall not be afraid of him.
019:001 When Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations, whose land
        Yahweh your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell
        in their cities, and in their houses;
019:002 you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land,
        which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.
019:003 You shall prepare you the way, and divide the borders of your land,
        which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, into three parts,
        that every manslayer may flee there.
019:004 This is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee there and live:
        whoever kills his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him
        in time past;
019:005 as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood,
        and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree,
        and the head slips from the handle, and lights on his neighbor,
        so that he dies; he shall flee to one of these cities and live:
019:006 lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his
        heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long,
        and strike him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death,
        inasmuch as he didn't hate him in time past.
019:007 Therefore I command you, saying, You shall set apart three
        cities for you.
019:008 If Yahweh your God enlarge your border, as he has sworn
        to your fathers, and give you all the land which he promised
        to give to your fathers;
019:009 if you shall keep all this commandment to do it, which I command
        you this day, to love Yahweh your God, and to walk ever
        in his ways; then shall you add three cities more for you,
        besides these three:
019:010 that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land,
        which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance,
        and so blood be on you.
019:011 But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him,
        and rise up against him, and strike him mortally so that he dies,
        and he flee into one of these cities;
019:012 then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there,
        and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood,
        that he may die.
019:013 Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the innocent
        blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.
019:014 You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old
        time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit,
        in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.
019:015 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity,
        or for any sin, in any sin that he sins:  at the mouth
        of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses,
        shall a matter be established.
019:016 If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify
        against him of wrong-doing,
019:017 then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand
        before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges who shall
        be in those days;
019:018 and the judges shall make diligent inquisition:  and, behold,
        if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely
        against his brother;
019:019 then shall you do to him, as he had thought to do to his brother:
        so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
019:020 Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth
        commit no more any such evil in the midst of you.
019:021 Your eyes shall not pity; life [shall go] for life, eye for eye,
        tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
020:001 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and see horses,
        and chariots, [and] a people more than you, you shall
        not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God is with you,
        who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
020:002 It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest
        shall approach and speak to the people,
020:003 and shall tell them, Hear, Israel, you draw near this day
        to battle against your enemies:  don't let your heart faint;
        don't be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them;
020:004 for Yahweh your God is he who goes with you, to fight for you
        against your enemies, to save you.
020:005 The officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man is
        there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let
        him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle,
        and another man dedicate it.
020:006 What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not
        used the fruit of it? let him go and return to his house,
        lest he die in the battle, and another man use the fruit of it.
020:007 What man is there who has pledged to be married a wife,
        and has not taken her? let him go and return to his house,
        lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
020:008 The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say,
        What man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? let him
        go and return to his house, lest his brother's heart melt
        as his heart.
020:009 It shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking
        to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies
        at the head of the people.
020:010 When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim
        peace to it.
020:011 It shall be, if it make you answer of peace, and open to you,
        then it shall be, that all the people who are found therein
        shall become tributary to you, and shall serve you.
020:012 If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you,
        then you shall besiege it:
020:013 and when Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand, you shall
        strike every male of it with the edge of the sword:
020:014 but the women, and the little ones, and the livestock,
        and all that is in the city, even all the spoil of it,
        shall you take for a prey to yourself; and you shall eat
        the spoil of your enemies, which Yahweh your God has given you.
020:015 Thus shall you do to all the cities which are very far off
        from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.
020:016 But of the cities of these peoples, that Yahweh your God gives you
        for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes;
020:017 but you shall utterly destroy them:  the Hittite, and the Amorite,
        the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite;
        as Yahweh your God has commanded you;
020:018 that they not teach you to do after all their abominations,
        which they have done to their gods; so would you sin against
        Yahweh your God.
020:019 When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war
        against it to take it, you shall not destroy the trees of it
        by wielding an axe against them; for you may eat of them,
        and you shall not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man,
        that it should be besieged of you?
020:020 Only the trees of which you know that they are not trees
        for food, you shall destroy and cut them down; and you shall
        build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you,
        until it fall.
021:001 If one be found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives
        you to possess it, lying in the field, and it isn't known
        who has struck him;
021:002 then your elders and your judges shall come forth, and they shall
        measure to the cities which are round about him who is slain:
021:003 and it shall be, that the city which is nearest to the slain man,
        even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd,
        which hasn't been worked with, and which has not drawn
        in the yoke;
021:004 and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a
        valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown,
        and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley.
021:005 The priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Yahweh
        your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name
        of Yahweh; and according to their word shall every controversy
        and every stroke be.
021:006 All the elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain man,
        shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken
        in the valley;
021:007 and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood,
        neither have our eyes seen it.
021:008 Forgive, Yahweh, your people Israel, whom you have redeemed,
        and don't allow innocent blood [to remain] in the midst
        of your people Israel.  The blood shall be forgiven them.
021:009 So shall you put away the innocent blood from the midst of you,
        when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.
021:010 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh
        your God delivers them into your hands, and you carry
        them away captive,
021:011 and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have
        a desire to her, and would take her to you as wife;
021:012 then you shall bring her home to your house; and she shall
        shave her head, and pare her nails;
021:013 and she shall put the clothing of her captivity from off her,
        and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her
        mother a full month:  and after that you shall go in to her,
        and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
021:014 It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall
        let her go where she will; but you shall not sell her at
        all for money, you shall not deal with her as a slave,
        because you have humbled her.
021:015 If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated,
        and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated;
        and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated;
021:016 then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons
        to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son
        of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated,
        who is the firstborn:
021:017 but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated,
        by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is
        the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.
021:018 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey
        the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and,
        though they chasten him, will not listen to them;
021:019 then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him,
        and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate
        of his place;
021:020 and they shall tell the elders of his city, This our son
        is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice;
        he is a glutton, and a drunkard.
021:021 All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones:
        so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you;
        and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
021:022 If a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put
        to death, and you hang him on a tree;
021:023 his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall
        surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed
        of God; that you don't defile your land which Yahweh your God
        gives you for an inheritance.
022:001 You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep go astray,
        and hide yourself from them:  you shall surely bring them
        again to your brother.
022:002 If your brother isn't near to you, or if you don't know him,
        then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall
        be with you until your brother seek after it, and you shall
        restore it to him.
022:003 So shall you do with his donkey; and so shall you do with
        his garment; and so shall you do with every lost thing
        of your brother's, which he has lost, and you have found:
        you may not hide yourself.
022:004 You shall not see your brother's donkey or his ox
        fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them:
        you shall surely help him to lift them up again.
022:005 A woman shall not wear men's clothing, neither shall a man
        put on women's clothing; for whoever does these things is
        an abomination to Yahweh your God.
022:006 If a bird's nest chance to be before you in the way,
        in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs,
        and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall
        not take the hen with the young:
022:007 you shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take
        to yourself; that it may be well with you, and that you may
        prolong your days.
022:008 When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement
        for your roof, that you don't bring blood on your house,
        if any man fall from there.
022:009 You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed,
        lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which you have sown,
        and the increase of the vineyard.
022:010 You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
022:011 You shall not wear a mixed stuff, wool and linen together.
022:012 You shall make yourselves fringes{or, tassles} on the four
        borders of your cloak, with which you cover yourself.
022:013 If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and hates her,
022:014 and accuses her of shameful things, and brings up an evil name
        on her, and says, I took this woman, and when I came near to her,
        I didn't find in her the tokens of virginity;
022:015 then shall the father of the young lady, and her mother,
        take and bring forth the tokens of the young lady's virginity
        to the elders of the city in the gate;
022:016 and the young lady's father shall tell the elders, I gave
        my daughter to this man to wife, and he hates her;
022:017 and behold, he has laid shameful things [to her charge], saying,
        I didn't find in your daughter the tokens of virginity;
        and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity.
        They shall spread the garment before the elders of the city.
022:018 The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him;
022:019 and they shall fine him one hundred [shekels] of silver,
        and give them to the father of the young lady, because he has
        brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel:  and she shall
        be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
022:020 But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were
        not found in the young lady;
022:021 then they shall bring out the young lady to the door
        of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone
        her to death with stones, because she has done folly
        in Israel, to play the prostitute in her father's house:
        so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
022:022 If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband,
        then they shall both of them die, the man who lay with the woman,
        and the woman:  so shall you put away the evil from Israel.
022:023 If there be a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married
        to a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;
022:024 then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city,
        and you shall stone them to death with stones;
        the lady, because she didn't cry, being in the city;
        and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife:
        so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you.
022:025 But if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married
        in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her;
        then the man only who lay with her shall die:
022:026 but to the lady you shall do nothing; there is in the lady no sin
        worthy of death:  for as when a man rises against his neighbor,
        and kills him, even so is this matter;
022:027 for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married
        lady cried, and there was none to save her.
022:028 If a man find a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged
        to be married, and lay hold on her, and lie with her,
        and they be found;
022:029 then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady's father
        fifty [shekels] of silver, and she shall be his wife,
        because he has humbled her; he may not put her away all his days.
022:030 A man shall not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover
        his father's skirt.
023:001 He who is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off,
        shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
023:002 A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh;
        even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into
        the assembly of Yahweh.
023:003 An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly
        of Yahweh; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging
        to them enter into the assembly of Yahweh forever:
023:004 because they didn't meet you with bread and with water in the way,
        when you came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired
        against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia,
        to curse you.
023:005 Nevertheless Yahweh your God wouldn't listen to Balaam;
        but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a blessing to you,
        because Yahweh your God loved you.
023:006 You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all
        your days forever.
023:007 You shall not abhor an Edomite; for he is your brother:
        you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner
        in his land.
023:008 The children of the third generation who are born to them
        shall enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
023:009 When you go forth in camp against your enemies, then you shall
        keep you from every evil thing.
023:010 If there be among you any man, who is not clean by reason
        of that which happens him by night, then shall he go abroad
        out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:
023:011 but it shall be, when evening comes on, he shall bathe
        himself in water; and when the sun is down, he shall come
        within the camp.
023:012 You shall have a place also outside of the camp, where you
        shall go forth abroad:
023:013 and you shall have a paddle among your weapons; and it shall be,
        when you sit down abroad, you shall dig therewith, and shall
        turn back and cover that which comes from you:
023:014 for Yahweh your God walks in the midst of your camp,
        to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you;
        therefore shall your camp be holy, that he may not see
        an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.
023:015 You shall not deliver to his master a servant who is escaped
        from his master to you:
023:016 he shall dwell with you, in the midst of you, in the place which
        he shall choose within one of your gates, where it pleases him best:
        you shall not oppress him.
023:017 There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel,
        neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel.
023:018 You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute, or the wages
        of a dog, into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow:
        for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God.
023:019 You shall not lend on interest to your brother; interest of money,
        interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest:
023:020 to a foreigner you may lend on interest; but to your brother
        you shall not lend on interest, that Yahweh your God may bless
        you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you
        go in to possess it.
023:021 When you shall vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack
        to pay it:  for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you;
        and it would be sin in you.
023:022 But if you shall forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in you.
023:023 That which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do;
        according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God, a freewill offering,
        which you have promised with your mouth.
023:024 When you come into your neighbor's vineyard, then you may eat
        of grapes your fill at your own pleasure; but you shall not
        put any in your vessel.
023:025 When you come into your neighbor's standing grain, then you
        may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not move
        a sickle to your neighbor's standing grain.
024:001 When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it shall be,
        if she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some
        unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a bill of divorce,
        and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
024:002 When she is departed out of his house, she may go and be
        another man's [wife].
024:003 If the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorce,
        and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house;
        or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;
024:004 her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again
        to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination
        before Yahweh:  and you shall not cause the land to sin,
        which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.
024:005 When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out in the army,
        neither shall he be charged with any business:
        he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife
        whom he has taken.
024:006 No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge;
        for he takes [a man's] life to pledge.
024:007 If a man be found stealing any of his brothers of the children
        of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, or sell him;
        then that thief shall die:  so shall you put away the evil
        from the midst of you.
024:008 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently,
        and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall
        teach you:  as I commanded them, so you shall observe to do.
024:009 Remember what Yahweh your God did to Miriam, by the way as you
        came forth out of Egypt.
024:010 When you do lend your neighbor any manner of loan, you shall
        not go into his house to get his pledge.
024:011 You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you do lend shall
        bring forth the pledge outside to you.
024:012 If he be a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge;
024:013 you shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun
        goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you:
        and it shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God.
024:014 You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy,
        whether he be of your brothers, or of your foreigners who are
        in your land within your gates:
024:015 in his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun
        go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his heart on it:
        lest he cry against you to Yahweh, and it be sin to you.
024:016 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
        neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers:
        every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
024:017 You shall not wrest the justice [due] to the foreigner,
        [or] to the fatherless, nor take the widow's clothing to pledge;
024:018 but you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt,
        and Yahweh your God redeemed you there:  therefore I command
        you to do this thing.
024:019 When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgot
        a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it:
        it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for
        the widow; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work
        of your hands.
024:020 When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the
        boughs again:  it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless,
        and for the widow.
024:021 When you gather [the grapes of] your vineyard, you shall
        not glean it after you:  it shall be for the foreigner,
        for the fatherless, and for the widow.
024:022 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt:
        therefore I command you to do this thing.
025:001 If there be a controversy between men, and they come to judgment,
        and [the judges] judge them; then they shall justify the righteous,
        and condemn the wicked;
025:002 and it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten,
        that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten
        before his face, according to his wickedness, by number.
025:003 Forty stripes he may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he
        should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes,
        then your brother should seem vile to you.
025:004 You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out [the grain].
025:005 If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no son,
        the wife of the dead shall not be married outside to a stranger:
        her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him
        as wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her.
025:006 It shall be, that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed
        in the name of his brother who is dead, that his name not be
        blotted out of Israel.
025:007 If the man doesn't want to take his brother's wife, then his
        brother's wife shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say,
        My husband's brother refuses to raise up to his brother
        a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband's
        brother to me.
025:008 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him:
        and if he stand, and say, I don't want to take her;
025:009 then his brother's wife shall come to him in the presence
        of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit
        in his face; and she shall answer and say, So shall it be done
        to the man who does not build up his brother's house.
025:010 His name shall be called in Israel, The house of him who has
        his shoe untied.
025:011 When men strive together one with another, and the wife
        of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand
        of him who strikes him, and puts forth her hand, and takes
        him by the secrets;
025:012 then you shall cut off her hand, your eye shall have no pity.
025:013 You shall not have in your bag diverse weights, a great
        and a small.
025:014 You shall not have in your house diverse measures, a great
        and a small.
025:015 A perfect and just weight shall you have; a perfect and just
        measure shall you have:  that your days may be long in the land
        which Yahweh your God gives you.
025:016 For all who do such things, [even] all who do unrighteously,
        are an abomination to Yahweh your God.
025:017 Remember what Amalek did to you by the way as you came forth
        out of Egypt;
025:018 how he met you by the way, and struck the hindmost of you,
        all who were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary;
        and he didn't fear God.
025:019 Therefore it shall be, when Yahweh your God has given you
        rest from all your enemies round about, in the land which
        Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it,
        that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky;
        you shall not forget.
026:001 It shall be, when you are come in to the land which Yahweh
        your God gives you for an inheritance, and possess it,
        and dwell therein,
026:002 that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground,
        which you shall bring in from your land that Yahweh your God
        gives you; and you shall put it in a basket, and shall go
        to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause
        his name to dwell there.
026:003 You shall come to the priest who shall be in those days,
        and tell him, I profess this day to Yahweh your God,
        that I am come to the land which Yahweh swore to our fathers
        to give us.
026:004 The priest shall take the basket out of your hand, and set it
        down before the altar of Yahweh your God.
026:005 You shall answer and say before Yahweh your God, A Syrian
        ready to perish was my father; and he went down into Egypt,
        and sojourned there, few in number; and he became there
        a nation, great, mighty, and populous.
026:006 The Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid
        on us hard bondage:
026:007 and we cried to Yahweh, the God of our fathers, and Yahweh
        heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil,
        and our oppression;
026:008 and Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand,
        and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror,
        and with signs, and with wonders;
026:009 and he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land,
        a land flowing with milk and honey.
026:010 Now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground,
        which you, Yahweh, have given me.  You shall set it down
        before Yahweh your God, and worship before Yahweh your God.
026:011 You shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God
        has given to you, and to your house, you, and the Levite,
        and the foreigner who is in the midst of you.
026:012 When you have made an end of tithing all the tithe of your
        increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing,
        then you shall give it to the Levite, to the foreigner,
        to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within
        your gates, and be filled.
026:013 You shall say before Yahweh your God, I have put away the holy
        things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite,
        and to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow,
        according to all your commandment which you have commanded me:
        I have not transgressed any of your commandments, neither have
        I forgotten them:
026:014 I have not eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I put
        away of it, being unclean, nor given of it for the dead:
        I have listened to the voice of Yahweh my God; I have done
        according to all that you have commanded me.
026:015 Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless
        your people Israel, and the ground which you have given us,
        as you swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
026:016 This day Yahweh your God commands you to do these statutes
        and ordinances:  you shall therefore keep and do them with all
        your heart, and with all your soul.
026:017 You have declared Yahweh this day to be your God, and that you would
        walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments,
        and his ordinances, and listen to his voice:
026:018 and Yahweh has declared you this day to be a people for his
        own possession, as he has promised you, and that you should
        keep all his commandments;
026:019 and to make you high above all nations that he has made,
        in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that you may be
        a holy people to Yahweh your God, as he has spoken.
027:001 Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying,
        Keep all the commandment which I command you this day.
027:002 It shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan
        to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, that you shall
        set yourself up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:
027:003 and you shall write on them all the words of this law, when you
        are passed over; that you may go in to the land which Yahweh
        your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey,
        as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised you.
027:004 It shall be, when you are passed over the Jordan, that you
        shall set up these stones, which I command you this day,
        in Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.
027:005 There shall you build an altar to Yahweh your God, an altar
        of stones:  you shall lift up no iron [tool] on them.
027:006 You shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones;
        and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God:
027:007 and you shall sacrifice peace offerings, and shall eat there;
        and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God.
027:008 You shall write on the stones all the words of this
        law very plainly.
027:009 Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying,
        Keep silence, and listen, Israel:  this day you are become
        the people of Yahweh your God.
027:010 You shall therefore obey the voice of Yahweh your God,
        and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command
        you this day.
027:011 Moses charged the people the same day, saying,
027:012 These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people,
        when you are passed over the Jordan:  Simeon, and Levi,
        and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin.
027:013 These shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse:  Reuben, Gad,
        and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
027:014 The Levites shall answer, and tell all the men of Israel
        with a loud voice,
027:015 Cursed be the man who makes an engraved or molten image,
        an abomination to Yahweh, the work of the hands of the craftsman,
        and sets it up in secret.  All the people shall answer
        and say, Amen.
027:016 Cursed be he who sets light by his father or his mother.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:017 Cursed be he who removes his neighbor's landmark.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:018 Cursed be he who makes the blind to wander out of the way.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:019 Cursed be he who wrests the justice [due] to the foreigner,
        fatherless, and widow.  All the people shall say, Amen.
027:020 Cursed be he who lies with his father's wife, because he has
        uncovered his father's skirt.  All the people shall say, Amen.
027:021 Cursed be he who lies with any manner of animal.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:022 Cursed be he who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father,
        or the daughter of his mother.  All the people shall say, Amen.
027:023 Cursed be he who lies with his mother-in-law. All the people
        shall say, Amen.
027:024 Cursed be he who strikes his neighbor in secret.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:025 Cursed be he who takes a bribe to kill an innocent person.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:026 Cursed be he who doesn't confirm the words of this law to do them.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
028:001 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to the voice
        of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all his commandments
        which I command you this day, that Yahweh your God will set
        you on high above all the nations of the earth:
028:002 and all these blessings shall come on you, and overtake you,
        if you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.
028:003 Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be
        in the field.
028:004 Blessed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground,
        and the fruit of your animals, the increase of your livestock,
        and the young of your flock.
028:005 Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading trough.
028:006 Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you
        be when you go out.
028:007 Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be
        struck before you:  they shall come out against you one way,
        and shall flee before you seven ways.
028:008 Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your barns,
        and in all that you put your hand to; and he will bless you
        in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
028:009 Yahweh will establish you for a holy people to himself,
        as he has sworn to you; if you shall keep the commandments
        of Yahweh your God, and walk in his ways.
028:010 All the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called
        by the name of Yahweh; and they shall be afraid of you.
028:011 Yahweh will make you plenteous for good, in the fruit of your body,
        and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground,
        in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give you.
028:012 Yahweh will open to you his good treasure in the sky,
        to give the rain of your land in its season, and to bless all
        the work of your hand:  and you shall lend to many nations,
        and you shall not borrow.
028:013 Yahweh will make you the head, and not the tail;
        and you shall be above only, and you shall not be beneath;
        if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God,
        which I command you this day, to observe and to do [them],
028:014 and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I
        command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left,
        to go after other gods to serve them.
028:015 But it shall come to pass, if you will not listen to the voice
        of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all his commandments
        and his statutes which I command you this day, that all
        these curses shall come on you, and overtake you.
028:016 Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be
        in the field.
028:017 Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading trough.
028:018 Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground,
        the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock.
028:019 Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you
        be when you go out.
028:020 Yahweh will send on you cursing, confusion, and rebuke,
        in all that you put your hand to do, until you are destroyed,
        and until you perish quickly; because of the evil of your doings,
        by which you have forsaken me.
028:021 Yahweh will make the pestilence cleave to you, until he has
        consumed you from off the land, where you go in to possess it.
028:022 Yahweh will strike you with consumption, and with fever,
        and with inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with the sword,
        and with blight, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you
        until you perish.
028:023 Your sky that is over your head shall be brass, and the earth
        that is under you shall be iron.
028:024 Yahweh will make the rain of your land powder and dust:
        from the sky shall it come down on you, until you are destroyed.
028:025 Yahweh will cause you to be struck before your enemies;
        you shall go out one way against them, and shall flee seven
        ways before them:  and you shall be tossed back and forth
        among all the kingdoms of the earth.
028:026 Your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky,
        and to the animals of the earth; and there shall be none
        to frighten them away.
028:027 Yahweh will strike you with the boil of Egypt, and with the tumors,
        and with the scurvy, and with the itch, of which you can
        not be healed.
028:028 Yahweh will strike you with madness, and with blindness,
        and with astonishment of heart;
028:029 and you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes
        in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways:
        and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always, and there
        shall be none to save you.
028:030 You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her:
        you shall build a house, and you shall not dwell therein:
        you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not use the fruit of it.
028:031 Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall
        not eat of it:  your donkey shall be violently taken away
        from before your face, and shall not be restored to you:
        your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall
        have none to save you.
028:032 Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people;
        and your eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all
        the day:  and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand.
028:033 The fruit of your ground, and all your labors, shall a nation
        which you don't know eat up; and you shall be only oppressed
        and crushed always;
028:034 so that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which
        you shall see.
028:035 Yahweh will strike you in the knees, and in the legs,
        with a sore boil, of which you can not be healed, from the sole
        of your foot to the crown of your head.
028:036 Yahweh will bring you, and your king whom you shall set over you,
        to a nation that you have not known, you nor your fathers;
        and there shall you serve other gods, wood and stone.
028:037 You shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword,
        among all the peoples where Yahweh shall lead you away.
028:038 You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather
        little in; for the locust shall consume it.
028:039 You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall
        neither drink of the wine, nor gather [the grapes];
        for the worm shall eat them.
028:040 You shall have olive trees throughout all your borders,
        but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olive
        shall cast [its fruit].
028:041 You shall father sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours;
        for they shall go into captivity.
028:042 All your trees and the fruit of your ground shall the locust possess.
028:043 The foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above
        you higher and higher; and you shall come down lower and lower.
028:044 He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him:
        he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.
028:045 All these curses shall come on you, and shall pursue you,
        and overtake you, until you are destroyed; because you didn't
        listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his commandments
        and his statutes which he commanded you:
028:046 and they shall be on you for a sign and for a wonder,
        and on your seed forever.
028:047 Because you didn't serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness,
        and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance
        of all things;
028:048 therefore shall you serve your enemies whom Yahweh shall send
        against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness,
        and in want of all things:  and he shall put a yoke of iron
        on your neck, until he have destroyed you.
028:049 Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far, from the end
        of the earth, as the eagle flies; a nation whose language
        you shall not understand;
028:050 a nation of fierce facial expressions, that shall not regard
        the person of the old, nor show favor to the young,
028:051 and shall eat the fruit of your livestock, and the fruit of
        your ground, until you are destroyed; that also shall not leave
        you grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of your livestock,
        or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.
028:052 They shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high
        and fortified walls come down, in which you trusted,
        throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you in all
        your gates throughout all your land, which Yahweh your God
        has given you.
028:053 You shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons
        and of your daughters, whom Yahweh your God has given you,
        in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies
        shall distress you.
028:054 The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall
        be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom,
        and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining;
028:055 so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his
        children whom he shall eat, because he has nothing left him,
        in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall
        distress you in all your gates.
028:056 The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure
        to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness
        and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband
        of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,
028:057 and toward her young one who comes out from between her feet,
        and toward her children whom she shall bear; for she shall
        eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege
        and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you
        in your gates.
028:058 If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that
        are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious
        and fearful name, YAHWEH YOUR GOD;
028:059 then Yahweh will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues
        of your seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance,
        and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.
028:060 He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt,
        which you were afraid of; and they shall cleave to you.
028:061 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written
        in the book of this law, them will Yahweh bring on you,
        until you are destroyed.
028:062 You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars
        of the sky for multitude; because you didn't listen to the voice
        of Yahweh your God.
028:063 It shall happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good,
        and to multiply you, so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause
        you to perish, and to destroy you; and you shall be plucked
        from off the land where you go in to possess it.
028:064 Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples, from the one
        end of the earth even to the other end of the earth;
        and there you shall serve other gods, which you have not known,
        you nor your fathers, even wood and stone.
028:065 Among these nations shall you find no ease, and there
        shall be no rest for the sole of your foot:  but Yahweh
        will give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes,
        and pining of soul;
028:066 and your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall
        fear night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life.
028:067 In the morning you shall say, Would it were even! and at even
        you shall say, Would it were morning! for the fear of your
        heart which you shall fear, and for the sight of your eyes
        which you shall see.
028:068 Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way
        of which I said to you, You shall see it no more again:
        and there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for
        bondservants and for bondmaids, and no man shall buy you.
029:001 These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded
        Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab,
        besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
029:002 Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, You have seen
        all that Yahweh did before your eyes in the land of Egypt
        to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
029:003 the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs,
        and those great wonders:
029:004 but Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see,
        and ears to hear, to this day.
029:005 I have led you forty years in the wilderness:  your clothes
        have not grown old on you, and your shoe has not grown old
        on your foot.
029:006 You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink;
        that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.
029:007 When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon,
        and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle,
        and we struck them:
029:008 and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance
        to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe
        of the Manassites.
029:009 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them,
        that you may prosper in all that you do.
029:010 You stand this day all of you before Yahweh your God;
        your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers,
        even all the men of Israel,
029:011 your little ones, your wives, and your foreigner who is
        in the midst of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood
        to the one who draws your water;
029:012 that you may enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God,
        and into his oath, which Yahweh your God makes with you this day;
029:013 that he may establish you this day to himself for a people,
        and that he may be to you a God, as he spoke to you,
        and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,
        and to Jacob.
029:014 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,
029:015 but with him who stands here with us this day before Yahweh
        our God, and also with him who is not here with us this day
029:016 (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came
        through the midst of the nations through which you passed;
029:017 and you have seen their abominations, and their idols,
        wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);
029:018 lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family,
        or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from Yahweh our God,
        to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should
        be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;
029:019 and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse,
        that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace,
        though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy
        the moist with the dry.
029:020 Yahweh will not pardon him, but then the anger of Yahweh
        and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all
        the curse that is written in this book shall lie on him,
        and Yahweh will blot out his name from under the sky.
029:021 Yahweh will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel,
        according to all the curses of the covenant that is written
        in this book of the law.
029:022 The generation to come, your children who shall rise up after you,
        and the foreigner who shall come from a far land, shall say,
        when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses
        with which Yahweh has made it sick;
029:023 [and that] the whole land of it is sulfur, and salt, [and] a burning,
        [that] it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein,
        like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim,
        which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:
029:024 even all the nations shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus
        to this land? what means the heat of this great anger?
029:025 Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Yahweh,
        the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought
        them forth out of the land of Egypt,
029:026 and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that
        they didn't know, and that he had not given to them:
029:027 therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against this land,
        to bring on it all the curse that is written in this book;
029:028 and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath,
        and in great indignation, and cast them into another land,
        as at this day.
029:029 The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things
        that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever,
        that we may do all the words of this law.
030:001 It shall happen, when all these things are come on you,
        the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you,
        and you shall call them to mind among all the nations,
        where Yahweh your God has driven you,
030:002 and shall return to Yahweh your God, and shall obey his voice
        according to all that I command you this day, you and your children,
        with all your heart, and with all your soul;
030:003 that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity, and have
        compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all
        the peoples, where Yahweh your God has scattered you.
030:004 If [any of] your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of
        the heavens, from there will Yahweh your God gather you,
        and from there he will bring you back:
030:005 and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your
        fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and he will do
        you good, and multiply you above your fathers.
030:006 Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart
        of your seed, to love Yahweh your God with all your heart,
        and with all your soul, that you may live.
030:007 Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies,
        and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.
030:008 You shall return and obey the voice of Yahweh, and do all his
        commandments which I command you this day.
030:009 Yahweh your God will make you plenteous in all the work
        of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit
        of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good:
        for Yahweh will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced
        over your fathers;
030:010 if you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his
        commandments and his statutes which are written in this book
        of the law; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart,
        and with all your soul.
030:011 For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not
        too hard for you, neither is it far off.
030:012 It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up
        for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it,
        that we may do it?
030:013 Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who shall go
        over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it,
        that we may do it?
030:014 But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart,
        that you may do it.
030:015 Behold, I have set before you this day life and good,
        and death and evil;
030:016 in that I command you this day to love Yahweh your God,
        to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his
        statutes and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply,
        and that Yahweh your God may bless you in the land where you
        go in to possess it.
030:017 But if your heart turn away, and you will not hear, but shall
        be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
030:018 I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish;
        you shall not prolong your days in the land, where you pass
        over the Jordan to go in to possess it.
030:019 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I
        have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse:
        therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed;
030:020 to love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cleave to him;
        for he is your life, and the length of your days; that you
        may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,
        to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.
031:001 Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
031:002 He said to them, I am one hundred twenty years old this day;
        I can no more go out and come in:  and Yahweh has said to me,
        You shall not go over this Jordan.
031:003 Yahweh your God, he will go over before you; he will destroy
        these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them:
        [and] Joshua, he shall go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
031:004 Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings
        of the Amorites, and to their land; whom he destroyed.
031:005 Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them
        according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.
031:006 Be strong and of good courage, don't be afraid, nor be scared
        of them:  for Yahweh your God, he it is who does go with you;
        he will not fail you, nor forsake you.
031:007 Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of
        all Israel, Be strong and of good courage:  for you shall
        go with this people into the land which Yahweh has sworn
        to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them
        to inherit it.
031:008 Yahweh, he it is who does go before you; he will be with you,
        he will not fail you, neither forsake you:  don't be afraid,
        neither be dismayed.
031:009 Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons
        of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
        and to all the elders of Israel.
031:010 Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of [every] seven years,
        in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tents,
031:011 when all Israel is come to appear before Yahweh your God
        in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law
        before all Israel in their hearing.
031:012 Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones,
        and your foreigner who is within your gates, that they
        may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your God,
        and observe to do all the words of this law;
031:013 and that their children, who have not known, may hear,
        and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as you live
        in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.
031:014 Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, your days approach that you must die:
        call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting,
        that I may give him a charge.  Moses and Joshua went,
        and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
031:015 Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud:
        and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.
031:016 Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers;
        and this people will rise up, and play the prostitute after
        the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them,
        and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have
        made with them.
031:017 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day,
        and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them,
        and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles
        shall come on them; so that they will say in that day,
        Haven't these evils come on us because our God is not among us?
031:018 I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they
        shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods.
031:019 Now therefore write you this song for you, and teach you it
        the children of Israel:  put it in their mouths, that this
        song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
031:020 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I
        swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey,
        and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat;
        then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me,
        and break my covenant.
031:021 It shall happen, when many evils and troubles are come on them,
        that this song shall testify before them as a witness;
        for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed:
        for I know their imagination which they frame this day,
        before I have brought them into the land which I swore.
031:022 So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it
        the children of Israel.
031:023 He gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said,
        Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring
        the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them:
        and I will be with you.
031:024 It happened, when Moses had made an end of writing the words
        of this law in a book, until they were finished,
031:025 that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant
        of Yahweh, saying,
031:026 Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark
        of the covenant of Yahweh your God, that it may be there
        for a witness against you.
031:027 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck:  behold, while I
        am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious
        against Yahweh; and how much more after my death?
031:028 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers,
        that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven
        and earth to witness against them.
031:029 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves,
        and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you;
        and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you
        will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke
        him to anger through the work of your hands.
031:030 Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words
        of this song, until they were finished.
032:001 Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak.  Let the earth hear
        the words of my mouth.
032:002 My doctrine shall drop as the rain.  My speech shall
        condense as the dew, as the small rain on the tender grass,
        as the showers on the herb.
032:003 For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh.  Ascribe greatness
        to our God!
032:004 The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice:
        a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he.
032:005 They have dealt corruptly with him, [they are] not
        his children, [it is] their blemish.  [They are] a perverse
        and crooked generation.
032:006 Do you thus requite Yahweh, foolish people and unwise?
        Isn't he your father who has bought you?  He has made you,
        and established you.
032:007 Remember the days of old.  Consider the years of many generations.
        Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they
        will tell you.
032:008 When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,
        when he separated the children of men, he set the bounds of
        the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.
032:009 For Yahweh's portion is his people.  Jacob is the lot
        of his inheritance.
032:010 He found him in a desert land, in the waste howling wilderness.
        He surrounded him.  He cared for him.  He kept him as the apple
        of his eye.
032:011 As an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young,
        he spread abroad his wings, he took them, he bore them
        on his feathers.
032:012 Yahweh alone led him.  There was no foreign god with him.
032:013 He made him ride on the high places of the earth.
        He ate the increase of the field.  He caused him to suck
        honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock;
032:014 Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of
        the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat.
        Of the blood of the grape you drank wine.
032:015 But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked.  You have grown fat.
        You have grown thick.  You have become sleek.
        Then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock
        of his salvation.
032:016 They moved him to jealousy with strange [gods]. They provoked
        him to anger with abominations.
032:017 They sacrificed to demons, [which were] no God, to gods
        that they didn't know, to new [gods] that came up of late,
        which your fathers didn't dread.
032:018 Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful,
        and have forgotten God who gave you birth.
032:019 Yahweh saw [it], and abhorred [them], because of the provocation
        of his sons and his daughters.
032:020 He said, I will hide my face from them.  I will see what their
        end shall be; for they are a very perverse generation,
        children in whom is no faithfulness.
032:021 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God.
        They have provoked me to anger with their vanities.
        I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people.
        I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
032:022 For a fire is kindled in my anger, Burns to the lowest
        Sheol, Devours the earth with its increase, and sets
        the foundations of the mountains on fire.
032:023 I will heap evils on them.  I will spend my arrows on them.
032:024 [They shall be] wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning
        heat and bitter destruction.  I will send the teeth of animals
        on them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.
032:025 Outside the sword shall bereave, and in the chambers, terror; on both
        young man and virgin, The suckling with the gray-haired man.
032:026 I said, I would scatter them afar.  I would make the memory
        of them to cease from among men;
032:027 were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,
        lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they should say,
        Our hand is exalted, Yahweh has not done all this.
032:028 For they are a nation void of counsel.  There is no
        understanding in them.
032:029 Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
        would consider their latter end!
032:030 How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand
        to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and Yahweh had
        delivered them up?
032:031 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies
        themselves being judges.
032:032 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah.
        Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter.
032:033 Their wine is the poison of serpents, The cruel venom of asps.
032:034 Isn't this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures?
032:035 Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the time when their
        foot slides; for the day of their calamity is at hand.
        The things that are to come on them shall make haste.
032:036 For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion
        on his servants, when he sees that [their] power is gone,
        There is none [remaining], shut up or left at large.
032:037 He will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which
        they took refuge;
032:038 Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine
        of their drink offering?  Let them rise up and help you!
        Let them be your protection.
032:039 See now that I, even I, am he, There is no god with me.
        I kill, and I make alive.  I wound, and I heal.
        There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.
032:040 For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever,
032:041 if I whet my glittering sword, My hand take hold on judgment;
        I will render vengeance to my adversaries, and will recompense
        those who hate me.
032:042 I will make my arrows drunk with blood.  My sword shall
        devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives,
        from the head of the leaders of the enemy.
032:043 Rejoice, you nations, [with] his people, for he will avenge
        the blood of his servants.  He will render vengeance
        to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land,
        for his people.
032:044 Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears
        of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.
032:045 Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
032:046 He said to them, Set your heart to all the words which I
        testify to you this day, which you shall command your children
        to observe to do, [even] all the words of this law.
032:047 For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life,
        and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land,
        where you go over the Jordan to possess it.
032:048 Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,
032:049 Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo,
        which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho;
        and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children
        of Israel for a possession;
032:050 and die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered
        to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor,
        and was gathered to his people:
032:051 because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children
        of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness
        of Zin; because you didn't sanctify me in the midst of
        the children of Israel.
032:052 For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go
        there into the land which I give the children of Israel.
033:001 This is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed
        the children of Israel before his death.
033:002 He said, Yahweh came from Sinai, And rose from Seir to them.
        He shone forth from Mount Paran.  He came from the ten thousands
        of holy ones.  At his right hand was a fiery law for them.
033:003 Yes, he loves the people.  All his saints are in your hand.
        They sat down at your feet; [Everyone] shall receive
        of your words.
033:004 Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
033:005 He was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered,
        All the tribes of Israel together.
033:006 Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few.
033:007 This is [the blessing] of Judah:  and he said, Hear, Yahweh,
        the voice of Judah.  Bring him in to his people.
        With his hands he contended for himself.  You shall be a help
        against his adversaries.
033:008 Of Levi he said, Your Thummim and your Urim are with your
        godly one, whom you proved at Massah, with whom you strove
        at the waters of Meribah;
033:009 who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him;
        Neither did he acknowledge his brothers, Nor did he know
        his own children:  For they have observed your word,
        and keep your covenant.
033:010 They shall teach Jacob your ordinances, and Israel your law.
        They shall put incense before you, and whole burnt offering
        on your altar.
033:011 Yahweh, bless his substance.  Accept the work of his hands.
        Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him,
        of those who hate him, that they not rise again.
033:012 Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell
        in safety by him.  He covers him all the day long.
        He dwells between his shoulders.
033:013 Of Joseph he said, His land is blessed by Yahweh, for the
        precious things of the heavens, for the dew, for the deep
        that couches beneath,
033:014 for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, for the precious
        things of the growth of the moons,
033:015 for the chief things of the ancient mountains, for the precious
        things of the everlasting hills,
033:016 for the precious things of the earth and its fullness,
        the good will of him who lived in the bush{i. e.
        the burning bush of Exodus 3:3-4.}. Let [the blessing] come
        on the head of Joseph, On the crown of the head of him who was
        separate from his brothers.
033:017 The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his.  His horns are
        the horns of the wild ox.  With them he shall push the peoples
        all of them, [even] the ends of the earth:  They are the ten
        thousands of Ephraim.  They are the thousands of Manasseh.
033:018 Of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;
        and Issachar, in your tents.
033:019 They shall call the peoples to the mountain.  There they will
        offer sacrifices of righteousness, for they shall draw out
        the abundance of the seas, the hidden treasures of the sand.
033:020 Of Gad he said, He who enlarges Gad is blessed.
        He dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm, yes, the crown
        of the head.
033:021 He provided the first part for himself, for there was the lawgiver's
        portion reserved.  He came [with] the heads of the people.
        He executed the righteousness of Yahweh, His ordinances with Israel.
033:022 Of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's cub that leaps out of Bashan.
033:023 Of Naphtali he said, Naphtali, satisfied with favor, full of
        the blessing of Yahweh, Possess the west and the south.
033:024 Of Asher he said, Asher is blessed with children.
        Let him be acceptable to his brothers.  Let him dip his
        foot in oil.
033:025 Your bars shall be iron and brass.  As your days, so shall
        your strength be.
033:026 There is none like God, Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens
        for your help, In his excellency on the skies.
033:027 The eternal God is [your] dwelling place.  Underneath are
        the everlasting arms.  He thrust out the enemy from before you,
        and said, Destroy.
033:028 Israel dwells in safety; the fountain of Jacob alone, In a land
        of grain and new wine.  Yes, his heavens drop down dew.
033:029 You are happy, Israel.  Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh,
        the shield of your help, the sword of your excellency!
        Your enemies shall submit themselves to you.  You shall tread
        on their high places.
034:001 Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo,
        to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho.
        Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,
034:002 and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh,
        and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea,
034:003 and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city
        of palm trees, to Zoar.
034:004 Yahweh said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham,
        to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed:
        I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall
        not go over there.
034:005 So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab,
        according to the word of Yahweh.
034:006 He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against
        Beth Peor:  but no man knows of his tomb to this day.
034:007 Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died:
        his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
034:008 The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab
        thirty days:  so the days of weeping in the mourning for
        Moses were ended.
034:009 Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;
        for Moses had laid his hands on him:  and the children of Israel
        listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
034:010 There has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses,
        whom Yahweh knew face to face,
034:011 in all the signs and the wonders, which Yahweh sent him to do
        in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
        and to all his land,
034:012 and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror,
        which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05

Or /etext04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92,
91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
