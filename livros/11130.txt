PREFACE.



This little Manual was originally prepared for the NORMAL CLASS, at
the request of the editor of that Journal, and was at the same time
expected to form an instruction book at the Sunday-School Assembly
annually held at Chautauqua. This accounts for its form in twelve
series of two pages each.  The reading lessons, however, have been
made sufficiently full for subsequent study. Of course the simplest
elements only of the Greek language can be comprised in such narrow
limits; nor can a full vocabulary or ready facility be acquired in so
short a course. Nevertheless, a good beginning may be made, and that
is "half the battle" in any enterprise. It is believed that a thorough
mastery of this small volume will prove a conquest over all the real
difficulties of the original tongue of the New Testament.

§ 2. Notes on the Alphabet.


1. α sounds broad, like _a_ in _arm_, at the end of a word,
and before ρ final or ρ followed by a different consonant.

2. γ has the nasal sound, like _ng_ in _king_, before γ,
κ, χ, or ξ.

3. ι has its long sound, like _i_ in _machine_, at the end
of a syllable.

Every letter is sounded, and, with the above exceptions, invariably
the same.



2. ACCENT.


§ 3. Each word, except a very few monosyllables, has one of the
following accents written over a vowel in it, which marks the place of
the spoken tone. A few small words, called _enclitics_, generally
throw their accent, as an acute, on the last syllable of the preceding
word.

§ 4. The _acute_ ('), which is the foundation of all the
accents, stands on one of the last three syllables. In verbs, with the
exception of certain forms, it stands as far toward the beginning of
the word as the rules below allow. In other parts of speech it stands
on the same syllable as in the ground-form, (that given in the
lexicon,) except as required by these rules. When the last syllable
has a long vowel or diphthong it stands on the syllable before the
last.

§ 5. The _grave_ accent (`) is only written in place of the
acute on the last syllable when not before a pause, or when
unemphatic.  It is understood to belong to all other syllables.

§ 6. The _circumflex_ (~) is placed on a syllable formed by
the combination of two, the first of which had an acute and the second
a grave; hence only on the last, or next to the last syllable, and
only on a long vowel or a diphthong. When the last syllable has a
short vowel, such a penult, if accented, takes the circumflex.



3. BREATHINGS, VOWELS, DIPHTHONGS, ETC.


§ 7. A vowel beginning a word takes either the _rough
breathing_, (῾), which is pronounced like _h_, or else, to
show the absence of that, _the smooth breathing_, (᾿), which
has no appreciable sound. Initial ρ and υ always take the rough
breathing; and double ρ in the middle of a word takes the smooth
breathing on the first, and the rough on the second.

§ 8. The vowels are short, (ε and ο,) long, (η and ω,) or
doubtful, (α, ι, and υ,) which last, although naturally short, are
sometimes lengthened by derivation.

§ 9. The diphthongs are as follows:--

   Proper.          With Iota Subscript.           Improper.
αι sounds ay             ᾳ = α                   ηυ = η and υ
ει    "    i             ῃ = η                   ωυ = ω and υ
οι    "   oy             ῳ = ω
υι    "   we
αυ    "   ow
ευ    "   yu
ου    "   oo

§ 10. In diphthongs the breathing and accent are written over the
_second_ vowel. A capital (initial) letter in other cases takes
them _before_ it.

§ 11. The punctuation marks are the comma, (,), the semicolon, (·),
the period, (.), and the interrogation point, (;).



LESSON   II.

EUPHONIC CHANGES.


§ 12. When two _consonants_ come together the first is made
homogeneous with the second, as follows:--

§ 13. Mutes of a different class must have the same degree of
hardness according to the following classification:--

                         Smooth.      Middle.   Rough.    Sibilant (with _s_.)
Kappa-mutes.               κ            γ         χ            ξ
Pi-mutes                   π            β         φ            ψ
Tau-mutes                  τ            δ         ϑ            ζ

§ 14. A _smooth_ final mute is roughened before a vowel with the
rough breathing. A rough mute is not doubled, nor can successive
syllables begin with an aspirate. A tau-mute is sometimes dropped
before σ, and always before κ; before a different tau-mute it is
changed into σ.

§ 15. Before μ a kappa-mute is changed into γ, a pi-mute into μ,
and a tau-mute into σ.

§ 16. ν before a kappa-mute becomes γ, before a pi-mute μ, before
a liquid (λ, μ, ν, or ρ) it is changed into the same liquid,
before σ or ζ it is dropped.

§ 17. ν is appended to certain endings in σι or ε before a pause
or a vowel.

§ 18. There are several other less important rules, and some
exceptions to most of the above.

§ 19. A _long vowel_ or _diphthong_ is used as an
equivalent for two (usually short) vowels in immediate succession, or
as a compensation for the omission of a consonant, sometimes for both.

§ 20. The changes in the union of two vowels are various, depending
upon their comparative strength, position, and relation to the long
vowels, or diphthongs respectively. They are readily learned by
practice.

§ 21. Compensation is not always thus made for the omission of a
consonant. Sometimes the omission occurs too far back in the
derivation to be easily traced.

§ 22. A final vowel is sometimes elided before another vowel, and its
place indicated by the apostrophe, (').

§ 23. There are several _dialects_, which chiefly affect the
vowels, (like provincial pronunciation;) but in later Greek (to which
the New Testament belongs) they were merged in "the common dialect,"
the Attic pre-dominating.


NOUNS.

Nouns are of three declensions, three genders, three numbers, and five
cases, all indicated by changes of termination.

§ 24. The declensions (numbered 1, 2, and 3) are only different modes
of inflection.

§ 25. Names and designations of males, nations, the months, rivers,
and winds, are almost invariably _masculine_; those of females,
countries, islands, cities, trees, and plants, are usually
_feminine_; of the _neuter_ gender are most names of fruits
and diminutives, and always the names of the letters, infinitives,
clauses, indeclinable words, and words used as the symbol of a
sound. In the third declension especially the (grammatical) gender in
many instances is arbitrary.

§ 26. The _singular_ and _plural_ are used as in
English. The _dual_ denotes two or a pair; it is comparatively
rare, and never occurs in the New Testament.

§ 27. The _cases_ express the relations of words to each other
in a sentence, as follows:--

   Name.                   Use.                        Equivalent.
Nominative.       Subject of a finite verb.        (Simple form.)
Genitive.         Origin or ownership.             _From, of,_ etc.
Dative.           Position or manner.              _In, by, for, to,_ etc.
Accusative.       Direction or object.             _Toward, into,_ etc.
Vocative.         Address.                         _O!_

§ 28. The following are the terminations of the _First
Declension_:--

   Singular.                        Cases.                      Plural.
  _Masc._      _Fem._                                     _Masc. and Fem._
ας or ης      α  or η           Nominative.                       αι
   ον         ας or ης          Genitive.                         ῶν
         ᾳ  or η                Dative.                           αις
         αν or ην               Accusative.                       ας
         α  or η                Vocative.                         αι

  _Dual._ Nom., Acc., Voc., α; Gen., Dat., αιν.

§ 29. The α in the terminations of the singular is mostly used when
ρ, ε,or ι precedes it; and in the Nom., Acc., and Voc. when λ or
σ, and frequently when ν, precedes it. A few nouns have α in the
Gen. sing.



LESSON   III.

NOUNS--Continued.

§ 30. The following are the terminations of the _Second
Declension_:--

   Singular.                      Cases.                   Plural.
  _Masc._     _Neut._                                     _Masc._     _Neut._
     ος        ον                Nominative.                οι           α
         ου                      Genitive.                        ων
         ῳ                       Dative.                          οις
         ον                      Accusative.                ους          α
     ε         ον                Vocative.                  οι           α

  _Dual._ Nom., Acc., Voc., ω; Gen., Dat., οιν.

§ 31. The few fem. nouns of this declension take the
masc. terminations. The Voc. masc. sing. is occasionally ος.

§ 32. The following are the terminations of the _Third Declension_:--

   Singular.                                      Cases.                   Plural.
  _Masc. and Fem._         _Neut._                            _Masc. and Fem._         _Neut._
ς (or long vowel         (naked stem.)        Nominative.             ες                 α
before final letter.)
                      ος                      Genitive.                          ων
                      ι                       Dative.                            σι(ν)
     ν or α              (naked stem.)        Accusative.             ας                 α
(like Nom. or Neut.)     (naked stem.)        Vocative.               ες                 α

  _Dual._ Nom., Acc., Voc., ε; Gen., Dat., οιν.

§ 33. The Nom. sing. is so often changed by the euphonic rules that
the stem of the noun is best seen in the Gen. Nouns in ις, υς, and
ευς take the (Attic) Gen. εως, (ω regarded as _short_.)
The α of the Acc. sing. is usually after a consonant. Many
irregularities and some anomalies occur, which may generally be
learned from the lexicon.


ADJECTIVES.

§ 34. These are _declined_ like nouns, having sometimes three
sets of terminations for the respective genders, sometimes two, (masc.
and fem. alike,) rarely but one, (all genders alike.) The masc. and
neut. are always of the same declension, (second or third,) and the
fem., when different, always of the first. _Participles_ are
declined like adjectives.

§ 35. Adjectives are _compared_ either by using an adverb
expressive of degree, or, more regularly, by adding to the stem of the
positive the syllables ότερος or ίων for the comparative, and
ότατος or ιστος for the superlative. Some euphonic changes
occur in making these additions, which then take the regular
declensional endings.


NUMERALS.

§ 36. The _cardinal_ numbers are either simple, (the units,
tens, and a few others,) or compound, (intermediate numbers.) Those
from one to four inclusive, and the hundreds and thousands, are
declined like adjectives. They may all be learned from the lexicon.

§ 37. The _ordinals_ are mostly formed from the cardinals by
adjective endings.


PRONOUNS.

§ 38. Of the _personal_ pronouns, those of the 1st and 2d
persons only are specially noteworthy, being declined as nouns
irregularly:--

              _I_ or _Me_.  _We_ or _Us_.  _Thou_ or _Thee_.  _Ye_ or _You_.
Nominative.      ἐγώ            ἡμεῖς             σύ              ὑμεῖς
Genitive.       (ἐ)μοῦ          ἡμῶν              σοῦ             ὑμῶν
Dative.         (ἐ)μοί          ἡμῖν              σοί             ὑμῖν
Accusative.     (ἐ)μέ           ἡμᾶς              σέ              ὑμᾶς

§ 39. The rest are declined as adjectives--masc. ος, fem, η,
neut. ο; often compounded, one or both parts being declined; but,
with the exception of τις, (interrogative τίς, indefinite
τὶς,) neut. τι, Gen. τινος, of the third declension, the
_article_ (definite only) and the _demonstrative_ alone are
very peculiar in declension, as follows:--

   Singular.                 The.                Plural.
  _Masc.  Neut.  Fem._                     _Masc.  Neut.  Fem._
   ὁ       τό    ἡ         Nominative.      οἱ     τά     αἱ
       τοῦ       τῆς       Genitive.           τῶν    τῶν
       τῷ        τῇ        Dative.             τοῖς   ταῖς
   τόν     τό    τήν       Accusative.      -ούς    τά    τάς

  _Dual._ Nom., Acc., Voc., τώ, τά; Gen., Dat., τοῖν, ταῖν.

   Singular.              This, These.            Plural.
_Masc.  Neut.  Fem._                        _Masc.   Neut.  Fem._
οὗτος  τοῦτο  αὕτη        Nominative.        οὗτοι   ταῦτα  αὗται
   τούτου     ταύτης      Genitive.             τούτων      τούτων
   τούτῳ      -αύτῃ       Dative.               τούτοις     ταύταις
τουτου τοῦτο  ταυτην      Accusative.        τούτους ταῦτα  ταύτας

  _Dual._ Nom., Acc., Voc., τούτω, ταῦτα; Gen., Dat., τούτοιν, ταύταιν



LESSON IV.

VERBS.


§ 40. There are three VOICES, _Active, Middle,_ and
_Passive,_ generally distinguished by the _termination_.

The Middle is properly _reflexive_. Some of its tenses have an
_active_ meaning. A few verbs, called _deponent_, are
throughout pass. in form, but act. or mid. in meaning.

§ 41. There are five MOODS in each voice, the _Indicative,
Imperative, Subjunctive, Optative,_ and _Infinitive_, to which
may be added the _Participles_; they are mostly known by means of
the _union-vowel_--that which immediately precedes the
termination.

§ 42. The Indic., Imper., Infin., and Participles correspond to the
English, and have a _short_ union-vowel, (ε, ο, or α,) except
the Perf. and Pluperf. pass., which have no union-vowel; the
Pluperf. act. and mid., which have ει; and the Aorists pass., which
have η or its equivalent.

§ 43. The Imper. has but two persons. 2d and 3d. The Infin. has but
one termination for all numbers and persons, and is very often used as
a neut. noun, with the article, etc., yet retaining its construction
as a verb.

§ 44. The Subj. and Opt. are used in certain _dependent_
relations, like the English subjunctive and potential; the former has
a _long_ union-vowel, (η or ω,) and the latter a diphthong,
(οι, αι, or ει.) The former generally represents an act as
contingent upon outward circumstances, and the latter upon a will.

§ 45. The TENSES are nine, the _Present, Imperfect, Perfect,
Pluperfect,_ two _Aorists_, (1st and 2d, equivalent in sense,)
and three _Futures_, (1st and 2d, equivalent to each other, and
3d, very rarely used;) they are distinguished by certain letters
prefixed, inserted, or added to the stem or root of the verb. They
represent time as compared with the _present_, and never date
from that of a preceding verb.

§ 46. The Pres., Perf., Pluperf., and Fut. answer very nearly to the
same tenses in English.

§ 47. The Imperf. denotes an act as going on, but incomplete or
habitual at some time past: "was doing," etc.

§ 48. The Aorists indicate a single act at a definite time, (past in
the Indic., but undetermined in the others moods.)

§ 49. All the tenses with respect to form may be classed thus:--

I. _Primary_, or Absolute.  Present. Perfect. Futures.

II. _Secondary_, or Historical. Imperfect. Pluperfect. Aorists.

These classes usually have the following endings respectively:--

         Active Form.                Persons.           Middle and Passive.
      I.              II.                                   I.       II.
Pres. and Fut.   Perf.  Opt.          Sing.
      ο           -   ν  μι            1st                 μαι       μην
      ις              ς                2d                  σαι      (σ)ο
      ι               -                3d                  ται       το
                                      Plur.
                     μεν               1st                     μεϑα
                     τε                2d                      σϑε
      (ντ) σι (ν)      (σα)ν           3d                  νται      ντο
[2d, τον, 3d, την.   Dual. 1st, μεϑον, 2d, σϑον, 3d, σϑην.]

_Notes on the Table of Verb Endings._

§ 50. In the Pres. and Fut. the ο of the 1st sing. act. is
contracted (with the union-vowel) into ω, and the σαι of the 2d
sing. pass.  into ῃ or ει.

§ 51. Signification limits the primary terminations to the Indic. and
Subj., and the secondary to the Indic. and Opt.: likewise the
Imperf. and Pluperf. to the Indic., and the Imper. to the Pres., the
Aorists and (rarely) the Perf.

§ 52. The _active_ terminations are assumed throughout by the
Perf. and Pluperf. mid., and the Aorists pass.

§ 53. The terminations of the Imper. are analogous to the secondary
in the act., and in the mid. and pass. they are merely the same
strengthened, thus: _Sing._ 2d,--[Aor. pass, ϑι, 1st
Aor. act. (σ)ov] (pass. ο [1st Aor. mid. ι] or σο); 3d, τω
(pass. σϑω,) _Plur._ 2d, τε (pass. σϑε); 3d, τωσαν
[or contr. ντων] (pass, σϑωσαν. [_Dual._ 2d, τον
(σϑον); 3d, των (σϑων,)]

§ 54. The Infin. in the act. forms ends in εν, [contr., with
union-vowel into ειν] (Pres., Fut., and 2d Aor.,) αι, (1st Aor.,)
or ναι, (Perf. act. and mid. and both Aor. pass.;) elsewhere in
σϑαι.

§ 55. In the Participles the stem ends in ντ in the act. forms,
(except the Perf. act. and mid., which have ότ;) the rest take
μεν, (Perf. pass, μέν.) These latter are [masc. and neut.] of
the second declension, the others of the third.

§ 56. Verbs in μι insert σ before the final ι of the 3d
pers. sing. Pres. Indic. act., and vary in a few other terminations,
chiefly by contraction.



LESSON  V.

VERBS--Continued.


§ 57. The root of every _primitive_ verb is a monosyllable,
consisting of a short vowel (α, ε, ι, ο, or υ) between two
(usually simple) consonants. Sometimes one or the other of the latter
has been dropped far back in the etymology. This root is most readily
found in the 1st Fut., subject only to euphonic changes. The 2d
Aor. always has a monosyllabic root, with a single vowel never long;
but this may be somewhat different from the true root. Primitive verbs
only have a 2d Aor.

§ 58. The Pres. and Imperf. commonly _strengthen_ the root,
either by adding a hard consonant, (sometimes more than one,) or
(oftener) by changing the root vowel into the corresponding long one
or diphthong.

§ 59. The following tenses add certain _characteristic_ letters
to the root:--

    1st Fut. and 1st Aor. act. and mid.,
        (of verbs not liquid,) and 3d Fut.                   ο
    1st Aor. pass.                                           ϑ
    1st Fut. pass.                                           ϑησ
    2d Fut. pass.                                            ηο
    2d (in liquid verbs 1st) Fut. act. and mid.              ε
    Perf. and Pluperf. Act. of pure and liquid verbs         κ
    Perf. and pluperf. act. ending in a pi- or kappa-mute    (῾)

§ 60. Tenses expressing _past time_ (Imperf. and Aorists Indic.)
prefix ε ("syllabic _augment") to the root; this coalesces with
an initial vowel ("temporal augment") into the corresponding long
vowel or diphthong. The Perf., Pluperf., and 3d Fut. not only do the
same throughout the moods, but also prefix to the _syllabic_
augment the initial consonant of the root ("reduplication") when this
is a simple consonant or a mute followed by a liquid. The
Pluperf. prefixes a second syllabic augment to the reduplication.

§ 61. Initial ρ, (which is doubled after the syllabic augment,)
βλ, γλ, and γν, do not, except in a few cases, allow the
reduplication.  Verbs compounded with a preposition generally take the
augment, etc., between it and the primitive. A few other
irregularities occur.

§ 62. Verbs are classified in conjugation according to the radical
letter following the root vowel, or diphthong, in the 1st pers. sing.
Pres. Indic. act., lexicon form: in "liquid" verbs (not derivatives in
άνω, which is merely strengthened for άω) this is a
_liquid_; in "pure" verbs it is absent, so that the root appears
to end in a vowel, etc. Very many verbs seem to be anomalous in some
of their forms in consequence of deriving these from an obsolete
kindred root. The lexicon gives most of these peculiarities.

§ 63. _Liquid_ verbs almost always strengthen their root in the
Pres. and Imperf.; they lengthen it in the 1st Aor. act. and mid. by
changing the root vowel, if α into η, if ε into ει, while ι and
ν merely become long. ε as a root vowel is generally changed into α
in the 1st Aor. and 1st Fut. pass., the Perf. and Pluperf. act. and
pass., and the 2d Aor. and 2d Fut. throughout, and again into ο in
the Perf.  and Pluperf. mid.

§ 64. The above strengthening in the Pres. and Imperf. consists in
doubling λ, annexing ν to μ; or, in case of ν or ρ, in adding ι
to a preceding α or ε, or lengthening ι or υ. The radical ν is
often dropped in Perf. and Pluperf.

§ 65. Verbs with ε followed by a pi- or kappa-mute in the root
frequently neglect to strengthen it in the Pres. and Imperf.; and
verbs with ε in the root preceded by a liquid, usually change it into
α and ο in the same tenses as liquid verbs, except in the 1st
Aor. and Fut.  pass.

§ 66. _Pure_ verbs lengthen the root vowel before a tense
characteristic, also in the Perf. and Pluperf. pass. A few
occasionally neglect this, and some insert σ instead.

§ 67. Verbs in μι (lexicon form instead of ω) are but another mode
of conjugating pure verbs (being the only primitives of that class
whose root ends in α, ε, or o) in the Pres., Imperf., and 2d Aor.;
in all which tenses the union-vowel coalesces with the root vowel.
They have a peculiar inflection, chiefly by reason of the Imperf. and
2d Aor. act. taking throughout the terminations of the Aorists
pass. The Pres. and Imperf. reduplicate with ι the initial consonant,
(prefixing simply ί if that cannot be done, and sometimes adopting
other modes of strengthening,) and in the act. they lengthen the root
in the Indic., α or ε into η, ο into ω. The 2d Aor. (those in
υμι being factitious have not this tense) has in the act. a long
vowel or diphthong throughout, except the Imperative ε or o, and the
Participle.


_Notes on Certain Verbs in μι._

§ 68. τίϑημι [_to put_] has, in the Act., 1st Aor. ἒϑηκα, Perf.
τέϑεικα; ὀίὀωμι [_to give_] has, 1st Aor., ἒδωκα.

§ 69. εἰμί [_to be_] is inflected thus: εὶ [_thou art_], ἐστί(ν)
[_is_], ἐσμέν, ἐστί, εἰσί(ν) [_we, ye, they are_], ἱσϑι [_be thou_],
ὤν [_being_], etc.; the rest mostly regular. See the lexicon
for these, and for ἵημι [_to send_], and εἰμι [_to go_].

§ 70. Several verbs annex σκω, ίνω, (ν)νυμι, etc., instead
of μι, etc., in the Pres. and Imperf.



LESSON VI.

SYNTAX.--CONCORD.


§ 71. All words placed under the same construction agree together in
all the accidents which they possess in common.

§ 72. "Apposition" occurs as in English.

§ 73. Adjectives agree with their nouns in gender, number, and case.

§ 74. The noun is often understood, especially if neut., ("things.")

§ 75. Sometimes a relative is "attracted" into the case of the
omitted antecedent.

§ 76. A verb agrees with its subject nominative in number and person.

§ 77. The case of the subject of the Infin. depends upon other
relations.

§ 78. Neuters plur. generally have a sing. verb.


GOVERNMENT.

§ 79. Any word may govern another (or others) which in sense is
_dependent_ upon it in the case appropriate for expressing such
relation either with or without a preposition.

     |                >>>---|----->                |
  Genitive.              Dative.              Accusative.

§ 80. GENITIVE, denoting _origin_, answering to _Whence?_
and expressed by _from_.

§ 81. "_Local_," involving _external_ relations of space,
either in a literal or a figurative sense. This includes actual
_motion_ from an object, generally with a preposition, (ἀπό
ἐκ παρά;) _separation_ from it, usually with verbs
compounded with a preposition; and _commencement_.

§ 82. "_Causal_," denoting a more _internal_ relation, as
if the outgoing of some agency or property, as follows:--

§ 83. _Active_, either direct, inferential, or
metaphysical. This includes relations of source, (e.g., derivation,
[commonly with ἐκ, sometimes ἀπό, direct authorship with
ὐπό,] possession, property, [often with an Infin.])
_partitive_ use, (e.g., a class, material, partial relations,)
and the Gen. of time, (in the _course_ of which,) especially the
"Gen. absolute," with a Participle, as affording occasion.

§ 84. _Passive_, that is, indirect, the act being for the sake
of the Gen. This includes verbs implying a _mental operation_,
adjectives, and other words denoting _skill_, and the Gen. of
_crime_ or _purpose_, (the last mostly an Infin. with the
article.)

§ 85. _Mutual_, e.g., _comparison_ and _price_ or _penalty_.

§ 86. The "attributive Gen." is a comprehensive relation, arising
under several of the above heads, between two nouns designating
_different_ objects, which may be thus expressed: _When two
nouns are connected with each other, that one which completes the idea
of the other and defines it more fully is put in the Gen._

§ 87. DATIVE, denoting _position_, answering to _Where?_
and expressed by _at_.

§ 88. "_Local_," involving the more palpable relations of
position. This includes the place, (at, by, near, in the midst of;
generally with ἐν, ἐπί, παρά, etc.,) _association,
accompaniment,_ (frequently with σύν,) and the _time_ (as a
date) or _circumstances_ of a transaction.

§ 89. "_Causal_," denoting the object _upon which_ the act
or state appears, thus conceived as sharing in producing it, as
follows:--

§ 90. _Personal_, either actually or so imagined. This includes
words expressing a _correlative_ idea, as community, (in varied
relations,) likeness, possession, agency, reference, etc.

§ 91. _Instrumental_, as the mediate cause, e.g., the ground or
reason, the means, the instrument, manner, and the measure of excess
or deficiency.

§ 92. In comprehensive phrase the "attributive Dat." expresses many
indirect relations of an object _to_ or _for_ which an act
is performed or a condition sustained.

§ 93. ACCUSATIVE, denoting _direction_, answering to
_Whither?_ and expressed by _toward_.

§ 94. "_Local_" involving the boundary, place, or object of
motion, especially with εἰς.

§ 95. "_Causal_," involving an influence, change, or result, as
impressed upon the object, as follows:--

§ 96. The _effect_, either the thing effected, an attribute of
the effect, or the effect intended.

§ 97. The _object acted upon_, e.g., with directly transitive
verbs, those expressing a good or bad influence, patience, swearing,
sometimes a mental affection, etc.; also the _space_ or
_way_ after a verb of motion; the time, (_throughout_
which,) measure, and weight; and finally ("Attributive Accusative")
with any verb or adj. (sometimes other words) to define its
application more closely, especially if of kindred signification.


ORDER OF WORDS IN A SENTENCE.

§ 98. This is usually not, as in English, that of _grammatical_
dependence, but rather the order of _thought_; important or
emphatic words come first, after the connecting particles;
prepositions and the article precede their nouns; and qualifying terms
are grouped in a harmonious balance around the principal ones.

  light in  the  darkness shines,   and  the darkness

  αὐτὸ32 οὐ33 κατέλαβεν.34
  it     not  admitted.

DIRECTIONS.--Spell the Greek, giving the _English_ equivalents of
the consonants, (as in § 1,) and the exact _phonetic_ value or
sound of the vowels. Call the rough breathing _h_. Be careful to
put the spoken _accent_ where it is written. Continue this
practice through all the passages given in the following lessons,
until the words can be pronounced readily and accurately. Familiarize
yourself with the forms of the letters by _writing_ them. Let the
pupil do this while learning the foregoing grammatical lessons, and
after the recitation of each of them let the teacher direct attention,
while the passage at the head of the reading lessons is pronounced, to
the examples illustrating each point, as they occur--by way of
paradigm.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
