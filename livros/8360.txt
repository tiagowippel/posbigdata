THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS

In this Epistle St. Paul admonishes the Thessalonians to be constant in
the faith of Christ and not to be terrified by the insinuations of false
teachers telling them that the day of judgment was near at hand, as
there must come many signs and wonders before it. He bids them to hold
firm the traditions received from him, whether by word, or by epistle,
and shews them how they may be certain of his letters by the manner he
writes.


2 Thessalonians Chapter 1

He gives thanks to God for their faith and constancy and prays for their
advancement in all good.

1:1. Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians.
In God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,

1:2. Grace unto you: and peace from God our Father and from the Lord
Jesus Christ.

1:3. We are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, as it
is fitting, because your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of
every one of you towards each other aboundeth.

1:4. So that we ourselves also glory in you in the churches of God, for
your patience and faith, and in all your persecutions and tribulations:
which you endure

1:5. For an example of the just judgment of God, that you may be counted
worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you suffer.

1:6. Seeing it is a just thing with God to repay tribulation to them
that trouble you:

1:7. And to you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus
shall be revealed from heaven with the angels of his power:

1:8. In a flame of fire, giving vengeance to them who know not God and
who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

1:9. Who shall suffer eternal punishment in destruction, from the face
of the Lord and from the glory of his power:

1:10. When he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be made
wonderful in all them who have believed; because our testimony was
believed upon you in that day.

1:11. Wherefore also we pray always for you: That our God would make you
worthy of his vocation and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness
and the work of faith in power:

1:12. That the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you
in him, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.

2 Thessalonians Chapter 2

The day of the Lord is not to come till the man of sin be revealed. The
apostle's traditions are to be observed.

2:1. And we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ and of our gathering together unto him:

2:2. That you be not easily moved from your sense nor be terrified,
neither by spirit nor by word nor by epistle as sent from us, as if the
day of the Lord were at hand.

2:3. Let no man deceive you by any means: for unless there come a revolt
first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition

A revolt... This revolt, or falling off, is generally understood, by the
ancient fathers, of a revolt from the Roman empire, which was first to
be destroyed, before the coming of Antichrist. It may, perhaps, be
understood also of a revolt of many nations from the Catholic Church;
which has, in part, happened already, by means of Mahomet, Luther, &c.,
and it may be supposed, will be more general in the days of the
Antichrist. The man of sin...  Here must be meant some particular man,
as is evident from the frequent repetition of the Greek article [ ], the
man of sin, the son of perdition, the adversary or opposer. It agrees to
the wicked and great Antichrist, who will come before the end of the
world.

2:4. Who opposeth and is lifted up above all that is called God or that
is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself
as if he were God.

In the temple... Either that of Jerusalem which some think he will
rebuild; or in some Christian church, which he will pervert to his own
worship: as Mahomet has done by the churches of the east.

2:5. Remember you not that, when I was yet with you, I told you these
things?

2:6. And now you know what withholdeth, that he may be revealed in his
time.

2:7. For the mystery of iniquity already worketh: only that he who now
holdeth do hold, until he be taken out of the way.

2:8. And then that wicked one shall be revealed: whom the Lord Jesus
shall kill with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the
brightness of his coming: him

2:9. Whose coming is according to the working of Satan, in all power and
signs and lying wonders:

2:10. And in all seduction of iniquity to them that perish: because they
receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. Therefore
God shall send them the operation of error, to believe lying:

God shall send...  That is God shall suffer them to be deceived by lying
wonders, and false miracles, in punishment of their not entertaining the
love of truth.

2:11. That all may be judged who have not believed the truth but have
consented to iniquity.

2:12. But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren,
beloved of God, for that God hath chosen you firstfruits unto salvation,
in sanctification of the spirit and faith of the truth:

2:13. Whereunto also he hath called you by our gospel, unto the
purchasing of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

2:14. Therefore, brethren, stand fast: and hold the traditions, which
you have learned, whether by word or by our epistle.

Traditions... See here that the unwritten traditions are no less to be
received than their epistles.

2:15. Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God and our Father, who
hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope in
grace,

2:16. Exhort your hearts and confirm you in every good work and word.

2 Thessalonians Chapter 3

He begs their prayers and warns them against idleness.

3:1. For the rest, brethren, pray for us that the word of God may run
and may be glorified, even as among you:

May run... That is, may spread itself, and have free course.

3:2. And that we may be delivered from importunate and evil men: for all
men have not faith.

3:3. But God is faithful, who will strengthen and keep you from evil.

3:4. And we have confidence concerning you in the Lord that the things
which we command, you both do and will do.

3:5. And the Lord direct your hearts, in the charity of God and the
patience of Christ.

3:6. And we charge you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that you withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly and
not according to the tradition which they have received of us.

3:7. For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us. For we were not
disorderly among you.

3:8. Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing: but in labour and
in toil we worked night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of
you.

3:9. Not as if we had not power: but that we might give ourselves a
pattern unto you, to imitate us.

3:10. For also, when we were with you, this we declared to you: that, if
any man will not work, neither let him eat.

3:11. For we have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly:
working not at all, but curiously meddling.

3:12. Now we charge them that are such and beseech them by the Lord
Jesus Christ that, working with silence, they would eat their own bread.

3:13. But you, brethren, be not weary in well doing.

3:14. And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man
and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed.

3:15. Yet do not esteem him as an enemy but admonish him as a brother.

3:16. Now the Lord of peace himself give you everlasting peace in every
place. The Lord be with you all.

3:17. The salutation of Paul with my own hand: which is the sign in
every epistle. So I write.

3:18. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Produced by David Widger

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
