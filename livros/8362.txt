THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY

In this Epistle, the Apostle again instructs and admonishes Timothy in
what belonged to his office, as in the former; and also warns him to
shun the conversation of those who had erred from the truth, describing
at the same time their character, He tells him of his approaching death
and desires him to come speedily to him. It appears from this
circumstance that he wrote this second Epistle in the time of his last
imprisonment at Rome and not long before his martyrdom.


2 Timothy Chapter 1

He admonishes him to stir up the grace he received by his ordination and
not to be discouraged at his sufferings, but to hold firm the sound
doctrine of the gospel.

1:1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, according to
the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus:

1:2. To Timothy, my dearly beloved son. Grace, mercy and peace, from God
the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.

1:3. I give thanks to God, whom I serve from my forefathers, with a pure
conscience, that without ceasing I have a remembrance of thee in my
prayers, night and day.

1:4. Desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be
filled with joy:

1:5. Calling to mind that faith which is in thee unfeigned, which also
dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and in thy mother Eunice, and I am
certain that in thee also.

1:6. For which cause I admonish thee that thou stir up the grace of God
which is in thee by the imposition of my hands.

1:7. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear: but of power and of
love and of sobriety.

1:8. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of
me his prisoner: but labour with the gospel, according to the power of
God.

1:9. Who hath delivered us and called us by his holy calling, not
according to our own works, but according to his own purpose and grace,
which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of the world:

1:10. But is now made manifest by the illumination of our Saviour Jesus
Christ, who hath destroyed death and hath brought to light life and
incorruption by the gospel.

By the illumination... That is, by the bright coming and appearing of
our Saviour.

1:11. Wherein I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and teacher of
the Gentiles.

1:12. For which cause, I also suffer these things: but I am not ashamed.
For I know whom I have believed and I am certain that he is able to keep
that which I have committed unto him, against that day.

1:13. Hold the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me: in faith
and in the love which is in Christ Jesus.

1:14. Keep the good thing committed to thy trust by the Holy Ghost who
dwelleth in us.

1:15. Thou knowest this, that all they who are in Asia are turned away
from me: of whom are Phigellus and Hermogenes.

1:16. The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus: because he hath
often refreshed me and hath not been ashamed of my chain:

1:17. But when he was come to Rome, he carefully sought me and found me.

1:18. The Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day. And
in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou very well
knowest.

2 Timothy Chapter 2

He exhorts him to diligence in his office and patience in suffering. The
danger of the delusions of heretics.

2:1. Thou therefore, my son, be strong in Christ Jesus:

2:2. And the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, the
same commend to faithful men who shall be fit to teach others also.

2:3. Labour as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.

2:4. No man, being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular
businesses: that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.

2:5. For he also that striveth for the mastery is not crowned, except he
strive lawfully.

2:6. The husbandman that laboureth must first partake of the fruits.

2:7. Understand what I say: for the Lord will give thee in all things
understanding.

2:8. Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the dead,
of the seed of David, according to my gospel:

2:9. Wherein I labour even unto bands, as an evildoer. But the word of
God is not bound.

2:10. Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they
also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly
glory.

2:11. A faithful saying: for if we be dead with him, we shall live also
with him.

2:12. If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. If we deny him, he
will also deny us.

2:13. If we believe not, he continueth faithful, he cannot deny himself.

2:14. Of these things put them in mind, charging them before the Lord.
Contend not in words: for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of
the hearers.

2:15. Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman
that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.

2:16. But shun profane and vain babblings: for they grow much towards
ungodliness.

2:17. And their speech spreadeth like a canker: of whom are Hymeneus and
Philetus:

2:18. Who have erred from the truth, saying that the resurrection is
past already, and have subverted the faith of some.

2:19. But the sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal:
the Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one depart from iniquity who
nameth the name of the Lord.

2:20. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
silver, but also of wood and of earth: and some indeed unto honour, but
some unto dishonour.

2:21. If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be
a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord, prepared
unto every good work.

2:22. But flee thou youthful desires, and pursue justice, faith, charity
and peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

2:23. And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget
strifes.

2:24. But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle: but be mild toward
all men, apt to teach, patient,

2:25. With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth: if
peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth;

2:26. And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil by
whom they are held captive at his will.

2 Timothy Chapter 3

The character of heretics of latter days. He exhorts Timothy to
constancy. Of the great profit of the knowledge of the scriptures.

3:1. Know also this, that in the last days shall come dangerous times.

3:2. Men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, haughty, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked,

3:3. Without affection, without peace, slanderers, incontinent,
unmerciful, without kindness,

3:4. Traitors, stubborn, puffed up, and lovers of pleasure more than of
God:

3:5. Having an appearance indeed of godliness but denying the power
thereof. Now these avoid.

3:6. For of these sort are they who creep into houses and lead captive
silly women laden with sins, who are led away with divers desires:

3:7. Ever learning, and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth.

3:8. Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the
truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.

Jannes and Mambres... The magicians of king Pharao.

3:9. But they shall proceed no farther: for their folly shall be
manifest to all men, as theirs also was.

3:10. But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,
faith, longsuffering, love, patience,

3:11. Persecutions, afflictions: such as came upon me at Antioch, at
Iconium and at Lystra: what persecutions I endured, and out of them all
the Lord delivered me.

3:12. And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
persecution.

3:13. But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse: erring, and
driving into error,

3:14. But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned and
which have been committed to thee. Knowing of whom thou hast learned
them:

3:15. And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures
which can instruct thee to salvation by the faith which is in Christ
Jesus.

3:16. All scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to
reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice:

All scripture,... Every part of divine scripture is certainly profitable
for all these ends. But, if we would have the whole rule of Christian
faith and practice, we must not be content with those Scriptures, which
Timothy knew from his infancy, that is, with the Old Testament alone:
nor yet with the New Testament, without taking along with it the
traditions of the apostles, and the interpretation of the church, to
which the apostles delivered both the book, and the true meaning of it.

3:17. That the man of God may be perfect, furnished to every good work.

2 Timothy Chapter 4

His charge to Timothy. He tells him of his approaching death and desires
him to come to him.

4:1. I charge thee, before God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge the
living and the dead, by his coming and his kingdom:

4:2. Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season: reprove,
entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine.

4:3. For there shall be a time when they will not endure sound doctrine
but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves
teachers having itching ears:

4:4. And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be
turned unto fables.

4:5. But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an
evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. Be sober.

An evangelist... a diligent preacher of the gospel.

4:6. For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my
dissolution is at hand.

4:7. I have fought a good fight: I have finished my course: I have kept
the faith.

4:8. As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice which
the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day: and not only to
me, but to them also that love his coming. Make haste to come to me
quickly.

4:9. For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to
Thessalonica:

4:10. Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.

4:11. Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with thee: for he is
profitable to me for the ministry.

4:12. But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.

4:13. The cloak that I left at Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest,
bring with thee: and the books, especially the parchments.

4:14. Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil: the Lord will
reward him according to his works:

4:15. Whom do thou also avoid: for he hath greatly withstood our words.

4:16. At my first answer, no man stood with me: but all forsook me.  May
it not be laid to their charge!

4:17. But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that by me the
preaching may be accomplished and that all the Gentiles may hear.  And I
was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

4:18. The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work and will preserve
me unto his heavenly kingdom. To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

4:19. Salute Prisca, and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.

4:20. Erastus remained at Corinth. And Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.

4:21. Make haste to come before winter. Eubulus and Pudens and Linus and
Claudia and all the brethren, salute thee.

4:22. The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
Amen.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
