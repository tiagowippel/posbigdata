The Project Gutenberg Etext of Tour Du Mond 80 Jours by Jules Verne
********This file should be named 3456-8.txt or 3456-8.zip*******

This etext was produced by John Walker

Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net
http://promo.net/pg


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext02
or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02

Or /etext01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this etext,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this

     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you

                     LE TOUR DU MONDE EN 80 JOURS
                        Etext Production Notes

This is a public domain Etext edition of Jules Verne's Le tour du
monde en 80 jours (Around the World in 80 Days).

This Etext is an unabridged reproduction of the original 1873 Hetzel
edition.  I have corrected several minor typographical errors, but
otherwise the text is precisely as published; modern readers will
discover a distinct 19th century flavour in the vocabulary and grammar
(get ready to remember everything you've forgotten about the _pass�
simple_, in particular).

This document is supplied in the ISO 8859/1 Latin-1 character set
which includes the accented characters used in French. The ISO 8859/1
character set is a superset of 7-bit ASCII and is the first 256
characters of the 16-bit Unicode set. The following lines should be a
sequence of letters, unaccented in the first line, with a variety of
accents in subsequent lines. If your computer shows these as anything
other than the correctly accented characters, French words in the body
of the document will also be incorrect.

   Sans accent:     A E I O U   a e i o u     C c
    Grave:          � � � � �   � � � � �
    Aigu:           � � � � �   � � � � �
    Circonflexe:    � � � � �   � � � � �
    Di�r�se:        � � � � �   � � � � �
    Cedille:                                  � �

                      Beautifully Typeset Etexts
                      --------------------------

Free Plain Vanilla Etexts don't have to be austere and typographically
uninviting.  Most literature (as opposed to scientific publications,
for example), is typographically simple and can be rendered
beautifully into type without encoding it into proprietary word
processor file formats or impenetrable markup languages.

This Etext is encoded in a form which permits it to be both read
directly  (Plain Vanilla) and typeset in a form virtually
indistinguishable from printed editions of the work.

To create "typographically friendly" Etexts, I adhere to the following
rules.  Rules not used in this Etext are prefixed with "**".

    1.  Characters follow the 8-bit ISO 8859/1 Latin-1 character set.
        ASCII is a proper subset of this character set, so any "Plain
        ASCII" file meets ths criterion by definition.  The extension
        to ISO 8859/1 is required so that Etexts which include the
        accented characters used by Western European languages may
        continue to be "readable by both humans and computers".

    2.  No white space characters other than blanks and line
        separators are used (in particular, tabs are expanded to
        spaces).

    3.  The text bracket sequence:
        <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
        appears both before and after the actual body of the Etext.
        This  allows  including an arbitrary prefix and postfix to the
        body of the document.

    4.  Normal body text begins in column 1 and is set ragged right
        with a line length of 70 characters.  The choice of 70
        characters is arbitrary and was made to avoid over-long and
        therefore less readable lines in the Plain Vanilla text.

    5.  Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.

    6.  Centering, right, and left justification is indicated by
        actually so-justifying the text within the 70 character line.
        Left justified lines should start in column 2 to avoid
        confusion with paragraph body text.

**  7.  Block quotations are indented to start in column 5 and set
        ragged right with a line length of 60 characters.

    8.  Text set in italics is bracketed by underscore characters,
        "_".  These must match.

    9.  Footnotes are included in-line, bracketed by "[]".  The
        footnote appears at the point in the copy where the footnote
        mark appears in the source text.

   10.  The title is defined as the sequence of lines which appear
        between the first text bracket "<><><>..." and a centered line
        consisting exclusively of more than two equal signs "====".

   11.  The author's name is the text which follows the line of equal
        signs marking the end of the title and precedes the first
        chapter mark.  This may be multiple lines.

   12.  Chapters are delimited by a three line sequence of centered lines:

                           <Chapter number>
                         --------------------
                            <Chapter name>

        The line of hyphen signs must be centered and contain three or
        more equal signs and no other characters other than white
        space.  Chapter "numbers" need not be numeric--they can be any
        text.  Documents without chapter breaks should contain an
        initial chapter mark following the title with <Chapter number>
        of "*" and a blank <Chapter name>.

   13.  Dashes in the text are indicated in the normal typewritten
        text convention of "--".  No hyphenation of words at the end
        of lines is done.

   14.  Ellipses are indicated by "..."; sentence-ending ellipses by
        "....".

** 15.  Greek letters and mathematical symbols are enclosed in the
        brackets "\(" and "\)" and are expressed as their character or
        symbol names in the LaTeX typesetting language.  For example,
        write the Greek word for "word" as:

                \( \lambda \acute{o} \gamma o \varsigma \)

        and the formula for the roots of a quadratic equation as:

                \( x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \)

        (Note: I acknowledge that this provision is controversial.  It
        is as distasteful to me as I suspect it is to you.  In its
        defence, let me treat the Greek letter and math formula cases
        separately.  Using LaTeX encoding for Greek letters is purely
        a stopgap until Unicode comes into common use on enough
        computers so that we can  use it for Etexts which contain
        characters  not in the ASCII or ISO 8859/1 sets (which are the
        7- and 8-bit subsets of Unicode, respectively).  If an author
        uses a Greek word in the text, we have two ways to proceed in
        attempting to meet the condition:

             The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
             does *not* contain characters other than those
             intended by the author of the work, although....

        The first approach is to transliterate into Roman characters
        according to a standard table such as that given in The
        Chicago Manual of Style.  This preserves readability and
        doesn't require funny encoding, but in a sense violates the
        author's "original intent"--the author could have
        transliterated the word in the first place but chose not to.
        By transliterating we're reversing the author's decision.  The
        second  approach, encoding in LaTeX or some other markup
        language, preserves the distinction that the author wrote the
        word in Greek and maintains readability since letters are
        called out by their English language names, for the most part.
        Of course LaTeX helps us only for Greek (and a few characters
        from other languages).  If you're faced with Cyrillic, Arabic,
        Chinese, Japanese, or other languages written in non-Roman
        letters, the only option (pre-Unicode) is to transliterate.

        I argue that encoding mathematical formulas as LaTeX achieves
        the goal of "readable by humans" on the strength of LaTeX
        encoding being widely used in the physics and mathematics
        communities when writing formulas in E-mail and other ASCII
        media.  Just as one is free to to transliterate Greek in an
        Etext, one can use ASCII artwork formulas such as:

                                          ---------
                                     +   /  2
                                  -b - \/  b  - 4ac
                        x     =  ------------------
                         1,2            2a

        This is probably a better choice for occasional formulas
        simple enough to write out this way.  But to produce Etexts of
        historic  scientific publications, Einstein's "Zur
        Elektrodynamik bewegter K�rper" (the special relativity paper
        published in _Annalen der Physik_ in 1905), trying to render
        the hundreds of complicated equations in ASCII is not only
        extremely tedious but in all likelihood counter-productive;
        ambiguities in trying to render complex equations would make
        it difficult for a reader to determine precisely what Einstein
        wrote unless conventions just as complicated (and harder to
        learn) as those of LaTeX were adopted for ASCII expression of
        mathematics.  Finally, the choice of LaTeX encoding is made
        not only based on its existing widespread use but because the
        underlying software that defines it (TeX and LaTeX) are
        entirely in the public domain, available in source code form,
        implemented on most commonly-available computers, and frozen
        by their authors so that, unlike many commercial products, the
        syntax is unlikely to change in the future and obsolete
        current texts).

   16.  Other punctuation in the text consists only of the characters:

           . , : ; ? ! ` ' ( ) { } " + = - / * @ # $ % & ~ ^ | < >

        In other words, the characters:

           _ [ ] \

        are never used except in the special senses defined above.

** 17.  Quote marks may be rendered explicitly as open and quote marks
        with the sequences `single quotes' or ``double quotes''.  As
        long as quotes are balanced within a paragraph, the ASCII
        quote character '"' may be used.  Alternate occurrences of
        this character will be typeset as opening and closing quote
        characters.  The open/close quote state is reset at the start
        of each paragraph, limiting the scope of errors to a single
        paragraph.

To demonstrate typesetting of an Etext prepared in this form, a C
program is appended to the end of this Etext which, extracted and
compiled, will read the Etext and emit either LaTeX source code which,
fed to LaTeX will produce a camera-ready book complete with table of
contents, or an HTML document tree suitable for publication on the
Web.  This program produces LaTeX output solely as an illustration; it
can be modified to produce documents suitable for other formatting
systems.  The output of the program usually requires some manual
editing to produce output of the highest quality, but the raw output
of the program is still generally far more readable than an
unformatted file.  The C program is in the public domain and may be
used and modified in any manner without restrictions.

               DANS LEQUEL PHILEAS FOGG ET PASSEPARTOUT
            S'ACCEPTENT R�CIPROQUEMENT L'UN COMME MA�TRE,
                       L'AUTRE COMME DOMESTIQUE

En l'ann�e 1872, la maison portant le num�ro 7 de Saville-row,
Burlington Gardens -- maison dans laquelle Sheridan mourut en 1814 --,
�tait habit�e par Phileas Fogg, esq., l'un des membres les plus
singuliers et les plus remarqu�s du Reform-Club de Londres, bien qu'il
sembl�t prendre � t�che de ne rien faire qui p�t attirer l'attention.

A l'un des plus grands orateurs qui honorent l'Angleterre, succ�dait
donc ce Phileas Fogg, personnage �nigmatique, dont on ne savait rien,
sinon que c'�tait un fort galant homme et l'un des plus beaux
gentlemen de la haute soci�t� anglaise.

On disait qu'il ressemblait � Byron -- par la t�te, car il �tait
irr�prochable quant aux pieds --, mais un Byron � moustaches et �
favoris, un Byron impassible, qui aurait v�cu mille ans sans vieillir.

Anglais, � coup s�r, Phileas Fogg n'�tait peut-�tre pas Londonner. On
ne l'avait jamais vu ni � la Bourse, ni � la Banque, ni dans aucun des
comptoirs de la Cit�. Ni les bassins ni les docks de Londres
n'avaient jamais re�u un navire ayant pour armateur Phileas Fogg. Ce
gentleman ne figurait dans aucun comit� d'administration. Son nom
n'avait jamais retenti dans un coll�ge d'avocats, ni au Temple, ni �
Lincoln's-inn, ni � Gray's-inn. Jamais il ne plaida ni � la Cour du
chancelier, ni au Banc de la Reine, ni � l'�chiquier, ni en Cour
eccl�siastique. Il n'�tait ni industriel, ni n�gociant, ni marchand,
ni agriculteur. Il ne faisait partie ni de l'_Institution royale de
la Grande-Bretagne_, ni de l'_Institution de Londres_, ni de
l'_Institution des Artisans_, ni de l'_Institution Russell_, ni de
l'_Institution litt�raire de l'Ouest_, ni de l'_Institution du Droit_,
ni de cette _Institution des Arts et des Sciences r�unis_, qui est
plac�e sous le patronage direct de Sa Gracieuse Majest�. Il
n'appartenait enfin � aucune des nombreuses soci�t�s qui pullulent
dans la capitale de l'Angleterre, depuis la _Soci�t� de l'Armonica_
jusqu'� la _Soci�t� entomologique_, fond�e principalement dans le but
de d�truire les insectes nuisibles.

Phileas Fogg �tait membre du Reform-Club, et voil� tout.

A qui s'�tonnerait de ce qu'un gentleman aussi myst�rieux compt�t
parmi les membres de cette honorable association, on r�pondra qu'il
passa sur la recommandation de MM. Baring fr�res, chez lesquels il
avait un cr�dit ouvert. De l� une certaine � surface �, due � ce que
ses ch�ques �taient r�guli�rement pay�s � vue par le d�bit de son
compte courant invariablement cr�diteur.

Ce Phileas Fogg �tait-il riche ? Incontestablement. Mais comment il
avait fait fortune, c'est ce que les mieux inform�s ne pouvaient dire,
et Mr. Fogg �tait le dernier auquel il conv�nt de s'adresser pour
l'apprendre. En tout cas, il n'�tait prodigue de rien, mais non
avare, car partout o� il manquait un appoint pour une chose noble,
utile ou g�n�reuse, il l'apportait silencieusement et m�me
anonymement.

En somme, rien de moins communicatif que ce gentleman. Il parlait
aussi peu que possible, et semblait d'autant plus myst�rieux qu'il
�tait silencieux. Cependant sa vie �tait � jour, mais ce qu'il
faisait �tait si math�matiquement toujours la m�me chose, que
l'imagination, m�contente, cherchait au-del�.

Avait-il voyag� ? C'�tait probable, car personne ne poss�dait mieux
que lui la carte du monde. Il n'�tait endroit si recul� dont il ne
par�t avoir une connaissance sp�ciale. Quelquefois, mais en peu de
mots, brefs et clairs, il redressait les mille propos qui circulaient
dans le club au sujet des voyageurs perdus ou �gar�s ; il indiquait
les vraies probabilit�s, et ses paroles s'�taient trouv�es souvent
comme inspir�es par une seconde vue, tant l'�v�nement finissait
toujours par les justifier. C'�tait un homme qui avait d� voyager
partout, -- en esprit, tout au moins.

Ce qui �tait certain toutefois, c'est que, depuis de longues ann�es,
Phileas Fogg n'avait pas quitt� Londres. Ceux qui avaient l'honneur
de le conna�tre un peu plus que les autres attestaient que -- si ce
n'est sur ce chemin direct qu'il parcourait chaque jour pour venir de
sa maison au club -- personne ne pouvait pr�tendre l'avoir jamais vu
ailleurs. Son seul passe-temps �tait de lire les journaux et de jouer
au whist. A ce jeu du silence, si bien appropri� � sa nature, il
gagnait souvent, mais ses gains n'entraient jamais dans sa bourse et
figuraient pour une somme importante � son budget de charit�.
D'ailleurs, il faut le remarquer, Mr. Fogg jouait �videmment pour
jouer, non pour gagner. Le jeu �tait pour lui un combat, une lutte
contre une difficult�, mais une lutte sans mouvement, sans
d�placement, sans fatigue, et cela allait � son caract�re.

On ne connaissait � Phileas Fogg ni femme ni enfants, -- ce qui peut
arriver aux gens les plus honn�tes, -- ni parents ni amis, -- ce qui
est plus rare en v�rit�. Phileas Fogg vivait seul dans sa maison de
Saville-row, o� personne ne p�n�trait. De son int�rieur, jamais il
n'�tait question. Un seul domestique suffisait � le servir.
D�jeunant, d�nant au club � des heures chronom�triquement d�termin�es,
dans la m�me salle, � la m�me table, ne traitant point ses coll�gues,
n'invitant aucun �tranger, il ne rentrait chez lui que pour se
coucher, � minuit pr�cis, sans jamais user de ces chambres
confortables que le Reform-Club tient � la disposition des membres du
cercle. Sur vingt-quatre heures, il en passait dix � son domicile,
soit qu'il dorm�t, soit qu'il s'occup�t de sa toilette. S'il se
promenait, c'�tait invariablement, d'un pas �gal, dans la salle
d'entr�e parquet�e en marqueterie, ou sur la galerie circulaire,
au-dessus de laquelle s'arrondit un d�me � vitraux bleus, que
supportent vingt colonnes ioniques en porphyre rouge. S'il d�nait ou
d�jeunait, c'�taient les cuisines, le garde-manger, l'office, la
poissonnerie, la laiterie du club, qui fournissaient � sa table leurs
succulentes r�serves ; c'�taient les domestiques du club, graves
personnages en habit noir, chauss�s de souliers � semelles de
molleton, qui le servaient dans une porcelaine sp�ciale et sur un
admirable linge en toile de Saxe ; c'�taient les cristaux � moule
perdu du club qui contenaient son sherry, son porto ou son claret
m�lang� de cannelle, de capillaire et de cinnamome ; c'�tait enfin la
glace du club -- glace venue � grands frais des lacs d'Am�rique -- qui
entretenait ses boissons dans un satisfaisant �tat de fra�cheur.

Si vivre dans ces conditions, c'est �tre un excentrique, il faut
convenir que l'excentricit� a du bon !

La maison de Saville-row, sans �tre somptueuse, se recommandait par un
extr�me confort. D'ailleurs, avec les habitudes invariables du
locataire, le service s'y r�duisait � peu. Toutefois, Phileas Fogg
exigeait de son unique domestique une ponctualit�, une r�gularit�
extraordinaires. Ce jour-l� m�me, 2 octobre, Phileas Fogg avait donn�
son cong� � James Forster -- ce gar�on s'�tant rendu coupable de lui
avoir apport� pour sa barbe de l'eau � quatre-vingt-quatre degr�s
Fahrenheit au lieu de quatre-vingt-six --, et il attendait son
successeur, qui devait se pr�senter entre onze heures et onze heures
et demie.

Phileas Fogg, carr�ment assis dans son fauteuil, les deux pieds
rapproch�s comme ceux d'un soldat � la parade, les mains appuy�es sur
les genoux, le corps droit, la t�te haute, regardait marcher
l'aiguille de la pendule, -- appareil compliqu� qui indiquait les
heures, les minutes, les secondes, les jours, les quanti�mes et
l'ann�e. A onze heures et demie sonnant, Mr. Fogg devait, suivant sa
quotidienne habitude, quitter la maison et se rendre au Reform-Club.

En ce moment, on frappa � la porte du petit salon dans lequel se
tenait Phileas Fogg.

James Forster, le cong�di�, apparut.

� Le nouveau domestique �, dit-il,

Un gar�on �g� d'une trentaine d'ann�es se montra et salua.

� Vous �tes Fran�ais et vous vous nommez John ? lui demanda Phileas
Fogg.

-- Jean, n'en d�plaise � monsieur, r�pondit le nouveau venu, Jean
Passepartout, un surnom qui m'est rest�, et que justifiait mon
aptitude naturelle � me tirer d'affaire. Je crois �tre un honn�te
gar�on, monsieur, mais, pour �tre franc, j'ai fait plusieurs m�tiers.
J'ai �t� chanteur ambulant, �cuyer dans un cirque, faisant de la
voltige comme L�otard, et dansant sur la corde comme Blondin ; puis je
suis devenu professeur de gymnastique, afin de rendre mes talents plus
utiles, et, en dernier lieu, j'�tais sergent de pompiers, � Paris.
J'ai m�me dans mon dossier des incendies remarquables. Mais voil�
cinq ans que j'ai quitt� la France et que, voulant go�ter de la vie de
famille, je suis valet de chambre en Angleterre. Or, me trouvant sans
place et ayant appris que M. Phileas Fogg �tait l'homme le plus exact
et le plus s�dentaire du Royaume-Uni, je me suis pr�sent� chez
monsieur avec l'esp�rance d'y vivre tranquille et d'oublier jusqu'� ce
nom de Passepartout...

-- Passepartout me convient, r�pondit le gentleman. Vous m'�tes
recommand�. J'ai de bons renseignements sur votre compte. Vous
connaissez mes conditions ?

-- Oui, monsieur.

-- Bien. Quelle heure avez-vous ?

-- Onze heures vingt-deux, r�pondit Passepartout, en tirant des
profondeurs de son gousset une �norme montre d'argent.

-- Vous retardez, dit Mr. Fogg.

-- Que monsieur me pardonne, mais c'est impossible.

-- Vous retardez de quatre minutes. N'importe. Il suffit de
constater l'�cart. Donc, � partir de ce moment, onze heures
vingt-neuf du matin, ce mercredi 2 octobre 1872, vous �tes � mon
service. �

Cela dit, Phileas Fogg se leva, prit son chapeau de la main gauche, le
pla�a sur sa t�te avec un mouvement d'automate et disparut sans
ajouter une parole.

Passepartout entendit la porte de la rue se fermer une premi�re fois :
c'�tait son nouveau ma�tre qui sortait ; puis une seconde fois :
c'�tait son pr�d�cesseur, James Forster, qui s'en allait � son tour.

Passepartout demeura seul dans la maison de Saville-row.


                                  II
                         --------------------
                    OU PASSEPARTOUT EST CONVAINCU
                    QU'IL A ENFIN TROUVE SON IDEAL

� Sur ma foi, se dit Passepartout, un peu ahuri tout d'abord, j'ai
connu chez Mme Tussaud des bonshommes aussi vivants que mon nouveau
ma�tre ! �

Il convient de dire ici que les � bonshommes � de Mme Tussaud sont des
figures de cire, fort visit�es � Londres, et auxquelles il ne manque
vraiment que la parole.

Pendant les quelques instants qu'il venait d'entrevoir Phileas Fogg,
Passepartout avait rapidement, mais soigneusement examin� son futur
ma�tre. C'�tait un homme qui pouvait avoir quarante ans, de figure
noble et belle, haut de taille, que ne d�parait pas un l�ger
embonpoint, blond de cheveux et de favoris, front uni sans apparences
de rides aux tempes, figure plut�t p�le que color�e, dents
magnifiques. Il paraissait poss�der au plus haut degr� ce que les
physionomistes appellent � le repos dans l'action �, facult� commune �
tous ceux qui font plus de besogne que de bruit. Calme, flegmatique,
l'oeil pur, la paupi�re immobile, c'�tait le type achev� de ces
Anglais � sang-froid qui se rencontrent assez fr�quemment dans le
Royaume-Uni, et dont Angelica Kauffmann a merveilleusement rendu sous
son pinceau l'attitude un peu acad�mique. Vu dans les divers actes de
son existence, ce gentleman donnait l'id�e d'un �tre bien �quilibr�
dans toutes ses parties, justement pond�r�, aussi parfait qu'un
chronom�tre de Leroy ou de Earnshaw. C'est qu'en effet, Phileas Fogg
�tait l'exactitude personnifi�e, ce qui se voyait clairement �
� l'expression de ses pieds et de ses mains �, car chez l'homme, aussi
bien que chez les animaux, les membres eux-m�mes sont des organes
expressifs des passions.

Phileas Fogg �tait de ces gens math�matiquement exacts, qui, jamais
press�s et toujours pr�ts, sont �conomes de leurs pas et de leurs
mouvements. Il ne faisait pas une enjamb�e de trop, allant toujours
par le plus court. Il ne perdait pas un regard au plafond. Il ne se
permettait aucun geste superflu. On ne l'avait jamais vu �mu ni
troubl�. C'�tait l'homme le moins h�t� du monde, mais il arrivait
toujours � temps. Toutefois, on comprendra qu'il v�c�t seul et pour
ainsi dire en dehors de toute relation sociale. Il savait que dans la
vie il faut faire la part des frottements, et comme les frottements
retardent, il ne se frottait � personne.

Quant � Jean, dit Passepartout, un vrai Parisien de Paris, depuis cinq
ans qu'il habitait l'Angleterre et y faisait � Londres le m�tier de
valet de chambre, il avait cherch� vainement un ma�tre auquel il p�t
s'attacher.

Passepartout n'�tait point un de ces Frontins ou Mascarilles qui, les
�paules hautes, le nez au vent, le regard assur�, l'oeil sec, ne sont
que d'impudents dr�les. Non. Passepartout �tait un brave gar�on, de
physionomie aimable, aux l�vres un peu saillantes, toujours pr�tes �
go�ter ou � caresser, un �tre doux et serviable, avec une de ces
bonnes t�tes rondes que l'on aime � voir sur les �paules d'un ami. Il
avait les yeux bleus, le teint anim�, la figure assez grasse pour
qu'il p�t lui-m�me voir les pommettes de ses joues, la poitrine large,
la taille forte, une musculature vigoureuse, et il poss�dait une force
hercul�enne que les exercices de sa jeunesse avaient admirablement
d�velopp�e. Ses cheveux bruns �taient un peu rageurs. Si les
sculpteurs de l'Antiquit� connaissaient dix-huit fa�ons d'arranger la
chevelure de Minerve, Passepartout n'en connaissait qu'une pour
disposer la sienne : trois coups de d�m�loir, et il �tait coiff�.

De dire si le caract�re expansif de ce gar�on s'accorderait avec celui
de Phileas Fogg, c'est ce que la prudence la plus �l�mentaire ne
permet pas. Passepartout serait-il ce domestique fonci�rement exact
qu'il fallait � son ma�tre ? On ne le verrait qu'a l'user. Apr�s
avoir eu, on le sait, une jeunesse assez vagabonde, il aspirait au
repos. Ayant entendu vanter le m�thodisme anglais et la froideur
proverbiale des gentlemen, il vint chercher fortune en Angleterre.
Mais, jusqu'alors, le sort l'avait mal servi. Il n'avait pu prendre
racine nulle part. Il avait fait dix maisons. Dans toutes, on �tait
fantasque, in�gal, coureur d'aventures ou coureur de pays, -- ce qui
ne pouvait plus convenir � Passepartout. Son dernier ma�tre, le jeune
Lord Longsferry, membre du Parlement, apr�s avoir pass� ses nuits dans
les � oysters-rooms � d'Hay-Market, rentrait trop souvent au logis sur
les �paules des policemen. Passepartout, voulant avant tout pouvoir
respecter son ma�tre, risqua quelques respectueuses observations qui
furent mal re�ues, et il rompit. Il apprit, sur les entrefaites, que
Phileas Fogg, esq., cherchait un domestique. Il prit des
renseignements sur ce gentleman. Un personnage dont l'existence �tait
si r�guli�re, qui ne d�couchait pas, qui ne voyageait pas, qui ne
s'absentait jamais, pas m�me un jour, ne pouvait que lui convenir. Il
se pr�senta et fut admis dans les circonstances que l'on sait.

Passepartout -- onze heures et demie �tant sonn�es -- se trouvait donc
seul dans la maison de Saville-row. Aussit�t il en commen�a
l'inspection. Il la parcourut de la cave au grenier. Cette maison
propre, rang�e, s�v�re, puritaine, bien organis�e pour le service, lui
plut. Elle lui fit l'effet d'une belle coquille de colima�on, mais
d'une coquille �clair�e et chauff�e au gaz, car l'hydrog�ne carbur� y
suffisait � tous les besoins de lumi�re et de chaleur. Passepartout
trouva sans peine, au second �tage, la chambre qui lui �tait destin�e.
Elle lui convint. Des timbres �lectriques et des tuyaux acoustiques
la mettaient en communication avec les appartements de l'entresol et
du premier �tage. Sur la chemin�e, une pendule �lectrique
correspondait avec la pendule de la chambre � coucher de Phileas Fogg,
et les deux appareils battaient au m�me instant, la m�me seconde.

� Cela me va, cela me va ! � se dit Passepartout.

Il remarqua aussi, dans sa chambre, une notice affich�e au-dessus de
la pendule. C'�tait le programme du service quotidien. Il comprenait
-- depuis huit heures du matin, heure r�glementaire � laquelle se
levait Phileas Fogg, jusqu'� onze heures et demie, heure � laquelle il
quittait sa maison pour aller d�jeuner au Reform-Club -- tous les
d�tails du service, le th� et les r�ties de huit heures vingt-trois,
l'eau pour la barbe de neuf heures trente-sept, la coiffure de dix
heures moins vingt, etc. Puis de onze heures et demie du matin �
minuit -- heure � laquelle se couchait le m�thodique gentleman --,
tout �tait not�, pr�vu, r�gularis�. Passepartout se fit une joie de
m�diter ce programme et d'en graver les divers articles dans son
esprit.

Quant � la garde-robe de monsieur, elle �tait fort bien mont�e et
merveilleusement comprise. Chaque pantalon, habit ou gilet portait un
num�ro d'ordre reproduit sur un registre d'entr�e et de sortie,
indiquant la date � laquelle, suivant la saison, ces v�tements
devaient �tre tour � tour port�s. M�me r�glementation pour les
chaussures.

En somme, dans cette maison de Saville-row qui devait �tre le temple
du d�sordre � l'�poque de l'illustre mais dissip� Sheridan --,
ameublement confortable, annon�ant une belle aisance. Pas de
biblioth�que, pas de livres, qui eussent �t� sans utilit� pour Mr.
Fogg, puisque le Reform-Club mettait � sa disposition deux
biblioth�ques, l'une consacr�e aux lettres, l'autre au droit et � la
politique. Dans la chambre � coucher, un coffre-fort de moyenne
grandeur, que sa construction d�fendait aussi bien de l'incendie que
du vol. Point d'armes dans la maison, aucun ustensile de chasse ou de
guerre. Tout y d�notait les habitudes les plus pacifiques.

Apr�s avoir examin� cette demeure en d�tail, Passepartout se frotta
les mains, sa large figure s'�panouit, et il r�p�ta joyeusement :

�Cela me va ! voil� mon affaire ! Nous nous entendrons parfaitement,
Mr. Fogg et moi ! Un homme casanier et r�gulier ! Une v�ritable
m�canique ! Eh bien, je ne suis pas f�ch� de servir une m�canique ! �

                                 III
                         --------------------
         OU S'ENGAGE UNE CONVERSATION QUI POURRA COUTER CHER
                            A PHILEAS FOGG

Phileas Fogg avait quitt� sa maison de Saville-row � onze heures et
demie, et, apr�s avoir plac� cinq cent soixante-quinze fois son pied
droit devant son pied gauche et cinq cent soixante-seize fois son pied
gauche devant son pied droit, il arriva au Reform-Club, vaste �difice,
�lev� dans Pall-Mall, qui n'a pas co�t� moins de trois millions �
b�tir.

Phileas Fogg se rendit aussit�t � la salle � manger, dont les neuf
fen�tres s'ouvraient sur un beau jardin aux arbres d�j� dor�s par
l'automne. L�, il prit place � la table habituelle o� son couvert
l'attendait. Son d�jeuner se composait d'un hors-d'oeuvre, d'un
poisson bouilli relev� d'une � reading sauce � de premier choix, d'un
roastbeef �carlate agr�ment� de condiments � mushroom �, d'un g�teau
farci de tiges de rhubarbe et de groseilles vertes, d'un morceau de
chester, -- le tout arros� de quelques tasses de cet excellent th�,
sp�cialement recueilli pour l'office du Reform-Club.

A midi quarante-sept, ce gentleman se leva et se dirigea vers le grand
salon, somptueuse pi�ce, orn�e de peintures richement encadr�es. L�,
un domestique lui remit le _Times_ non coup�, dont Phileas Fogg op�ra
le laborieux d�pliage avec une s�ret� de main qui d�notait une grande
habitude de cette difficile op�ration. La lecture de ce journal
occupa Phileas Fogg jusqu'� trois heures quarante-cinq, et celle du
_Standard_ -- qui lui succ�da -- dura jusqu'au d�ner. Ce repas
s'accomplit dans les m�mes conditions que le d�jeuner, avec adjonction
de � royal british sauce �.

A six heures moins vingt, le gentleman reparut dans le grand salon et
s'absorba dans la lecture du _Morning Chronicle_.

Une demi-heure plus tard, divers membres du Reform-Club faisaient leur
entr�e et s'approchaient de la chemin�e, o� br�lait un feu de houille.
C'�taient les partenaires habituels de Mr. Phileas Fogg, comme lui
enrag�s joueurs de whist : l'ing�nieur Andrew Stuart, les banquiers
John Sullivan et Samuel Fallentin, le brasseur Thomas Flanagan,
Gauthier Ralph, un des administrateurs de la Banque d'Angleterre, --
personnages riches et consid�r�s, m�me dans ce club qui compte parmi
ses membres les sommit�s de l'industrie et de la finance.

� Eh bien, Ralph, demanda Thomas Flanagan, o� en est cette affaire de
vol ?

-- Eh bien, r�pondit Andrew Stuart, la Banque en sera pour son argent.

-- J'esp�re, au contraire, dit Gauthier Ralph, que nous mettrons la
main sur l'auteur du vol. Des inspecteurs de police, gens fort
habiles, ont �t� envoy�s en Am�rique et en Europe, dans tous les
principaux ports d'embarquement et de d�barquement, et il sera
difficile � ce monsieur de leur �chapper.

-- Mais on a donc le signalement du voleur ? demanda Andrew Stuart.

-- D'abord, ce n'est pas un voleur, r�pondit s�rieusement Gauthier
Ralph.

-- Comment, ce n'est pas un voleur, cet individu qui a soustrait
cinquante-cinq mille livres en bank-notes (1 million 375 000 francs) ?

-- Non, r�pondit Gauthier Ralph.

-- C'est donc un industriel ? dit John Sullivan.

-- Le _Morning Chronicle_ assure que c'est un gentleman. �

Celui qui fit cette r�ponse n'�tait autre que Phileas Fogg, dont la
t�te �mergeait alors du flot de papier amass� autour de lui. En m�me
temps, Phileas Fogg salua ses coll�gues, qui lui rendirent son salut.

Le fait dont il �tait question, que les divers journaux du Royaume-Uni
discutaient avec ardeur, s'�tait accompli trois jours auparavant, le
29 septembre. Une liasse de bank-notes, formant l'�norme somme de
cinquante-cinq mille livres, avait �t� prise sur la tablette du
caissier principal de la Banque d'Angleterre.

A qui s'�tonnait qu'un tel vol e�t pu s'accomplir aussi facilement, le
sous-gouverneur Gauthier Ralph se bornait � r�pondre qu'� ce moment
m�me, le caissier s'occupait d'enregistrer une recette de trois
shillings six pence, et qu'on ne saurait avoir l'oeil � tout.

Mais il convient de faire observer ici -- ce qui rend le fait plus
explicable -- que cet admirable �tablissement de � Bank of England �
para�t se soucier extr�mement de la dignit� du public. Point de
gardes, point d'invalides, point de grillages ! L'or, l'argent, les
billets sont expos�s librement et pour ainsi dire � la merci du
premier venu. On ne saurait mettre en suspicion l'honorabilit� d'un
passant quelconque. Un des meilleurs observateurs des usages anglais
raconte m�me ceci : Dans une des salles de la Banque o� il se trouvait
un jour, il eut la curiosit� de voir de plus pris un lingot d'or
pesant sept � huit livres, qui se trouvait expos� sur la tablette du
caissier ; il prit ce lingot, l'examina, le passa � son voisin,
celui-ci � un autre, si bien que le lingot, de main en main, s'en alla
jusqu'au fond d'un corridor obscur, et ne revint qu'une demi-heure
apr�s reprendre sa place, sans que le caissier e�t seulement lev� la
t�te.

Mais, le 29 septembre, les choses ne se pass�rent pas tout � fait
ainsi. La liasse de bank-notes ne revint pas, et quand la magnifique
horloge, pos�e au-dessus du � drawing-office �, sonna � cinq heures la
fermeture des bureaux, la Banque d'Angleterre n'avait plus qu'� passer
cinquante-cinq mille livres par le compte de profits et pertes.

Le vol bien et d�ment reconnu, des agents, des � d�tectives �, choisis
parmi les plus habiles, furent envoy�s dans les principaux ports, �
Liverpool, � Glasgow, au Havre, � Suez, � Brindisi, � New York, etc.,
avec promesse, en cas de succ�s, d'une prime de deux mille livres
(50 000 F) et cinq pour cent de la somme qui serait retrouv�e. En
attendant les renseignements que devait fournir l'enqu�te
imm�diatement commenc�e, ces inspecteurs avaient pour mission
d'observer scrupuleusement tous les voyageurs en arriv�e ou en
partance.

Or, pr�cis�ment, ainsi que le disait le _Morning Chronicle_, on avait
lieu de supposer que l'auteur du vol ne faisait partie d'aucune des
soci�t�s de voleurs d'Angleterre. Pendant cette journ�e du 29
septembre, un gentleman bien mis, de bonnes mani�res, l'air distingu�,
avait �t� remarqu�, qui allait et venait dans la salle des paiements,
th��tre du vol. L'enqu�te avait permis de refaire assez exactement le
signalement de ce gentleman, signalement qui fut aussit�t adress� �
tous les d�tectives du Royaume-Uni et du continent. quelques bons
esprits -- et Gauthier Ralph �tait du nombre -- se croyaient donc
fond�s � esp�rer que le voleur n'�chapperait pas.

Comme on le pense, ce fait �tait � l'ordre du jour � Londres et dans
toute l'Angleterre. On discutait, on se passionnait pour ou contre
les probabilit�s du succ�s de la police m�tropolitaine. On ne
s'�tonnera donc pas d'entendre les membres du Reform-Club traiter la
m�me question, d'autant plus que l'un des sous-gouverneurs de la
Banque se trouvait parmi eux.

L'honorable Gauthier Ralph ne voulait pas douter du r�sultat des
recherches, estimant que la prime offerte devrait singuli�rement
aiguiser le z�le et l'intelligence des agents. Mais son coll�gue,
Andrew Stuart, �tait loin de partager cette confiance. La discussion
continua donc entre les gentlemen, qui s'�taient assis � une table de
whist, Stuart devant Flanagan, Fallentin devant Phileas Fogg. Pendant
le jeu, les joueurs ne parlaient pas, mais entre les robres, la
conversation interrompue reprenait de plus belle.

� Je soutiens, dit Andrew Stuart, que les chances sont en faveur du
voleur, qui ne peut manquer d'�tre un habile homme !

-- Allons donc ! r�pondit Ralph, il n'y a plus un seul pays dans
lequel il puisse se r�fugier.

-- Par exemple !

-- O� voulez-vous qu'il aille ?

-- Je n'en sais rien, r�pondit Andrew Stuart, mais, apr�s tout, la
terre est assez vaste.

-- Elle l'�tait autrefois... �, dit � mi-voix Phileas Fogg. Puis :
� A vous de couper, monsieur �, ajouta-t-il en pr�sentant les cartes �
Thomas Flanagan.

La discussion fut suspendue pendant le robre. Mais bient�t Andrew
Stuart la reprenait, disant :

� Comment, autrefois ! Est-ce que la terre a diminu�, par hasard ?

-- Sans doute, r�pondit Gauthier Ralph. Je suis de l'avis de Mr.
Fogg. La terre a diminu�, puisqu'on la parcourt maintenant dix fois
plus vite qu'il y a cent ans. Et c'est ce qui, dans le cas dont nous
nous occupons, rendra les recherches plus rapides.

-- Et rendra plus facile aussi la fuite du voleur !

-- A vous de jouer, monsieur Stuart ! � dit Phileas Fogg.

Mais l'incr�dule Stuart n'�tait pas convaincu, et, la partie achev�e :

� Il faut avouer, monsieur Ralph, reprit-il, que vous avez trouv� l�
une mani�re plaisante de dire que la terre a diminu� ! Ainsi parce
qu'on en fait maintenant le tour en trois mois...

-- En quatre-vingts jours seulement, dit Phileas Fogg.

-- En effet, messieurs, ajouta John Sullivan, quatre-vingts jours,
depuis que la section entre Rothal et Allahabad a �t� ouverte sur le
� Great-Indian peninsular railway �, et voici le calcul �tabli par le
_Morning Chronicle_ :

 De Londres � Suez par le Mont-Cenis et
  Brindisi, railways et paquebots...........   7 jours
 De Suez � Bombay, paquebot.................  13 --
 De Bombay � Calcutta, railway..............   3 --
 De Calcutta � Hong-Kong (Chine), paquebot..  13 --
 De Hong-Kong � Yokohama (Japon),
  paquebot..................................   6 --
 De Yokohama � San Francisco, paquebot......  22 --
 De San Francisco New York, railroad........   7 --
 De New York � Londres, paquebot et
  railway...................................   9 --
  .                                         ---------
 Total......................................  80 jours

-- Oui, quatre-vingts jours ! s'�cria, Andrew Stuart, qui par
inattention, coupa une carte ma�tresse, mais non compris le mauvais
temps, les vents contraires, les naufrages, les d�raillements, etc.

-- Tout compris, r�pondit Phileas Fogg en continuant de jouer, car,
cette fois, la discussion ne respectait plus le whist.

-- M�me si les Indous ou les Indiens enl�vent les rails ! s'�cria
Andrew Stuart, s'ils arr�tent les trains, pillent les fourgons,
scalpent les voyageurs !

-- Tout compris �, r�pondit Phileas Fogg, qui, abattant son jeu,
ajouta : � Deux atouts ma�tres. �

Andrew Stuart, � qui c'�tait le tour de � faire �, ramassa les cartes
en disant :

� Th�oriquement, vous avez raison, monsieur Fogg, mais dans la
pratique...

-- Dans la pratique aussi, monsieur Stuart.

-- Je voudrais bien vous y voir.

-- Il ne tient qu'� vous. Partons ensemble.

-- Le Ciel m'en pr�serve ! s'�cria Stuart, mais je parierais bien
quatre mille livres (100 000 F) qu'un tel voyage, fait dans ces
conditions, est impossible.

-- Tr�s possible, au contraire, r�pondit Mr. Fogg.

-- Eh bien, faites-le donc !

-- Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours ?

-- Oui.

-- Je le veux bien.

-- Quand ?

-- Tout de suite.

-- C'est de la folie ! s'�cria Andrew Stuart, qui commen�ait � se
vexer de l'insistance de son partenaire. Tenez ! jouons plut�t.

-- Refaites alors, r�pondit Phileas Fogg, car il y a maldonne. �

Andrew Stuart reprit les cartes d'une main f�brile ; puis, tout �
coup, les posant sur la table :

� Eh bien, oui, monsieur Fogg, dit-il, oui, je parie quatre mille
livres !...

-- Mon cher Stuart, dit Fallentin, calmez-vous. Ce n'est pas s�rieux.

-- Quand je dis : je parie, r�pondit Andrew Stuart, c'est toujours
s�rieux.

-- Soit ! � dit Mr. Fogg. Puis, se tournant vers ses coll�gues :

� J'ai vingt mille livres (500 000 F) d�pos�es chez Baring fr�res. Je
les risquerai volontiers...

-- Vingt mille livres ! s'�cria John Sullivan. Vingt mille livres
qu'un retard impr�vu peut vous faire perdre !

-- L'impr�vu n'existe pas, r�pondit simplement Phileas Fogg.

-- Mais, monsieur Fogg, ce laps de quatre-vingts jours n'est calcul�
que comme un minimum de temps !

-- Un minimum bien employ� suffit � tout.

-- Mais pour ne pas le d�passer, il faut sauter math�matiquement des
railways dans les paquebots, et des paquebots dans les chemins de
fer !

-- Je sauterai math�matiquement.

-- C'est une plaisanterie !

-- Un bon Anglais ne plaisante jamais, quand il s'agit d'une chose
aussi s�rieuse qu'un pari, r�pondit Phileas Fogg. Je parie vingt
mille livres contre qui voudra que je ferai le tour de la terre en
quatre-vingts jours ou moins, soit dix-neuf cent vingt heures ou cent
quinze mille deux cents minutes. Acceptez-vous ?

-- Nous acceptons, r�pondirent MM. Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan,
Flanagan et Ralph, apr�s s'�tre entendus.

-- Bien, dit Mr. Fogg. Le train de Douvres part � huit heures
quarante-cinq. Je le prendrai.

-- Ce soir m�me ? demanda Stuart.

-- Ce soir m�me, r�pondit Phileas Fogg. Donc, ajouta-t-il en
consultant un calendrier de poche, puisque c'est aujourd'hui mercredi
2 octobre, je devrai �tre de retour � Londres, dans ce salon m�me du
Reform-Club, le samedi 21 d�cembre, � huit heures quarante-cinq du
soir, faute de quoi les vingt mille livres d�pos�es actuellement � mon
cr�dit chez Baring fr�res vous appartiendront de fait et de droit,
messieurs. -- Voici un ch�que de pareille somme. �

Un proc�s-verbal du pari fut fait et sign� sur-le-champ par les six
co-int�ress�s. Phileas Fogg �tait demeur� froid. Il n'avait
certainement pas pari� pour gagner, et n'avait engag� ces vingt mille
livres -- la moiti� de sa fortune -- que parce qu'il pr�voyait qu'il
pourrait avoir � d�penser l'autre pour mener � bien ce difficile, pour
ne pas dire inex�cutable projet. Quant � ses adversaires, eux, ils
paraissaient �mus, non pas � cause de la valeur de l'enjeu, mais parce
qu'ils se faisaient une sorte de scrupule de lutter dans ces
conditions.

Sept heures sonnaient alors. On offrit � Mr. Fogg de suspendre le
whist afin qu'il p�t faire ses pr�paratifs de d�part.

� Je suis toujours pr�t ! � r�pondit cet impassible gentleman, et
donnant les cartes :

� Je retourne carreau, dit-il. A vous de jouer, monsieur Stuart. �

                         --------------------
           DANS LEQUEL PHILEAS FOGG STUPEFIE PASSEPARTOUT,
                            SON DOMESTIQUE

A sept heures vingt-cinq, Phileas Fogg, apr�s avoir gagn� une
vingtaine de guin�es au whist, prit cong� de ses honorables coll�gues,
et quitta le Reform-Club. A sept heures cinquante, il ouvrait la
porte de sa maison et rentrait chez lui.

Passepartout, qui avait consciencieusement �tudi� son programme, fut
assez surpris en voyant Mr. Fogg, coupable d'inexactitude, appara�tre
� cette heure insolite. Suivant la notice, le locataire de
Saville-row ne devait rentrer qu'� minuit pr�cis.

Phileas Fogg �tait tout d'abord mont� � sa chambre, puis il appela :

� Passepartout. �

Passepartout ne r�pondit pas. Cet appel ne pouvait s'adresser � lui.
Ce n'�tait pas l'heure.

� Passepartout �, reprit Mr. Fogg sans �lever la voix davantage.

Passepartout se montra.

� C'est la deuxi�me fois que je vous appelle, dit Mr. Fogg.

-- Mais il n'est pas minuit, r�pondit Passepartout, sa montre � la
main.

-- Je le sais, reprit Phileas Fogg, et je ne vous fais pas de
reproche. Nous partons dans dix minutes pour Douvres et Calais. �

Une sorte de grimace s'�baucha sur la ronde face du Fran�ais. Il
�tait �vident qu'il avait mal entendu.

� Monsieur se d�place ? demanda-t-il.

-- Oui, r�pondit Phileas Fogg. Nous allons faire le tour du monde. �

Passepartout, l'oeil d�mesur�ment ouvert, la paupi�re et le sourcil
sur�lev�s, les bras d�tendus, le corps affaiss�, pr�sentait alors tous
les sympt�mes de l'�tonnement pouss� jusqu'� la stupeur.

� Le tour du monde ! murmura-t-il.

-- En quatre-vingts jours, r�pondit Mr. Fogg. Ainsi, nous n'avons
pas un instant � perdre.

-- Mais les malles ?... dit Passepartout, qui balan�ait
inconsciemment sa t�te de droite et de gauche

-- Pas de malles. Un sac de nuit seulement. Dedans, deux chemises de
laine, trois paires de bas. Autant pour vous. Nous ach�terons en
route. Vous descendrez mon mackintosh et ma couverture de voyage.
Ayez de bonnes chaussures. D'ailleurs, nous marcherons peu ou pas.
Allez. �

Passepartout aurait voulu r�pondre. Il ne put. Il quitta la chambre
de Mr. Fogg, monta dans la sienne, tomba sur une chaise, et employant
une phrase assez vulgaire de son pays :

� Ah ! bien se dit-il, elle est forte, celle-l�! Moi qui voulais
rester tranquille !... �

Et, machinalement, il fit ses pr�paratifs de d�part. Le tour du monde
en quatre-vingts jours ! Avait-il affaire � un fou ? Non... C'�tait
une plaisanterie ? On allait � Douvres, bien. A Calais, soit. Apr�s
tout, cela ne pouvait notablement contrarier le brave gar�on, qui,
depuis cinq ans, n'avait pas foul� le sol de la patrie. Peut-�tre
m�me irait-on jusqu'� Paris, et, ma foi, il reverrait avec plaisir la
grande capitale. Mais, certainement, un gentleman aussi m�nager de
ses pas s'arr�terait l�... Oui, sans doute, mais il n'en �tait pas
moins vrai qu'il partait, qu'il se d�pla�ait, ce gentleman, si
casanier jusqu'alors !

A huit heures, Passepartout avait pr�par� le modeste sac qui contenait
sa garde-robe et celle de son ma�tre ; puis, l'esprit encore troubl�,
il quitta sa chambre, dont il ferma soigneusement la porte, et il
rejoignit Mr. Fogg.

Mr. Fogg �tait pr�t. Il portait sous son bras le _Bradshaw's
continental railway steam transit and general guide_, qui devait lui
fournir toutes les indications n�cessaires � son voyage. Il prit le
sac des mains de Passepartout, l'ouvrit et y glissa une forte liasse
de ces belles bank-notes qui ont cours dans tous les pays.

� Vous n'avez rien oubli� ? demanda-t-il.

-- Rien, monsieur.

-- Mon mackintosh et ma couverture ?

-- Les voici.

-- Bien, prenez ce sac. �

Mr. Fogg remit le sac � Passepartout.

� Et ayez-en soin, ajouta-t-il. Il y a vingt mille livres dedans
(500 000 F). �

Le sac faillit s'�chapper des mains de Passepartout, comme si les
vingt mille livres eussent �t� en or et pes� consid�rablement.

Le ma�tre et le domestique descendirent alors, et la porte de la rue
fut ferm�e � double tour.

Une station de voitures se trouvait � l'extr�mit� de Saville-row.
Phileas Fogg et son domestique mont�rent dans un cab, qui se dirigea
rapidement vers la gare de Charing-Cross, � laquelle aboutit un des
embranchements du South-Eastern-railway.

A huit heures vingt, le cab s'arr�ta devant la grille de la gare.
Passepartout sauta � terre. Son ma�tre le suivit et paya le cocher.

En ce moment, une pauvre mendiante, tenant un enfant � la main, pieds
nus dans la boue, coiff�e d'un chapeau d�penaill� auquel pendait une
plume lamentable, un ch�le en loques sur ses haillons, s'approcha de
Mr. Fogg et lui demanda l'aum�ne.

Mr. Fogg tira de sa poche les vingt guin�es qu'il venait de gagner au
whist, et, les pr�sentant � la mendiante :

� Tenez, ma brave femme, dit-il, je suis content de vous avoir
rencontr�e ! �

Puis il passa.

Passepartout eut comme une sensation d'humidit� autour de la prunelle.
Son ma�tre avait fait un pas dans son coeur.

Mr. Fogg et lui entr�rent aussit�t dans la grande salle de la gare.
L�, Phileas Fogg donna � Passepartout l'ordre de prendre deux billets
de premi�re classe pour Paris. Puis, se retournant, il aper�ut ses
cinq coll�gues du Reform-Club.

� Messieurs, je pars, dit-il, et les divers visas appos�s sur un
passeport que j'emporte � cet effet vous permettront, au retour, de
contr�ler mon itin�raire.

-- Oh ! monsieur Fogg, r�pondit poliment Gauthier Ralph, c'est
inutile. Nous nous en rapporterons � votre honneur de gentleman !

-- Cela vaut mieux ainsi, dit Mr. Fogg.

-- Vous n'oubliez pas que vous devez �tre revenu ?... fit observer
Andrew Stuart.

-- Dans quatre-vingts jours, r�pondit Mr. Fogg, le samedi 21 d�cembre
1872, � huit heures quarante-cinq minutes du soir. Au revoir,
messieurs. �

A huit heures quarante, Phileas Fogg et son domestique prirent place
dans le m�me compartiment. A huit heures quarante-cinq, un coup de
sifflet retentit, et le train se mit en marche.

La nuit �tait noire. Il tombait une pluie fine. Phileas Fogg, accot�
dans son coin, ne parlait pas. Passepartout, encore abasourdi,
pressait machinalement contre lui le sac aux bank-notes.

Mais le train n'avait pas d�pass� Sydenham, que Passepartout poussait
un v�ritable cri de d�sespoir !

� Qu'avez-vous ? demanda Mr. Fogg.

-- Il y a... que... dans ma pr�cipitation... mon trouble... j'ai
oubli�...

-- Quoi ?

-- D'�teindre le bec de gaz de ma chambre !

-- Eh bien, mon gar�on, r�pondit froidement Mr. Fogg, il br�le �
votre compte ! �

                                  V
                         --------------------
               DANS LEQUEL UNE NOUVELLE VALEUR APPARA�T
                       SUR LA PLACE DE LONDRES

Phileas Fogg, en quittant Londres, ne se doutait gu�re, sans doute, du
grand retentissement qu'allait provoquer son d�part. La nouvelle du
pari se r�pandit d'abord dans le Reform-Club, et produisit une
v�ritable �motion parmi les membres de l'honorable cercle. Puis, du
club, cette �motion passa aux journaux par la voie des reporters, et
des journaux au public de Londres et de tout le Royaume-Uni.

Cette � question du tour du monde � fut comment�e, discut�e,
diss�qu�e, avec autant de passion et d'ardeur que s'il se f�t agi
d'une nouvelle affaire de l'_Alabama_. Les uns prirent parti pour
Phileas Fogg, les autres -- et ils form�rent bient�t une majorit�
consid�rable -- se prononc�rent contre lui. Ce tour du monde �
accomplir, autrement qu'en th�orie et sur le papier, dans ce minimum
de temps, avec les moyens de communication actuellement en usage, ce
n'�tait pas seulement impossible, c'�tait insens� !

Le _Times_, le _Standard_, l'_Evening Star_, le _Morning Chronicle_,
et vingt autres journaux de grande publicit�, se d�clar�rent contre
Mr. Fogg. Seul, le _Daily Telegraph_ le soutint dans une certaine
mesure. Phileas Fogg fut g�n�ralement trait� de maniaque, de fou, et
ses coll�gues du Reform-Club furent bl�m�s d'avoir tenu ce pari, qui
accusait un affaiblissement dans les facult�s mentales de son auteur.

Des articles extr�mement passionn�s, mais logiques, parurent sur la
question. On sait l'int�r�t que l'on porte en Angleterre � tout ce
qui touche � la g�ographie. Aussi n'�tait-il pas un lecteur, �
quelque classe qu'il appart�nt, qui ne d�vor�t les colonnes consacr�es
au cas de Phileas Fogg.

Pendant les premiers jours, quelques esprits audacieux -- les femmes
principalement -- furent pour lui, surtout quand l'_Illustrated London
News_ eut publi� son portrait d'apr�s sa photographie d�pos�e aux
archives du Reform-Club. Certains gentlemen osaient dire : � H� !
h� ! pourquoi pas, apr�s tout ? On a vu des choses plus
extraordinaires ! � C'�taient surtout les lecteurs du _Daily
Telegraph_. Mais on sentit bient�t que ce journal lui-m�me commen�ait
� faiblir.

En effet, un long article parut le 7 octobre dans le Bulletin de la
Soci�t� royale de g�ographie. Il traita la question � tous les points
de vue, et d�montra clairement la folie de l'entreprise. D'apr�s cet
article, tout �tait contre le voyageur, obstacles de l'homme,
obstacles de la nature. Pour r�ussir dans ce projet, il fallait
admettre une concordance miraculeuse des heures de d�part et
d'arriv�e, concordance qui n'existait pas, qui ne pouvait pas exister.
A la rigueur, et en Europe, o� il s'agit de parcours d'une longueur
relativement m�diocre, on peut compter sur l'arriv�e des trains �
heure fixe ; mais quand ils emploient trois jours � traverser l'Inde,
sept jours � traverser les �tats-Unis, pouvait-on fonder sur leur
exactitude les �l�ments d'un tel probl�me ? Et les accidents de
machine, les d�raillements, les rencontres, la mauvaise saison,
l'accumulation des neiges, est-ce que tout n'�tait pas contre Phileas
Fogg ? Sur les paquebots, ne se trouverait-il pas, pendant l'hiver, �
la merci des coups de vent ou des brouillards ? Est-il donc si rare
que les meilleurs marcheurs des lignes transoc�aniennes �prouvent des
retards de deux ou trois jours ? Or, il suffisait d'un retard, un
seul, pour que la cha�ne de communications f�t irr�parablement bris�e.
Si Phileas Fogg manquait, ne f�t-ce que de quelques heures, le d�part
d'un paquebot, il serait forc� d'attendre le paquebot suivant, et par
cela m�me son voyage �tait compromis irr�vocablement.

L'article fit grand bruit. Presque tous les journaux le
reproduisirent, et les actions de Phileas Fogg baiss�rent
singuli�rement.

Pendant les premiers jours qui suivirent le d�part du gentleman,
d'importantes affaires s'�taient engag�es sur � l'al�a � de son
entreprise. On sait ce qu'est le monde des parieurs en Angleterre,
monde plus intelligent, plus relev� que celui des joueurs. Parier est
dans le temp�rament anglais. Aussi, non seulement les divers membres
du Reform-Club �tablirent-ils des paris consid�rables pour ou contre
Phileas Fogg, mais la masse du public entra dans le mouvement.
Phileas Fogg fut inscrit comme un cheval de course, � une sorte de
studbook. On en fit aussi une valeur de bourse, qui fut imm�diatement
cot�e sur la place de Londres. On demandait, on offrait du � Phileas
Fogg � ferme ou � prime, et il se fit des affaires �normes. Mais cinq
jours apr�s son d�part, apr�s l'article du Bulletin de la Soci�t� de
g�ographie, les offres commenc�rent � affluer. Le Phileas Fogg
baissa. On l'offrit par paquets. Pris d'abord � cinq, puis � dix, on
ne le prit plus qu'� vingt, � cinquante, � cent !

Un seul partisan lui resta. Ce fut le vieux paralytique, Lord
Albermale. L'honorable gentleman, clou� sur son fauteuil, e�t donn�
sa fortune pour pouvoir faire le tour du monde, m�me en dix ans ! et
il paria cinq mille livres (100 000 F) en faveur de Phileas Fogg. Et
quand, en m�me temps que la sottise du projet, on lui en d�montrait
l'inutilit�, il se contentait de r�pondre : � Si la chose est
faisable, il est bon que ce soit un Anglais qui le premier l'ait
faite ! �

Or, on en �tait l�, les partisans de Phileas Fogg se rar�fiaient de
plus en plus ; tout le monde, et non sans raison, se mettait contre
lui ; on ne le prenait plus qu'� cent cinquante, � deux cents contre
un, quand, sept jours apr�s son d�part, un incident, compl�tement
inattendu, fit qu'on ne le prit plus du tout.

En effet, pendant cette journ�e, � neuf heures du soir, le directeur
de la police m�tropolitaine avait re�u une d�p�che t�l�graphique ainsi
con�ue :

                                         Suez � Londres.

  _Rowan, directeur police, administration centrale, Scotland place._

 Je file voleur de Banque, Phileas Fogg. Envoyez sans retard mandat
d'arrestation � Bombay (Inde anglaise).

                                         Fix, _d�tective_.

L'effet de cette d�p�che fut imm�diat. L'honorable gentleman disparut
pour faire place au voleur de bank-notes. Sa photographie, d�pos�e au
Reform-Club avec celles de tous ses coll�gues, fut examin�e. Elle
reproduisait trait pour trait l'homme dont le signalement avait �t�
fourni par l'enqu�te. On rappela ce que l'existence de Phileas Fogg
avait de myst�rieux, son isolement, son d�part subit, et il parut
�vident que ce personnage, pr�textant un voyage autour du monde et
l'appuyant sur un pari insens�, n'avait eu d'autre but que de d�pister
les agents de la police anglaise.

                                  VI
                         --------------------
            DANS LEQUEL L'AGENT FIX MONTRE UNE IMPATIENCE
                            BIEN LEGITIME

Voici dans quelles circonstances avait �t� lanc�e cette d�p�che
concernant le sieur Phileas Fogg.

Le mercredi 9 octobre, on attendait pour onze heures du matin, � Suez,
le paquebot _Mongolia_, de la Compagnie p�ninsulaire et orientale,
steamer en fer � h�lice et � spardeck, jaugeant deux mille huit cents
tonnes et poss�dant une force nominale de cinq cents chevaux. Le
_Mongolia_ faisait r�guli�rement les voyages de Brindisi � Bombay par
le canal de Suez. C'�tait un des plus rapides marcheurs de la
Compagnie, et les vitesses r�glementaires, soit dix milles � l'heure
entre Brindisi et Suez, et neuf milles cinquante-trois centi�mes entre
Suez et Bombay, il les avait toujours d�pass�es.

En attendant l'arriv�e du _Mongolia_, deux hommes se promenaient sur
le quai au milieu de la foule d'indig�nes et d'�trangers qui affluent
dans cette ville, nagu�re une bourgade, � laquelle la grande oeuvre de
M. de Lesseps assure un avenir consid�rable.

De ces deux hommes, l'un �tait l'agent consulaire du Royaume-Uni,
�tabli � Suez, qui -- en d�pit des f�cheux pronostics du gouvernement
britannique et des sinistres pr�dictions de l'ing�nieur Stephenson --
voyait chaque jour des navires anglais traverser ce canal, abr�geant
ainsi de moiti� l'ancienne route de l'Angleterre aux Indes par le cap
de Bonne-Esp�rance.

L'autre �tait un petit homme maigre, de figure assez intelligente,
nerveux, qui contractait avec une persistance remarquable ses muscles
sourciliers. A travers ses longs cils brillait un oeil tr�s vif, mais
dont il savait � volont� �teindre l'ardeur. En ce moment, il donnait
certaines marques d'impatience, allant, venant, ne pouvant tenir en
place.

Cet homme se nommait Fix, et c'�tait un de ces � d�tectives � ou
agents de police anglais, qui avaient �t� envoy�s dans les divers
ports, apr�s le vol commis � la Banque d'Angleterre. Ce Fix devait
surveiller avec le plus grand soin tous les voyageurs prenant la route
de Suez, et si l'un d'eux lui semblait suspect, le � filer � en
attendant un mandat d'arrestation.

Pr�cis�ment, depuis deux jours, Fix avait re�u du directeur de la
police m�tropolitaine le signalement de l'auteur pr�sum� du vol.
C'�tait celui de ce personnage distingu� et bien mis que l'on avait
observ� dans la salle des paiements de la Banque.

Le d�tective, tr�s all�ch� �videmment par la forte prime promise en
cas de succ�s, attendait donc avec une impatience facile � comprendre
l'arriv�e du _Mongolia_.

� Et vous dites, monsieur le consul, demanda-t-il pour la dixi�me
fois, que ce bateau ne peut tarder ?

-- Non, monsieur Fix, r�pondit le consul. Il a �t� signal� hier au
large de Port-Sa�d, et les cent soixante kilom�tres du canal ne
comptent pas pour un tel marcheur. Je vous r�p�te que le _Mongolia_ a
toujours gagn� la prime de vingt-cinq livres que le gouvernement
accorde pour chaque avance de vingt-quatre heures sur les temps
r�glementaires.

-- Ce paquebot vient directement de Brindisi ? demanda Fix.

-- De Brindisi m�me, o� il a pris la malle des Indes, de Brindisi
qu'il a quitt� samedi � cinq heures du soir. Ainsi ayez patience, il
ne peut tarder � arriver. Mais je ne sais vraiment pas comment, avec
le signalement que vous avez re�u, vous pourrez reconna�tre votre
homme, s'il est � bord du _Mongolia_.

-- Monsieur le consul, r�pondit Fix, ces gens-l�, on les sent plut�t
qu'on ne les reconna�t. C'est du flair qu'il faut avoir, et le flair
est comme un sens sp�cial auquel concourent l'ou�e, la vue et
l'odorat. J'ai arr�t� dans ma vie plus d'un de ces gentlemen, et
pourvu que mon voleur soit � bord, je vous r�ponds qu'il ne me
glissera pas entre les mains.

-- Je le souhaite, monsieur Fix, car il s'agit d'un vol important.

-- Un vol magnifique, r�pondit l'agent enthousiasm�. Cinquante-cinq
mille livres ! Nous n'avons pas souvent de pareilles aubaines ! Les
voleurs deviennent mesquins ! La race des Sheppard s'�tiole ! On se
fait pendre maintenant pour quelques shillings !

-- Monsieur Fix, r�pondit le consul, vous parlez d'une telle fa�on que
je vous souhaite vivement de r�ussir ; mais, je vous le r�p�te, dans
les conditions o� vous �tes, je crains que ce ne soit difficile.
Savez-vous bien que, d'apr�s le signalement que vous avez re�u, ce
voleur ressemble absolument � un honn�te homme.

-- Monsieur le consul, r�pondit dogmatiquement l'inspecteur de police,
les grands voleurs ressemblent toujours � d'honn�tes gens. Vous
comprenez bien que ceux qui ont des figures de coquins n'ont qu'un
parti � prendre, c'est de rester probes, sans cela ils se feraient
arr�ter. Les physionomies honn�tes, ce sont celles-l� qu'il faut
d�visager surtout. Travail difficile, j'en conviens, et qui n'est
plus du m�tier, mais de l'art. �

On voit que ledit Fix ne manquait pas d'une certaine dose
d'amour-propre.

Cependant le quai s'animait peu � peu. Marins de diverses
nationalit�s, commer�ants, courtiers, portefaix, fellahs, y
affluaient. L'arriv�e du paquebot �tait �videmment prochaine.

Le temps �tait assez beau, mais l'air froid, par ce vent d'est.
Quelques minarets se dessinaient au-dessus de la ville sous les p�les
rayons du soleil. Vers le sud, une jet�e longue de deux mille m�tres
s'allongeait comme un bras sur la rade de Suez. A la surface de la
mer Rouge roulaient plusieurs bateaux de p�che ou de cabotage, dont
quelques-uns ont conserv� dans leurs fa�ons l'�l�gant gabarit de la
gal�re antique.

Tout en circulant au milieu de ce populaire, Fix, par une habitude de
sa profession, d�visageait les passants d'un rapide coup d'oeil.

Il �tait alors dix heures et demie.

� Mais il n'arrivera pas, ce paquebot ! s'�cria-t-il en entendant
sonner l'horloge du port.

-- Il ne peut �tre �loign�, r�pondit le consul.

-- Combien de temps stationnera-t-il � Suez ? demanda Fix.

-- Quatre heures. Le temps d'embarquer son charbon. De Suez � Aden,
� l'extr�mit� de la mer Rouge, on compte treize cent dix milles, et il
faut faire provision de combustible.

-- Et de Suez, ce bateau va directement � Bombay ? demanda Fix.

-- Directement, sans rompre charge.

-- Eh bien, dit Fix, si le voleur a pris cette route et ce bateau, il
doit entrer dans son plan de d�barquer � Suez, afin de gagner par une
autre voie les possessions hollandaises ou fran�aises de l'Asie. Il
doit bien savoir qu'il ne serait pas en s�ret� dans l'Inde, qui est
une terre anglaise.

-- A moins que ce ne soit un homme tr�s fort, r�pondit le consul.
Vous le savez, un criminel anglais est toujours mieux cach� � Londres
qu'il ne le serait � l'�tranger. �

Sur cette r�flexion, qui donna fort � r�fl�chir � l'agent, le consul
regagna ses bureaux, situ�s � peu de distance. L'inspecteur de police
demeura seul, pris d'une impatience nerveuse, avec ce pressentiment
assez bizarre que son voleur devait se trouver � bord du _Mongolia_,
-- et en v�rit�, si ce coquin avait quitt� l'Angleterre avec
l'intention de gagner le Nouveau Monde, la route des Indes, moins
surveill�e ou plus difficile � surveiller que celle de l'Atlantique,
devait avoir obtenu sa pr�f�rence.

Fix ne fut pas longtemps livr� � ses r�flexions. De vifs coups de
sifflet annonc�rent l'arriv�e du paquebot. Toute la horde des
portefaix et des fellahs se pr�cipita vers le quai dans un tumulte un
peu inqui�tant pour les membres et les v�tements des passagers. Une
dizaine de canots se d�tach�rent de la rive et all�rent au-devant du
_Mongolia_.

Bient�t on aper�ut la gigantesque coque du _Mongolia_, passant entre
les rives du canal, et onze heures sonnaient quand le steamer vint
mouiller en rade, pendant que sa vapeur fusait � grand bruit par les
tuyaux d'�chappement.

Les passagers �taient assez nombreux � bord. Quelques-uns rest�rent
sur le spardeck � contempler le panorama pittoresque de la ville ;
mais la plupart d�barqu�rent dans les canots qui �taient venus
accoster le _Mongolia_.

Fix examinait scrupuleusement tous ceux qui mettaient pied � terre.

En ce moment, l'un d'eux s'approcha de lui, apr�s avoir vigoureusement
repouss� les fellahs qui l'assaillaient de leurs offres de service, et
il lui demanda fort poliment s'il pouvait lui indiquer les bureaux de
l'agent consulaire anglais. Et en m�me temps ce passager pr�sentait
un passeport sur lequel il d�sirait sans doute faire apposer le visa
britannique.

Fix, instinctivement, prit le passeport, et, d'un rapide coup d'oeil,
il en lut le signalement.

Un mouvement involontaire faillit lui �chapper. La feuille trembla
dans sa main. Le signalement libell� sur le passeport �tait identique
� celui qu'il avait re�u du directeur de la police m�tropolitaine.

� Ce passeport n'est pas le v�tre ? dit-il au passager.

-- Non, r�pondit celui-ci, c'est le passeport de mon ma�tre.

-- Et votre ma�tre ?

-- Il est rest� � bord.

-- Mais, reprit l'agent, il faut qu'il se pr�sente en personne aux
bureaux du consulat afin d'�tablir son identit�.

-- Quoi ! cela est n�cessaire ?

-- Indispensable.

-- Et o� sont ces bureaux ?

-- L�, au coin de la place, r�pondit l'inspecteur en indiquant une
maison �loign�e de deux cents pas.

-- Alors, je vais aller chercher mon ma�tre, � qui pourtant cela ne
plaira gu�re de se d�ranger ! �

L�-dessus, le passager salua Fix et retourna � bord du steamer.

                                 VII
                         --------------------
           QUI T�MOIGNE UNE FOIS DE PLUS DE L'INUTILIT� DES
                   PASSEPORTS EN MATI�RE DE POLICE

L'inspecteur redescendit sur le quai et se dirigea rapidement vers les
bureaux du consul. Aussit�t, et sur sa demande pressante, il fut
introduit pr�s de ce fonctionnaire.

� Monsieur le consul, lui dit-il sans autre pr�ambule, j'ai de fortes
pr�somptions de croire que notre homme a pris passage � bord du
_Mongolia_. �

Et Fix raconta ce qui s'�tait pass� entre ce domestique et lui �
propos du passeport.

� Bien, monsieur Fix, r�pondit le consul, je ne serais pas f�ch� de
voir la figure de ce coquin. Mais peut-�tre ne se pr�sentera-t-il pas
� mon bureau, s'il est ce que vous supposez. Un voleur n'aime pas �
laisser derri�re lui des traces de son passage, et d'ailleurs la
formalit� des passeports n'est plus obligatoire.

-- Monsieur le consul, r�pondit l'agent, si c'est un homme fort comme
on doit le penser, il viendra !

-- Faire viser son passeport ?

-- Oui. Les passeports ne servent jamais qu'� g�ner les honn�tes gens
et � favoriser la fuite des coquins. Je vous affirme que celui-ci
sera en r�gle, mais j'esp�re bien que vous ne le viserez pas...

-- Et pourquoi pas ? Si ce passeport est r�gulier, r�pondit le
consul, je n'ai pas le droit de refuser mon visa.

-- Cependant, monsieur le consul, il faut bien que je retienne ici cet
homme jusqu'� ce que j'aie re�u de Londres un mandat d'arrestation.

-- Ah ! cela, monsieur Fix, c'est votre affaire, r�pondit le consul,
mais moi, je ne puis... �

Le consul n'acheva pas sa phrase. En ce moment, on frappait � la
porte de son cabinet, et le gar�on de bureau introduisit deux
�trangers, dont l'un �tait pr�cis�ment ce domestique qui s'�tait
entretenu avec le d�tective.

C'�taient, en effet, le ma�tre et le serviteur. Le ma�tre pr�senta
son passeport, en priant laconiquement le consul de vouloir bien y
apposer son visa.

Celui-ci prit le passeport et le lut attentivement, tandis que Fix,
dans un coin du cabinet, observait ou plut�t d�vorait l'�tranger des
yeux.

Quand le consul eut achev� sa lecture :

� Vous �tes Phileas Fogg, esquire ? demanda-t-il.

-- Oui, monsieur, r�pondit le gentleman.

-- Et cet homme est votre domestique ?

-- Oui. Un Fran�ais nomm� Passepartout.

-- Vous venez de Londres ?

-- Oui.

-- Et vous allez ?

-- A Bombay.

-- Bien, monsieur. Vous savez que cette formalit� du visa est
inutile, et que nous n'exigeons plus la pr�sentation du passeport ?

-- Je le sais, monsieur, r�pondit Phileas Fogg, mais je d�sire
constater par votre visa mon passage � Suez.

-- Soit, monsieur. �

Et le consul, ayant sign� et dat� le passeport, y apposa son cachet.
Mr. Fogg acquitta les droits de visa, et, apr�s avoir froidement
salu�, il sortit, suivi de son domestique.

� Eh bien ? demanda l'inspecteur.

-- Eh bien, r�pondit le consul, il a l'air d'un parfait honn�te
homme !

-- Possible, r�pondit Fix, mais ce n'est point ce dont il s'agit.
Trouvez-vous, monsieur le consul, que ce flegmatique gentleman
ressemble trait pour trait au voleur dont j'ai re�u le signalement ?

-- J'en conviens, mais vous le savez, tous les signalements...

-- J'en aurai le coeur net, r�pondit Fix. Le domestique me para�t
�tre moins ind�chiffrable que le ma�tre. De plus, c'est un Fran�ais,
qui ne pourra se retenir de parler. A bient�t, monsieur le consul. �

Cela dit, l'agent sortit et se mit � la recherche de Passepartout.

Cependant Mr. Fogg, en quittant la maison consulaire, s'�tait dirig�
vers le quai. L�, il donna quelques ordres � son domestique ; puis il
s'embarqua dans un canot, revint � bord du _Mongolia_ et rentra dans
sa cabine. Il prit alors son carnet, qui portait les notes
suivantes :

� Quitt� Londres, mercredi 2 octobre, 8 heures 45 soir.

� Arriv� � Paris, jeudi 3 octobre, 7 heures 20 matin.

� Quitt� Paris, jeudi, 8 heures 40 matin.

� Arriv� par le Mont-Cenis � Turin, vendredi 4 octobre, 6 heures 35
matin.

� Quitt� Turin, vendredi, 7 heures 20 matin.

� Arriv� � Brindisi, samedi 5 octobre, 4 heures soir.

� Embarqu� sur le _Mongolia_, samedi, 5 heures soir.

� Arriv� � Suez, mercredi 9 octobre, 11 heures matin.

� Total des heures d�pens�es : 158 1/2, soit en jours : 6 jours 1/2. �

Mr. Fogg inscrivit ces dates sur un itin�raire dispos� par colonnes,
qui indiquait -- depuis le 2 octobre jusqu'au 21 d�cembre -- le mois,
le quanti�me, le jour, les arriv�es r�glementaires et les arriv�es
effectives en chaque point principal, Paris, Brindisi, Suez, Bombay,
Calcutta, Singapore, Hong-Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco, New York,
Liverpool, Londres, et qui permettait de chiffrer le gain obtenu o� la
perte �prouv�e � chaque endroit du parcours.

Ce m�thodique itin�raire tenait ainsi compte de tout, et Mr. Fogg
savait toujours s'il �tait en avance ou en retard.

Il inscrivit donc, ce jour-l�, mercredi 9 octobre, son arriv�e � Suez,
qui, concordant avec l'arriv�e r�glementaire, ne le constituait ni en
gain ni en perte.

Puis il se fit servir � d�jeuner dans sa cabine. Quant � voir la
ville, il n'y pensait m�me pas, �tant de cette race d'Anglais qui font
visiter par leur domestique les pays qu'ils traversent.

                                 VIII
                         --------------------
              DANS LEQUEL PASSEPARTOUT PARLE UN PEU PLUS
                   PEUT-�TRE QU'IL NE CONVIENDRAIT


Fix avait en peu d'instants rejoint sur le quai Passepartout, qui
fl�nait et regardait, ne se croyant pas, lui, oblig� � ne point voir.

� Eh bien, mon ami, lui dit Fix en l'abordant, votre passeport est-il
vis� ?

-- Ah ! c'est vous, monsieur, r�pondit le Fran�ais. Bien oblig�.
Nous sommes parfaitement en r�gle.

-- Et vous regardez le pays ?

-- Oui, mais nous allons si vite qu'il me semble que je voyage en
r�ve. Et comme cela, nous sommes � Suez ?

-- A Suez.

-- En �gypte ?

-- En �gypte, parfaitement.

-- Et en Afrique ?

-- En Afrique.

-- En Afrique ! r�p�ta Passepartout. Je ne peux y croire.
Figurez-vous, monsieur, que je m'imaginais ne pas aller plus loin que
Paris, et cette fameuse capitale, je l'ai revue tout juste de sept
heures vingt du matin � huit heures quarante, entre la gare du Nord et
la gare de Lyon, � travers les vitres d'un fiacre et par une pluie
battante ! Je le regrette ! J'aurais aim� � revoir le P�re-Lachaise
et le Cirque des Champs-�lys�es !

-- Vous �tes donc bien press� ? demanda l'inspecteur de police.

-- Moi, non, mais c'est mon ma�tre. A propos, il faut que j'ach�te
des chaussettes et des chemises ! Nous sommes partis sans malles,
avec un sac de nuit seulement.

-- Je vais vous conduire � un bazar o� vous trouverez tout ce qu'il
faut.

-- Monsieur, r�pondit Passepartout, vous �tes vraiment d'une
complaisance !... �

Et tous deux se mirent en route. Passepartout causait toujours.

� Surtout, dit-il, que je prenne bien garde de ne pas manquer le
bateau !

-- Vous avez le temps, r�pondit Fix, il n'est encore que midi ! �

Passepartout tira sa grosse montre.

� Midi, dit-il. Allons donc ! il est neuf heures cinquante-deux
minutes !

-- Votre montre retarde, r�pondit Fix.

-- Ma montre ! Une montre de famille, qui vient de mon
arri�re-grand-p�re ! Elle ne varie pas de cinq minutes par an. C'est
un vrai chronom�tre !

-- Je vois ce que c'est, r�pondit Fix. Vous avez gard� l'heure de
Londres, qui retarde de deux heures environ sur Suez. Il faut avoir
soin de remettre votre montre au midi de chaque pays.

-- Moi ! toucher � ma montre ! s'�cria Passepartout, jamais !

-- Eh bien, elle ne sera plus d'accord avec le soleil.

-- Tant pis pour le soleil, monsieur ! C'est lui qui aura tort ! �

Et le brave gar�on remit sa montre dans sou gousset avec un geste
superbe.

Quelques instants apr�s, Fix lui disait :

� Vous avez donc quitt� Londres pr�cipitamment ?

-- Je le crois bien ! Mercredi dernier, � huit heures du soir, contre
toutes ses habitudes, Mr. Fogg revint de son cercle, et trois quarts
d'heure apr�s nous �tions partis.

-- Mais o� va-t-il donc, votre ma�tre ?

-- Toujours devant lui ! Il fait le tour du monde !

-- Le tour du monde ? s'�cria Fix.

-- Oui, en quatre-vingts jours ! Un pari, dit-il, mais, entre nous,
je n'en crois rien. Cela n'aurait pas le sens commun. Il y a autre
chose.

-- Ah ! c'est un original, ce Mr. Fogg ?

-- Je le crois.

-- Il est donc riche ?

-- �videmment, et il emporte une jolie somme avec lui, en bank-notes
toutes neuves ! Et il n'�pargne pas l'argent en route ! Tenez ! il
a promis une prime magnifique au m�canicien du _Mongolia_, si nous
arrivons � Bombay avec une belle avance !

-- Et vous le connaissez depuis longtemps, votre ma�tre ?

-- Moi ! r�pondit Passepartout, je suis entr� � son service le jour
m�me de notre d�part. �

On s'imagine ais�ment l'effet que ces r�ponses devaient produire sur
l'esprit d�j� surexcit� de l'inspecteur de police.

Ce d�part pr�cipit� de Londres, peu de temps apr�s le vol, cette
grosse somme emport�e, cette h�te d'arriver en des pays lointains, ce
pr�texte d'un pari excentrique, tout confirmait et devait confirmer
Fix dans ses id�es. Il fit encore parler le Fran�ais et acquit la
certitude que ce gar�on ne connaissait aucunement son ma�tre, que
celui-ci vivait isol� � Londres, qu'on le disait riche sans savoir
l'origine de sa fortune, que c'�tait un homme imp�n�trable, etc.
Mais, en m�me temps, Fix put tenir pour certain que Phileas Fogg ne
d�barquait point � Suez, et qu'il allait r�ellement � Bombay.

� Est-ce loin Bombay ? demanda Passepartout.

-- Assez loin, r�pondit l'agent. Il vous faut encore une dizaine de
jours de mer.

-- Et o� prenez-vous Bombay ?

-- Dans l'Inde.

-- En Asie ?

-- Naturellement.

-- Diable ! C'est que je vais vous dire... il y a une chose qui me
tracasse... c'est mon bec !

-- Quel bec ?

-- Mon bec de gaz que j'ai oubli� d'�teindre et qui br�le � mon
compte. Or, j'ai calcul� que j'en avais pour deux shillings par
vingt-quatre heures, juste six pence de plus que je ne gagne, et vous
comprenez que pour peu que le voyage se prolonge... �

Fix comprit-il l'affaire du gaz ? C'est peu probable. Il n'�coutait
plus et prenait un parti. Le Fran�ais et lui �taient arriv�s au
bazar. Fix laissa son compagnon y faire ses emplettes, il lui
recommanda de ne pas manquer le d�part du _Mongolia_, et il revint en
toute h�te aux bureaux de l'agent consulaire.

Fix, maintenant que sa conviction �tait faite, avait repris tout son
sang-froid.

� Monsieur, dit-il au consul, je n'ai plus aucun doute. Je tiens mon
homme. Il se fait passer pour un excentrique qui veut faire le tour
du monde en quatre-vingts jours.

-- Alors c'est un malin, r�pondit le consul, et il compte revenir �
Londres, apr�s avoir d�pist� toutes les polices des deux continents !

-- Nous verrons bien, r�pondit Fix.

-- Mais ne vous trompez-vous pas ? demanda encore une fois le consul.

-- Je ne me trompe pas.

-- Alors, pourquoi ce voleur a-t-il tenu � faire constater par un visa
son passage � Suez ?

-- Pourquoi ?... je n'en sais rien, monsieur le consul, r�pondit le
d�tective, mais �coutez-moi. �

Et, en quelques mots, il rapporta les points saillants de sa
conversation avec le domestique dudit Fogg.

� En effet, dit le consul, toutes les pr�somptions sont contre cet
homme. Et qu'allez-vous faire ?

-- Lancer une d�p�che � Londres avec demande instante de m'adresser un
mandat d'arrestation � Bombay, m'embarquer sur le _Mongolia_, filer
mon voleur jusqu'aux Indes, et l�, sur cette terre anglaise,
l'accoster poliment, mon mandat � la main et la main sur l'�paule. �

Ces paroles prononc�es froidement, l'agent prit cong� du consul et se
rendit au bureau t�l�graphique. De l�, il lan�a au directeur de la
police m�tropolitaine cette d�p�che que l'on conna�t.

Un quart d'heure plus tard, Fix, son l�ger bagage � la main, bien muni
d'argent, d'ailleurs, s'embarquait � bord du _Mongolia_, et bient�t le
rapide steamer filait � toute vapeur sur les eaux de la mer Rouge.

                                  IX
                         --------------------
           O� LA MER ROUGE ET LA MER DES INDES SE MONTRENT
                PROPICES AUX DESSEINS DE PHILEAS FOGG

La distance entre Suez et Aden est exactement de treize cent dix
milles, et le cahier des charges de la Compagnie alloue � ses
paquebots un laps de temps de cent trente-huit heures pour la
franchir. Le _Mongolia_, dont les feux �taient activement pouss�s,
marchait de mani�re � devancer l'arriv�e r�glementaire.

La plupart des passagers embarqu�s � Brindisi avaient presque tous
l'Inde pour destination. Les uns se rendaient � Bombay, les autres �
Calcutta, mais via Bombay, car depuis qu'un chemin de fer traverse
dans toute sa largeur la p�ninsule indienne, il n'est plus n�cessaire
de doubler la pointe de Ceylan.

Parmi ces passagers du _Mongolia_, on comptait divers fonctionnaires
civils et des officiers de tout grade. De ceux-ci, les uns
appartenaient � l'arm�e britannique proprement dite, les autres
commandaient les troupes indig�nes de cipayes, tous ch�rement
appoint�s, m�me � pr�sent que le gouvernement s'est substitu� aux
droits et aux charges de l'ancienne Compagnie des Indes :
sous-lieutenants � 7 000 F, brigadiers � 60 000, g�n�raux � 100 000.
[Le traitement des fonctionnaires civils est encore plus �lev�. Les
simples assistants, au premier degr� de la hi�rarchie, ont 12 000
francs ; les juges, 60 000 F; les pr�sidents de cour, 250 000 F; les
gouverneurs, 300 000 F, et le gouverneur g�n�ral, plus de 600 000 F.
(Note de l'auteur).]

On vivait donc bien � bord du _Mongolia_, dans cette soci�t� de
fonctionnaires, auxquels se m�laient quelques jeunes Anglais, qui, le
million en poche, allaient fonder au loin des comptoirs de commerce.
Le � purser �, l'homme de confiance de la Compagnie, l'�gal du
capitaine � bord, faisait somptueusement les choses. Au d�jeuner du
matin, au lunch de deux heures, au d�ner de cinq heures et demie, au
souper de huit heures, les tables pliaient sous les plats de viande
fra�che et les entremets fournis par la boucherie et les offices du
paquebot. Les passag�res -- il y en avait quelques-unes --
changeaient de toilette deux fois par jour. On faisait de la musique,
on dansait m�me, quand la mer le permettait.

Mais la mer Rouge est fort capricieuse et trop souvent mauvaise, comme
tous ces golfes �troits et longs. Quand le vent soufflait soit de la
c�te d'Asie, soit de la c�te d'Afrique, le _Mongolia_, long fuseau �
h�lice, pris par le travers, roulait �pouvantablement. Les dames
disparaissaient alors ; les pianos se taisaient ; chants et danses
cessaient � la fois. Et pourtant, malgr� la rafale, malgr� la houle,
le paquebot, pouss� par sa puissante machine, courait sans retard vers
le d�troit de Bab-el-Mandeb.

Que faisait Phileas Fogg pendant ce temps ? On pourrait croire que,
toujours inquiet et anxieux, il se pr�occupait des changements de vent
nuisibles � la marche du navire, des mouvements d�sordonn�s de la
houle qui risquaient d'occasionner un accident � la machine, enfin de
toutes les avaries possibles qui, en obligeant le _Mongolia_ �
rel�cher dans quelque port, auraient compromis son voyage ?

Aucunement, ou tout au moins, si ce gentleman songeait � ces
�ventualit�s, il n'en laissait rien para�tre. C'�tait toujours
l'homme impassible, le membre imperturbable du Reform-Club, qu'aucun
incident ou accident ne pouvait surprendre. Il ne paraissait pas plus
�mu que les chronom�tres du bord. On le voyait rarement sur le pont.
Il s'inqui�tait peu d'observer cette mer Rouge, si f�conde en
souvenirs, ce th��tre des premi�res sc�nes historiques de l'humanit�.
Il ne venait pas reconna�tre les curieuses villes sem�es sur ses
bords, et dont la pittoresque silhouette se d�coupait quelquefois �
l'horizon. Il ne r�vait m�me pas aux dangers de ce golfe Arabique,
dont les anciens historiens, Strabon, Arrien, Arth�midore, Edrisi, ont
toujours parl� avec �pouvante, et sur lequel les navigateurs ne se
hasardaient jamais autrefois sans avoir consacr� leur voyage par des
sacrifices propitiatoires.

Que faisait donc cet original, emprisonn� dans le _Mongolia_ ?
D'abord il faisait ses quatre repas par jour, sans que jamais ni
roulis ni tangage pussent d�traquer une machine si merveilleusement
organis�e. Puis il jouait au whist.

Oui ! il avait rencontr� des partenaires, aussi enrag�s que lui : un
collecteur de taxes qui se rendait � son poste � Goa, un ministre, le
r�v�rend D�cimus Smith, retournant � Bombay, et un brigadier g�n�ral
de l'arm�e anglaise, qui rejoignait son corps � B�nar�s. Ces trois
passagers avaient pour le whist la m�me passion que Mr. Fogg, et ils
jouaient pendant des heures enti�res, non moins silencieusement que
lui.

Quant � Passepartout, le mal de mer n'avait aucune prise sur lui. Il
occupait une cabine � l'avant et mangeait, lui aussi,
consciencieusement. Il faut dire que, d�cid�ment, ce voyage, fait
dans ces conditions, ne lui d�plaisait plus. Il en prenait son parti.
Bien nourri, bien log�, il voyait du pays et d'ailleurs il s'affirmait
� lui-m�me que toute cette fantaisie finirait � Bombay.

Le lendemain du d�part de Suez, le 10 octobre, ce ne fut pas sans un
certain plaisir qu'il rencontra sur le pont l'obligeant personnage
auquel il s'�tait adress� en d�barquant en �gypte.

� Je ne me trompe pas, dit-il en l'abordant avec son plus aimable
sourire, c'est bien vous, monsieur, qui m'avez si complaisamment servi
de guide � Suez ?

-- En effet, r�pondit le d�tective, je vous reconnais ! Vous �tes le
domestique de cet Anglais original...

-- Pr�cis�ment, monsieur... ?

-- Fix.

-- Monsieur Fix, r�pondit Passepartout. Enchant� de vous retrouver �
bord. Et o� allez-vous donc ?

-- Mais, ainsi que vous, � Bombay.

-- C'est au mieux ! Est-ce que vous avez d�j� fait ce voyage ?

-- Plusieurs fois, r�pondit Fix. Je suis un agent de la Compagnie
p�ninsulaire.

-- Alors vous connaissez l'Inde ?

-- Mais... oui..., r�pondit Fix, qui ne voulait pas trop s'avancer.

-- Et c'est curieux, cette Inde-l� ?

-- Tr�s curieux ! Des mosqu�es, des minarets, des temples, des
fakirs, des pagodes, des tigres, des serpents, des bayad�res ! Mais
il faut esp�rer que vous aurez le temps de visiter le pays ?

-- Je l'esp�re, monsieur Fix. Vous comprenez bien qu'il n'est pas
permis � un homme sain d'esprit de passer sa vie � sauter d'un
paquebot dans un chemin de fer et d'un chemin de fer dans un paquebot,
sous pr�texte de faire le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours ! Non.
Toute cette gymnastique cessera � Bombay, n'en doutez pas.

-- Et il se porte bien, Mr. Fogg ? demanda Fix du ton le plus
naturel.

-- Tr�s bien, monsieur Fix. Moi aussi, d'ailleurs. Je mange comme un
ogre qui serait � jeun. C'est l'air de la mer.

-- Et votre ma�tre, je ne le vois jamais sur le pont.

-- Jamais. Il n'est pas curieux.

-- Savez-vous, monsieur Passepartout, que ce pr�tendu voyage en
quatre-vingts jours pourrait bien cacher quelque mission secr�te...
une mission diplomatique, par exemple !

-- Ma foi, monsieur Fix, je n'en sais rien, je vous l'avoue, et, au
fond, je ne donnerais pas une demi-couronne pour le savoir. �

Depuis cette rencontre, Passepartout et Fix caus�rent souvent
ensemble. L'inspecteur de police tenait � se lier avec le domestique
du sieur Fogg. Cela pouvait le servir � l'occasion. Il lui offrait
donc souvent, au bar-room du _Mongolia_, quelques verres de whisky ou
de pale-ale, que le brave gar�on acceptait sans c�r�monie et rendait
m�me pour ne pas �tre en reste, -- trouvant, d'ailleurs, ce Fix un
gentleman bien honn�te.

Cependant le paquebot s'avan�ait rapidement. Le 13, on eut
connaissance de Moka, qui apparut dans sa ceinture de murailles
ruin�es, au-dessus desquelles se d�tachaient quelques dattiers
verdoyants. Au loin, dans les montagnes, se d�veloppaient de vastes
champs de caf�iers. Passepartout fut ravi de contempler cette ville
c�l�bre, et il trouva m�me qu'avec ces murs circulaires et un fort
d�mantel� qui se dessinait comme une anse, elle ressemblait � une
�norme demi-tasse.

Pendant la nuit suivante, le _Mongolia_ franchit le d�troit de
Bab-el-Mandeb, dont le nom arabe signifie _la Porte des Larmes_, et le
lendemain, 14, il faisait escale � Steamer-Point, au nord-ouest de la
rade d'Aden. C'est l� qu'il devait se r�approvisionner de
combustible.

Grave et importante affaire que cette alimentation du foyer des
paquebots � de telles distances des centres de production. Rien que
pour la Compagnie p�ninsulaire, c'est une d�pense annuelle qui se
chiffre par huit cent mille livres (20 millions de francs). Il a
fallu, en effet, �tablir des d�p�ts en plusieurs ports, et, dans ces
mers �loign�es, le charbon revient � quatre-vingts francs la tonne.

Le _Mongolia_ avait encore seize cent cinquante milles � faire avant
d'atteindre Bombay, et il devait rester quatre heures � Steamer-Point,
afin de remplir ses soutes.

Mais ce retard ne pouvait nuire en aucune fa�on au programme de
Phileas Fogg. Il �tait pr�vu. D'ailleurs le _Mongolia_, au lieu
d'arriver � Aden le 15 octobre seulement au matin, y entrait le 14 au
soir. C'�tait un gain de quinze heures.

Mr. Fogg et son domestique descendirent � terre. Le gentleman
voulait faire viser son passeport. Fix le suivit sans �tre remarqu�.
La formalit� du visa accomplie, Phileas Fogg revint � bord reprendre
sa partie interrompue.

Passepartout, lui, fl�na, suivant sa coutume, au milieu de cette
population de Somanlis, de Banians, de Parsis, de Juifs, d'Arabes,
d'Europ�ens, composant les vingt-cinq mille habitants d'Aden. Il
admira les fortifications qui font de cette ville le Gibraltar de la
mer des Indes, et de magnifiques citernes auxquelles travaillaient
encore les ing�nieurs anglais, deux mille ans apr�s les ing�nieurs du
roi Salomon.

� Tr�s curieux, tr�s curieux ! se disait Passepartout en revenant �
bord. Je m'aper�ois qu'il n'est pas inutile de voyager, si l'on veut
voir du nouveau. �

A six heures du soir, le _Mongolia_ battait des branches de son h�lice
les eaux de la rade d'Aden et courait bient�t sur la mer des Indes.
Il lui �tait accord� cent soixante-huit heures pour accomplir la
travers�e entre Aden et Bombay. Du reste, cette mer indienne lui fut
favorable. Le vent tenait dans le nord-ouest. Les voiles vinrent en
aide � la vapeur.

Le navire, mieux appuy�, roula moins. Les passag�res, en fra�ches
toilettes, reparurent sur le pont. Les chants et les danses
recommenc�rent.

Le voyage s'accomplit donc dans les meilleures conditions.
Passepartout �tait enchant� de l'aimable compagnon que le hasard lui
avait procur� en la personne de Fix.

Le dimanche 20 octobre, vers midi, on eut connaissance de la c�te
indienne. Deux heures plus tard, le pilote montait � bord du
_Mongolia_. A l'horizon, un arri�re-plan de collines se profilait
harmonieusement sur le fond du ciel. Bient�t, les rangs de palmiers
qui couvrent la ville se d�tach�rent vivement. Le paquebot p�n�tra
dans cette rade form�e par les �les Salcette, Colaba, �l�phanta,
Butcher, et � quatre heures et demie il accostait les quais de Bombay.

Phileas Fogg achevait alors le trente-troisi�me robre de la journ�e,
et son partenaire et lui, gr�ce � une manoeuvre audacieuse, ayant fait
les treize lev�es, termin�rent cette belle travers�e par un chelem
admirable.

Le _Mongolia_ ne devait arriver que le 22 octobre � Bombay. Or, il y
arrivait le 20. C'�tait donc, depuis son d�part de Londres, un gain
de deux jours, que Phileas Fogg inscrivit m�thodiquement sur son
itin�raire � la colonne des b�n�fices.

              O� PASSEPARTOUT EST TROP HEUREUX D'EN �TRE
                    QUITTE EN PERDANT SA CHAUSSURE

Personne n'ignore que l'Inde -- ce grand triangle renvers� dont la
base est au nord et la pointe au sud -- comprend une superficie de
quatorze cent mille milles carr�s, sur laquelle est in�galement
r�pandue une population de cent quatre-vingts millions d'habitants.
Le gouvernement britannique exerce une domination r�elle sur une
certaine partie de cet immense pays. Il entretient un gouverneur
g�n�ral � Calcutta, des gouverneurs � Madras, � Bombay, au Bengale, et
un lieutenant-gouverneur � Agra.

Mais l'Inde anglaise proprement dite ne compte qu'une superficie de
sept cent mille milles carr�s et une population de cent � cent dix
millions d'habitants. C'est assez dire qu'une notable partie du
territoire �chappe encore � l'autorit� de la reine ; et, en effet,
chez certains rajahs de l'int�rieur, farouches et terribles,
l'ind�pendance indoue est encore absolue.

Depuis 1756 -- �poque � laquelle fut fond� le premier �tablissement
anglais sur l'emplacement aujourd'hui occup� par la ville de Madras --
jusqu'� cette ann�e dans laquelle �clata la grande insurrection des
cipayes, la c�l�bre Compagnie des Indes fut toute-puissante. Elle
s'annexait peu � peu les diverses provinces, achet�es aux rajahs au
prix de rentes qu'elle payait peu ou point ; elle nommait son
gouverneur g�n�ral et tous ses employ�s civils ou militaires ; mais
maintenant elle n'existe plus, et les possessions anglaises de l'Inde
rel�vent directement de la couronne.

Aussi l'aspect, les moeurs, les divisions ethnographiques de la
p�ninsule tendent � se modifier chaque jour. Autrefois, on y
voyageait par tous les antiques moyens de transport, � pied, � cheval,
en charrette, en brouette, en palanquin, � dos d'homme, en coach, etc.
Maintenant, des steamboats parcourent � grande vitesse l'Indus, le
Gange, et un chemin de fer, qui traverse l'Inde dans toute sa largeur
en se ramifiant sur son parcours, met Bombay � trois jours seulement
de Calcutta.

Le trac� de ce chemin de fer ne suit pas la ligne droite � travers
l'Inde. La distance � vol d'oiseau n'est que de mille � onze cents
milles, et des trains, anim�s d'une vitesse moyenne seulement,
n'emploieraient pas trois jours � la franchir ; mais cette distance
est accrue d'un tiers, au moins, par la corde que d�crit le railway en
s'�levant jusqu'� Allahabad dans le nord de la p�ninsule.

Voici, en somme, le trac� � grands points du � Great Indian peninsular
railway �. En quittant l'�le de Bombay, il traverse Salcette, saute
sur le continent en face de Tannah, franchit la cha�ne des
Gh�tes-Occidentales, court au nord-est jusqu'� Burhampour, sillonne le
territoire � peu pr�s ind�pendant du Bundelkund, s'�l�ve jusqu'�
Allahabad, s'infl�chit vers l'est, rencontre le Gange � B�nar�s, s'en
�carte l�g�rement, et, redescendant au sud-est par Burdivan et la
ville fran�aise de Chandernagor, il fait t�te de ligne � Calcutta.

C'�tait � quatre heures et demie du soir que les passagers du
_Mongolia_ avaient d�barqu� � Bombay, et le train de Calcutta partait
� huit heures pr�cises.

Mr. Fogg prit donc cong� de ses partenaires, quitta le paquebot,
donna � son domestique le d�tail de quelques emplettes � faire, lui
recommanda express�ment de se trouver avant huit heures � la gare, et,
de son pas r�gulier qui battait la seconde comme le pendule d'une
horloge astronomique, il se dirigea vers le bureau des passeports.

Ainsi donc, des merveilles de Bombay, il ne songeait � rien voir, ni
l'h�tel de ville, ni la magnifique biblioth�que, ni les forts, ni les
docks, ni le march� au coton, ni les bazars, ni les mosqu�es, ni les
synagogues, ni les �glises arm�niennes, ni la splendide pagode de
Malebar-Hill, orn�e de deux tours polygones. Il ne contemplerait ni
les chefs-d'oeuvre d'�l�phanta, ni ses myst�rieux hypog�es, cach�s au
sud-est de la rade, ni les grottes Kanh�rie de l'�le Salcette, ces
admirables restes de l'architecture bouddhiste !

Non ! rien. En sortant du bureau des passeports, Phileas Fogg se
rendit tranquillement � la gare, et l� il se fit servir � d�ner.
Entre autres mets, le ma�tre d'h�tel crut devoir lui recommander une
certaine gibelotte de � lapin du pays �, dont il lui dit merveille.

Phileas Fogg accepta la gibelotte et la go�ta consciencieusement ;
mais, en d�pit de sa sauce �pic�e, il la trouva d�testable.

Il sonna le ma�tre d'h�tel.

� Monsieur, lui dit-il en le regardant fixement, c'est du lapin,
cela ?

-- Oui, mylord, r�pondit
effront�ment le dr�le, du lapin des jungles.

-- Et ce lapin-l� n'a pas miaul� quand on l'a tu� ?

-- Miaul� ! Oh ! mylord ! un lapin ! Je vous jure...

-- Monsieur le ma�tre d'h�tel, reprit froidement Mr. Fogg, ne jurez
pas et rappelez-vous ceci : autrefois, dans l'Inde, les chats �taient
consid�r�s comme des animaux sacr�s. C'�tait le bon temps.

-- Pour les chats, mylord ?

-- Et peut-�tre aussi pour les voyageurs ! �

Cette observation faite, Mr. Fogg continua tranquillement � d�ner.

Quelques instants apr�s Mr. Fogg, l'agent Fix avait, lui aussi,
d�barqu� du _Mongolia_ et couru chez le directeur de la police de
Bombay. Il fit reconna�tre sa qualit� de d�tective, la mission dont
il �tait charg�, sa situation vis-�-vis de l'auteur pr�sum� du vol.
Avait-on re�u de Londres un mandat d'arr�t ?... On n'avait rien re�u.
Et, en effet, le mandat, parti apr�s Fogg, ne pouvait �tre encore
arriv�.

Fix resta fort d�contenanc�. Il voulut obtenir du directeur un ordre
d'arrestation contre le sieur Fogg. Le directeur refusa. L'affaire
regardait l'administration m�tropolitaine, et celle-ci seule pouvait
l�galement d�livrer un mandat. Cette s�v�rit� de principes, cette
observance rigoureuse de la l�galit� est parfaitement explicable avec
les moeurs anglaises, qui, en mati�re de libert� individuelle,
n'admettent aucun arbitraire.

Fix n'insista pas et comprit qu'il devait se r�signer � attendre son
mandat. Mais il r�solut de ne point perdre de vue son imp�n�trable
coquin, pendant tout le temps que celui-ci demeurerait � Bombay. Il
ne doutait pas que Phileas Fogg n'y s�journ�t, et, on le sait, c'�tait
aussi la conviction de Passepartout, -- ce qui laisserait au mandat
d'arr�t le temps d'arriver.

Mais depuis les derniers ordres que lui avait donn�s son ma�tre en
quittant le _Mongolia_, Passepartout avait bien compris qu'il en
serait de Bombay comme de Suez et de Paris, que le voyage ne finirait
pas ici, qu'il se poursuivrait au moins jusqu'� Calcutta, et peut-�tre
plus loin. Et il commen�a � se demander si ce pari de Mr. Fogg
n'�tait pas absolument s�rieux, et si la fatalit� ne l'entra�nait pas,
lui qui voulait vivre en repos, � accomplir le tour du monde en
quatre-vingts jours !

En attendant, et apr�s avoir fait acquisition de quelques chemises et
chaussettes, il se promenait dans les rues de Bombay. Il y avait
grand concours de populaire, et, au milieu d'Europ�ens de toutes
nationalit�s, des Persans � bonnets pointus, des Bunhyas � turbans
ronds, des Sindes � bonnets carr�s, des Arm�niens en longues robes,
des Parsis � mitre noire. C'�tait pr�cis�ment une f�te c�l�br�e par
ces Parsis ou Gu�bres, descendants directs des sectateurs de
Zoroastre, qui sont les plus industrieux, les plus civilis�s, les plus
intelligents, les plus aust�res des Indous, -- race � laquelle
appartiennent actuellement les riches n�gociants indig�nes de Bombay.
Ce jour-l�, ils c�l�braient une sorte de carnaval religieux, avec
processions et divertissements, dans lesquels figuraient des bayad�res
v�tues de gazes roses broch�es d'or et d'argent, qui, au son des
violes et au bruit des tam-tams, dansaient merveilleusement, et avec
une d�cence parfaite, d'ailleurs.

Si Passepartout regardait ces curieuses c�r�monies, si ses yeux et ses
oreilles s'ouvraient d�mesur�ment pour voir et entendre, si son air,
sa physionomie �tait bien celle du � booby � le plus neuf qu'on p�t
imaginer, il est superflu d'y insister ici.

Malheureusement pour lui et pour son ma�tre, dont il risqua de
compromettre le voyage, sa curiosit� l'entra�na plus loin qu'il ne
convenait.

En effet, apr�s avoir entrevu ce carnaval parsi, Passepartout se
dirigeait vers la gare, quand, passant devant l'admirable pagode de
Malebar-Hill, il eut la malencontreuse id�e d'en visiter l'int�rieur.

Il ignorait deux choses : d'abord que l'entr�e de certaines pagodes
indoues est formellement interdite aux chr�tiens, et ensuite que les
croyants eux-m�mes ne peuvent y p�n�trer sans avoir laiss� leurs
chaussures � la porte. Il faut remarquer ici que, par raison de saine
politique, le gouvernement anglais, respectant et faisant respecter
jusque dans ses plus insignifiants d�tails la religion du pays, punit
s�v�rement quiconque en viole les pratiques.

Passepartout, entr� l�, sans penser � mal, comme un simple touriste,
admirait, � l'int�rieur de Malebar-Hill, ce clinquant �blouissant de
l'ornementation brahmanique, quand soudain il fut renvers� sur les
dalles sacr�es. Trois pr�tres, le regard plein de fureur, se
pr�cipit�rent sur lui, arrach�rent ses souliers et ses chaussettes, et
commenc�rent � le rouer de coups, en prof�rant des cris sauvages.

Le Fran�ais, vigoureux et agile, se releva vivement. D'un coup de
poing et d'un coup de pied, il renversa deux de ses adversaires, fort
emp�tr�s dans leurs longues robes, et, s'�lan�ant hors de la pagode de
toute la vitesse de ses jambes, il eut bient�t distanc� le troisi�me
Indou, qui s'�tait jet� sur ses traces, en ameutant la foule.

A huit heures moins cinq, quelques minutes seulement avant le d�part
du train, sans chapeau, pieds nus, ayant perdu dans la bagarre le
paquet contenant ses emplettes, Passepartout arrivait � la gare du
chemin de fer.

Fix �tait l�, sur le quai d'embarquement. Ayant suivi le sieur Fogg �
la gare, il avait compris que ce coquin allait quitter Bombay. Son
parti fut aussit�t pris de l'accompagner jusqu'� Calcutta et plus loin
s'il le fallait. Passepartout ne vit pas Fix, qui se tenait dans
l'ombre, mais Fix entendit le r�cit de ses aventures, que Passepartout
narra en peu de mots � son ma�tre.

� J'esp�re que cela ne vous arrivera plus �, r�pondit simplement
Phileas Fogg, en prenant place dans un des wagons du train.

Le pauvre gar�on, pieds nus et tout d�confit, suivit son ma�tre sans
mot dire.

Fix allait monter dans un wagon s�par�, quand une pens�e le retint et
modifia subitement son projet de d�part.

� Non, je reste, se dit-il. Un d�lit commis sur le territoire
indien... Je tiens mon homme. �

En ce moment, la locomotive lan�a un vigoureux sifflet, et le train
disparut dans la nuit.

                                  XI
                         --------------------
             O� PHILEAS FOGG ACH�TE UNE MONTURE A UN PRIX
                               FABULEUX

Le train �tait parti � l'heure r�glementaire. Il emportait un certain
nombre de voyageurs, quelques officiers, des fonctionnaires civils et
des n�gociants en opium et en indigo, que leur commerce appelait dans
la partie orientale de la p�ninsule.

Passepartout occupait le m�me compartiment que son ma�tre. Un
troisi�me voyageur se trouvait plac� dans le coin oppos�.

C'�tait le brigadier g�n�ral, Sir Francis Cromarty, l'un des
partenaires de Mr. Fogg pendant la travers�e de Suez � Bombay, qui
rejoignait ses troupes cantonn�es aupr�s de B�nar�s.

Sir Francis Cromarty, grand, blond, �g� de cinquante ans environ, qui
s'�tait fort distingu� pendant la derni�re r�volte des cipayes, e�t
v�ritablement m�rit� la qualification d'indig�ne. Depuis son jeune
�ge, il habitait l'Inde et n'avait fait que de rares apparitions dans
son pays natal. C'�tait un homme instruit, qui aurait volontiers
donn� des renseignements sur les coutumes, l'histoire, l'organisation
du pays indou, si Phileas Fogg e�t �t� homme � les demander. Mais ce
gentleman ne demandait rien. Il ne voyageait pas, il d�crivait une
circonf�rence. C'�tait un corps grave, parcourant une orbite autour
du globe terrestre, suivant les lois de la m�canique rationnelle. En
ce moment, il refaisait dans son esprit le calcul des heures d�pens�es
depuis son d�part de Londres, et il se f�t frott� les mains, s'il e�t
�t� dans sa nature de faire un mouvement inutile.

Sir Francis Cromarty n'�tait pas sans avoir reconnu l'originalit� de
son compagnon de route, bien qu'il ne l'e�t �tudi� que les cartes � la
main et entre deux robres. Il �tait donc fond� � se demander si un
coeur humain battait sous cette froide enveloppe, si Phileas Fogg
avait une �me sensible aux beaut�s de la nature, aux aspirations
morales. Pour lui, cela faisait question. De tous les originaux que
le brigadier g�n�ral avait rencontr�s, aucun n'�tait comparable � ce
produit des sciences exactes.

Phileas Fogg n'avait point cach� � Sir Francis Cromarty son projet de
voyage autour du monde, ni dans quelles conditions il l'op�rait. Le
brigadier g�n�ral ne vit dans ce pari qu'une excentricit� sans but
utile et � laquelle manquerait n�cessairement le _transire
benefaciendo_ qui doit guider tout homme raisonnable. Au train dont
marchait le bizarre gentleman, il passerait �videmment sans � rien
faire �, ni pour lui, ni pour les autres.

Une heure apr�s avoir quitt� Bombay, le train, franchissant les
viaducs, avait travers� l'�le Salcette et courait sur le continent. A
la station de Callyan, il laissa sur la droite l'embranchement qui,
par Kandallah et Pounah, descend vers le sud-est de l'Inde, et il
gagna la station de Pauwell. A ce point, il s'engagea dans les
montagnes tr�s ramifi�es des Gh�tes-Occidentales, cha�nes � base de
trapp et de basalte, dont les plus hauts sommets sont couverts de bois
�pais.

De temps � autre, Sir Francis Cromarty et Phileas Fogg �changeaient
quelques paroles, et, � ce moment, le brigadier g�n�ral, relevant une
conversation qui tombait souvent, dit :

� Il y a quelques ann�es, monsieur Fogg, vous auriez �prouv� en cet
endroit un retard qui e�t probablement compromis votre itin�raire.

-- Pourquoi cela, Sir Francis ?

-- Parce que le chemin de fer s'arr�tait � la base de ces montagnes,
qu'il fallait traverser en palanquin ou � dos de poney jusqu'� la
station de Kandallah, situ�e sur le versant oppos�.

-- Ce retard n'e�t aucunement d�rang� l'�conomie de mon programme,
r�pondit Mr. Fogg. Je ne suis pas sans avoir pr�vu l'�ventualit� de
certains obstacles.

-- Cependant, monsieur Fogg, reprit le brigadier g�n�ral, vous
risquiez d'avoir une fort mauvaise affaire sur les bras avec
l'aventure de ce gar�on. �

Passepartout, les pieds entortill�s dans sa couverture de voyage,
dormait profond�ment et ne r�vait gu�re que l'on parl�t de lui.

� Le gouvernement anglais est extr�mement s�v�re et avec raison pour
ce genre de d�lit, reprit Sir Francis Cromarty. Il tient par-dessus
tout � ce que l'on respecte les coutumes religieuses des Indous, et si
votre domestique e�t �t� pris...

-- Eh bien, s'il e�t �t� pris, Sir Francis, r�pondit Mr. Fogg, il
aurait �t� condamn�, il aurait subi sa peine, et puis il serait revenu
tranquillement en Europe. Je ne vois pas en quoi cette affaire e�t pu
retarder son ma�tre ! �

Et, l�-dessus, la conversation retomba. Pendant la nuit, le train
franchit les Gh�tes, passa � Nassik, et le lendemain, 21 octobre, il
s'�lan�ait � travers un pays relativement plat, form� par le
territoire du Khandeish. La campagne, bien cultiv�e, �tait sem�e de
bourgades, au-dessus desquelles le minaret de la pagode rempla�ait le
clocher de l'�glise europ�enne. De nombreux petits cours d'eau, la
plupart affluents ou sous-affluents du Godavery, irriguaient cette
contr�e fertile.

Passepartout, r�veill�, regardait, et ne pouvait croire qu'il
traversait le pays des Indous dans un train du � Great peninsular
railway �. Cela lui paraissait invraisemblable. Et cependant rien de
plus r�el ! La locomotive, dirig�e par le bras d'un m�canicien
anglais et chauff�e de houille anglaise, lan�ait sa fum�e sur les
plantations de caf�iers, de muscadiers, de girofliers, de poivriers
rouges. La vapeur se contournait en spirales autour des groupes de
palmiers, entre lesquels apparaissaient de pittoresques bungalows,
quelques viharis, sortes de monast�res abandonn�s, et des temples
merveilleux qu'enrichissait l'in�puisable ornementation de
l'architecture indienne. Puis, d'immenses �tendues de terrain se
dessinaient � perte de vue, des jungles o� ne manquaient ni les
serpents ni les tigres qu'�pouvantaient les hennissements du train, et
enfin des for�ts, fendues par le trac� de la voie, encore hant�es
d'�l�phants, qui, d'un oeil pensif, regardaient passer le convoi
�chevel�.

Pendant cette matin�e, au-del� de la station de Malligaum, les
voyageurs travers�rent ce territoire funeste, qui fut si souvent
ensanglant� par les sectateurs de la d�esse K�li. Non loin
s'�levaient Ellora et ses pagodes admirables, non loin la c�l�bre
Aurungabad, la capitale du farouche Aureng-Zeb, maintenant simple
chef-lieu de l'une des provinces d�tach�es du royaume du Nizam.
C'�tait sur cette contr�e que Feringhea, le chef des Thugs, le roi des
�trangleurs, exer�ait sa domination. Ces assassins, unis dans une
association insaisissable, �tranglaient, en l'honneur de la d�esse de
la Mort, des victimes de tout �ge, sans jamais verser de sang, et il
fut un temps o� l'on ne pouvait fouiller un endroit quelconque de ce
sol sans y trouver un cadavre. Le gouvernement anglais a bien pu
emp�cher ces meurtres dans une notable proportion, mais l'�pouvantable
association existe toujours et fonctionne encore.

A midi et demi, le train s'arr�ta � la station de Burhampour, et
Passepartout put s'y procurer � prix d'or une paire de babouches,
agr�ment�es de perles fausses, qu'il chaussa avec un sentiment
d'�vidente vanit�.

Les voyageurs d�jeun�rent rapidement, et repartirent pour la station
d'Assurghur, apr�s avoir un instant c�toy� la rive du Tapty, petit
fleuve qui va se jeter dans le golfe de Cambaye, pr�s de Surate.

Il est opportun de faire conna�tre quelles pens�es occupaient alors
l'esprit de Passepartout. Jusqu'� son arriv�e � Bombay, il avait cru
et pu croire que ces choses en resteraient l�. Mais maintenant,
depuis qu'il filait � toute vapeur � travers l'Inde, un revirement
s'�tait fait dans son esprit. Son naturel lui revenait au galop. Il
retrouvait les id�es fantaisistes de sa jeunesse, il prenait au
s�rieux les projets de son ma�tre, il croyait � la r�alit� du pari,
cons�quemment � ce tour du monde et � ce maximum de temps, qu'il ne
fallait pas d�passer. D�j� m�me, il s'inqui�tait des retards
possibles, des accidents qui pouvaient survenir en route. Il se
sentait comme int�ress� dans cette gageure, et tremblait � la pens�e
qu'il avait pu la compromettre la veille par son impardonnable
badauderie. Aussi, beaucoup moins flegmatique que Mr. Fogg, il �tait
beaucoup plus inquiet. Il comptait et recomptait les jours �coul�s,
maudissait les haltes du train, l'accusait de lenteur et bl�mait _in
petto_ Mr. Fogg de n'avoir pas promis une prime au m�canicien. Il ne
savait pas, le brave gar�on, que ce qui �tait possible sur un paquebot
ne l'�tait plus sur un chemin de fer, dont la vitesse est r�glement�e.

Vers le soir, on s'engagea dans les d�fil�s des montagnes de Sutpour,
qui s�parent le territoire du Khandeish de celui du Bundelkund.

Le lendemain, 22 octobre, sur une question de Sir Francis Cromarty,
Passepartout, ayant consult� sa montre, r�pondit qu'il �tait trois
heures du matin. Et, en effet, cette fameuse montre, toujours r�gl�e
sur le m�ridien de Greenwich, qui se trouvait � pr�s de
soixante-dix-sept degr�s dans l'ouest, devait retarder et retardait en
effet de quatre heures.

Sir Francis rectifia donc l'heure donn�e par Passepartout, auquel il
fit la m�me observation que celui-ci avait d�j� re�ue de la part de
Fix. Il essaya de lui faire comprendre qu'il devait se r�gler sur
chaque nouveau m�ridien, et que, puisqu'il marchait constamment vers
l'est, c'est-�-dire au-devant du soleil, les jours �taient plus courts
d'autant de fois quatre minutes qu'il y avait de degr�s parcourus. Ce
fut inutile. Que l'ent�t� gar�on e�t compris ou non l'observation du
brigadier g�n�ral, il s'obstina � ne pas avancer sa montre, qu'il
maintint invariablement � l'heure de Londres. Innocente manie,
d'ailleurs, et qui ne pouvait nuire � personne.

A huit heures du matin et � quinze milles en avant de la station de
Rothal, le train s'arr�ta au milieu d'une vaste clairi�re, bord�e de
quelques bungalows et de cabanes d'ouvriers. Le conducteur du train
passa devant la ligne des wagons en disant :

� Les voyageurs descendent ici. �

Phileas Fogg regarda Sir Francis Cromarty, qui parut ne rien
comprendre � cette halte au milieu d'une for�t de tamarins et de
khajours.

Passepartout, non moins surpris, s'�lan�a sur la voie et revint
presque aussit�t, s'�criant :

� Monsieur, plus de chemin de fer !

-- Que voulez-vous dire ? demanda Sir Francis Cromarty.

-- Je veux dire que le train ne continue pas ! �

Le brigadier g�n�ral descendit aussit�t de wagon. Phileas Fogg le
suivit, sans se presser. Tous deux s'adress�rent au conducteur :

� O� sommes-nous ? demanda Sir Francis Cromarty.

-- Au hameau de Kholby, r�pondit le conducteur.

-- Nous nous arr�tons ici ?

-- Sans doute. Le chemin de fer n'est point achev�...

-- Comment ! il n'est point achev� ?

-- Non ! il y a encore un tron�on d'une cinquantaine de milles �
�tablir entre ce point et Allahabad, o� la voie reprend.

-- Les journaux ont pourtant annonc� l'ouverture compl�te du railway !

-- Que voulez-vous, mon officier, les journaux se sont tromp�s.

-- Et vous donnez des billets de Bombay � Calcutta ! reprit Sir
Francis Cromarty, qui commen�ait � s'�chauffer.

-- Sans doute, r�pondit le conducteur, mais les voyageurs savent bien
qu'ils doivent se faire transporter de Kholby jusqu'� Allahabad. �

Sir Francis Cromarty �tait furieux. Passepartout e�t volontiers
assomm� le conducteur, qui n'en pouvait mais. Il n'osait regarder son
ma�tre.

� Sir Francis, dit simplement Mr. Fogg, nous allons, si vous le
voulez bien, aviser au moyen de gagner Allahabad.

-- Monsieur Fogg, il s'agit ici d'un retard absolument pr�judiciable �
vos int�r�ts ?

-- Non, Sir Francis, cela �tait pr�vu.

-- Quoi ! vous saviez que la voie...

-- En aucune fa�on, mais je savais qu'un obstacle quelconque surgirait
t�t ou tard sur ma route. Or, rien n'est compromis. J'ai deux jours
d'avance � sacrifier. Il y a un steamer qui part de Calcutta pour
Hong-Kong le 25 � midi. Nous ne sommes qu'au 22, et nous arriverons �
temps � Calcutta. �

Il n'y avait rien � dire � une r�ponse faite avec une si compl�te
assurance.

Il n'�tait que trop vrai que les travaux du chemin de fer s'arr�taient
� ce point. Les journaux sont comme certaines montres qui ont la
manie d'avancer, et ils avaient pr�matur�ment annonc� l'ach�vement de
la ligne. La plupart des voyageurs connaissaient cette interruption
de la voie, et, en descendant du train, ils s'�taient empar�s des
v�hicules de toutes sortes que poss�dait la bourgade, palkigharis �
quatre roues, charrettes tra�n�es par des z�bus, sortes de boeufs �
bosses, chars de voyage ressemblant � des pagodes ambulantes,
palanquins, poneys, etc. Aussi Mr. Fogg et Sir Francis Cromarty,
apr�s avoir cherch� dans toute la bourgade, revinrent-ils sans avoir
rien trouv�.

� J'irai � pied �, dit Phileas Fogg.

Passepartout qui rejoignait alors son ma�tre, fit une grimace
significative, en consid�rant ses magnifiques mais insuffisantes
babouches. Fort heureusement il avait �t� de son c�t� � la
d�couverte, et en h�sitant un peu :

� Monsieur, dit-il, je crois que j'ai trouv� un moyen de transport.

-- Lequel ?

-- Un �l�phant ! Un �l�phant qui appartient � un Indien log� � cent
pas d'ici.

-- Allons voir l'�l�phant �, r�pondit Mr. Fogg.

Cinq minutes plus tard, Phileas Fogg, Sir Francis Cromarty et
Passepartout arrivaient pr�s d'une hutte qui attenait � un enclos
ferm� de hautes palissades. Dans la hutte, il y avait un Indien, et
dans l'enclos, un �l�phant. Sur leur demande, l'Indien introduisit
Mr. Fogg et ses deux compagnons dans l'enclos.

L�, ils se trouv�rent en pr�sence d'un animal, � demi domestiqu�, que
son propri�taire �levait, non pour en faire une b�te de somme, mais
une b�te de combat. Dans ce but, il avait commenc� � modifier le
caract�re naturellement doux de l'animal, de fa�on � le conduire
graduellement � ce paroxysme de rage appel� � mutsh � dans la langue
indoue, et cela, en le nourrissant pendant trois mois de sucre et de
beurre. Ce traitement peut para�tre impropre � donner un tel
r�sultat, mais il n'en est pas moins employ� avec succ�s par les
�leveurs. Tr�s heureusement pour Mr. Fogg, l'�l�phant en question
venait � peine d'�tre mis � ce r�gime, et le � mutsh � ne s'�tait
point encore d�clar�.

Kiouni -- c'�tait le nom de la b�te -- pouvait, comme tous ses
cong�n�res, fournir pendant longtemps une marche rapide, et, � d�faut
d'autre monture, Phileas Fogg r�solut de l'employer.

Mais les �l�phants sont chers dans l'Inde, o� ils commencent � devenir
rares. Les m�les, qui seuls conviennent aux luttes des cirques, sont
extr�mement recherch�s. Ces animaux ne se reproduisent que rarement,
quand ils sont r�duits � l'�tat de domesticit�, de telle sorte qu'on
ne peut s'en procurer que par la chasse. Aussi sont-ils l'objet de
soins extr�mes, et lorsque Mr. Fogg demanda � l'Indien s'il voulait
lui louer son �l�phant, l'Indien refusa net.

Fogg insista et offrit de la b�te un prix excessif, dix livres (250 F)
l'heure. Refus. Vingt livres ? Refus encore. Quarante livres ?
Refus toujours. Passepartout bondissait � chaque surench�re. Mais
l'Indien ne se laissait pas tenter.

La somme �tait belle, cependant. En admettant que l'�l�phant employ�t
quinze heures � se rendre � Allahabad, c'�tait six cents livres
(15 000 F) qu'il rapporterait � son propri�taire.

Phileas Fogg, sans s'animer en aucune fa�on, proposa alors � l'Indien
de lui acheter sa b�te et lui en offrit tout d'abord mille livres
(25 000 F).

L'Indien ne voulait pas vendre ! Peut-�tre le dr�le flairait-il une
magnifique affaire.

Sir Francis Cromarty prit Mr. Fogg � part et l'engagea � r�fl�chir
avant d'aller plus loin. Phileas Fogg r�pondit � son compagnon qu'il
n'avait pas l'habitude d'agir sans r�flexion, qu'il s'agissait en fin
de compte d'un pari de vingt mille livres, que cet �l�phant lui �tait
n�cessaire, et que, d�t-il le payer vingt fois sa valeur, il aurait
cet �l�phant.

Mr. Fogg revint trouver l'Indien, dont les petits yeux, allum�s par
la convoitise, laissaient bien voir que pour lui ce n'�tait qu'une
question de prix. Phileas Fogg offrit successivement douze cents
livres, puis quinze cents, puis dix-huit cents, enfin deux mille (50
000 F). Passepartout, si rouge d'ordinaire, �tait p�le d'�motion.

A deux mille livres, l'Indien se rendit.

� Par mes babouches, s'�cria Passepartout, voil� qui met � un beau
prix la viande d'�l�phant ! �

L'affaire conclue, il ne s'agissait plus que de trouver un guide. Ce
fut plus facile. Un jeune Parsi, � la figure intelligente, offrit ses
services. Mr. Fogg accepta et lui promit une forte r�mun�ration, qui
ne pouvait que doubler son intelligence.

L'�l�phant fut amen� et �quip� sans retard. Le Parsi connaissait
parfaitement le m�tier de � mahout � ou cornac. Il couvrit d'une
sorte de housse le dos de l'�l�phant et disposa, de chaque c�t� sur
ses flancs, deux esp�ces de cacolets assez peu confortables.

Phileas Fogg paya l'Indien en bank-notes qui furent extraites du
fameux sac. Il semblait vraiment qu'on les tir�t des entrailles de
Passepartout. Puis Mr. Fogg offrit � Sir Francis Cromarty de le
transporter � la station d'Allahabad. Le brigadier g�n�ral accepta.
Un voyageur de plus n'�tait pas pour fatiguer le gigantesque animal.

Des vivres furent achet�es � Kholby. Sir Francis Cromarty prit place
dans l'un des cacolets, Phileas Fogg dans l'autre. Passepartout se
mit � califourchon sur la housse entre son ma�tre et le brigadier
g�n�ral. Le Parsi se jucha sur le cou de l'�l�phant, et � neuf heures
l'animal, quittant la bourgade, s'enfon�ait par le plus court dans
l'�paisse for�t de lataniers.

                                 XII
                         --------------------
            O� PHILEAS FOGG ET SES COMPAGNONS S'AVENTURENT
           A TRAVERS LES FOR�TS DE L'INDE ET CE QUI S'ENSUIT

Le guide, afin d'abr�ger la distance � parcourir, laissa sur sa droite
le trac� de la voie dont les travaux �taient en cours d'ex�cution. Ce
trac�, tr�s contrari� par les capricieuses ramifications des monts
Vindhias, ne suivait pas le plus court chemin, que Phileas Fogg avait
int�r�t � prendre. Le Parsi, tr�s familiaris� avec les routes et
sentiers du pays, pr�tendait gagner une vingtaine de milles en coupant
� travers la for�t, et on s'en rapporta � lui.

Phileas Fogg et Sir Francis Cromarty, enfouis jusqu'au cou dans leurs
cacolets, �taient fort secou�s par le trot raide de l'�l�phant, auquel
son mahout imprimait une allure rapide. Mais ils enduraient la
situation avec le flegme le plus britannique, causant peu d'ailleurs,
et se voyant � peine l'un l'autre.

Quant � Passepartout, post� sur le dos de la b�te et directement
soumis aux coups et aux contrecoups, il se gardait bien, sur une
recommandation de son ma�tre, de tenir sa langue entre ses dents, car
elle e�t �t� coup�e net. Le brave gar�on, tant�t lanc� sur le cou de
l'�l�phant, tant�t rejet� sur la croupe, faisait de la voltige, comme
un clown sur un tremplin. Mais il plaisantait, il riait au milieu de
ses sauts de carpe, et, de temps en temps, il tirait de son sac un
morceau de sucre, que l'intelligent Kiouni prenait du bout de sa
trompe, sans interrompre un instant son trot r�gulier.

Apr�s deux heures de marche, le guide arr�ta l'�l�phant et lui donna
une heure de repos. L'animal d�vora des branchages et des
arbrisseaux, apr�s s'�tre d'abord d�salt�r� � une mare voisine. Sir
Francis Cromarty ne se plaignit pas de cette halte. Il �tait bris�.
Mr. Fogg paraissait �tre aussi dispos que s'il f�t sorti de son lit.

� Mais il est donc de fer ! dit le brigadier g�n�ral en le regardant
avec admiration.

-- De fer forg� �, r�pondit Passepartout, qui s'occupa de pr�parer un
d�jeuner sommaire.

A midi, le guide donna le signal du d�part. Le pays prit bient�t un
aspect tr�s sauvage. Aux grandes for�ts succ�d�rent des taillis de
tamarins et de palmiers nains, puis de vastes plaines arides,
h�riss�es de maigres arbrisseaux et sem�es de gros blocs de sy�nites.
Toute cette partie du haut Bundelkund, peu fr�quent�e des voyageurs,
est habit�e par une population fanatique, endurcie dans les pratiques
les plus terribles de la religion indoue. La domination des Anglais
n'a pu s'�tablir r�guli�rement sur un territoire soumis � l'influence
des rajahs, qu'il e�t �t� difficile d'atteindre dans leurs
inaccessibles retraites des Vindhias.

Plusieurs fois, on aper�ut des bandes d'Indiens farouches, qui
faisaient un geste de col�re en voyant passer le rapide quadrup�de.
D'ailleurs, le Parsi les �vitait autant que possible, les tenant pour
des gens de mauvaise rencontre. On vit peu d'animaux pendant cette
journ�e, � peine quelques singes, qui fuyaient avec mille contorsions
et grimaces dont s'amusait fort Passepartout.

Une pens�e au milieu de bien d'autres inqui�tait ce gar�on. Qu'est-ce
que Mr. Fogg ferait de l'�l�phant, quand il serait arriv� � la
station d'Allahabad ? L'emm�nerait-il ? Impossible ! Le prix du
transport ajout� au prix d'acquisition en ferait un animal ruineux.
Le vendrait-on, le rendrait-on � la libert� ? Cette estimable b�te
m�ritait bien qu'on e�t des �gards pour elle. Si, par hasard, Mr.
Fogg lui en faisait cadeau, � lui, Passepartout, il en serait tr�s
embarrass�. Cela ne laissait pas de le pr�occuper.

A huit heures du soir, la principale cha�ne des Vindhias avait �t�
franchie, et les voyageurs firent halte au pied du versant
septentrional, dans un bungalow en ruine.

La distance parcourue pendant cette journ�e �tait d'environ vingt-cinq
milles, et il en restait autant � faire pour atteindre la station
d'Allahabad.

La nuit �tait froide. A l'int�rieur du bungalow, le Parsi alluma un
feu de branches s�ches, dont la chaleur fut tr�s appr�ci�e. Le souper
se composa des provisions achet�es � Kholby. Les voyageurs mang�rent
en gens harass�s et moulus. La conversation, qui commen�a par
quelques phrases entrecoup�es, se termina bient�t par des ronflements
sonores. Le guide veilla pr�s de Kiouni, qui s'endormit debout,
appuy� au tronc d'un gros arbre.

Nul incident ne signala cette nuit. Quelques rugissements de gu�pards
et de panth�res troubl�rent parfois le silence, m�l�s � des ricanement
aigus de singes. Mais les carnassiers s'en tinrent � des cris et ne
firent aucune d�monstration hostile contre les h�tes du bungalow. Sir
Francis Cromarty dormit lourdement comme un brave militaire rompu de
fatigues. Passepartout, dans un sommeil agit�, recommen�a en r�ve la
culbute de la veille. quant � Mr. Fogg, il reposa aussi paisiblement
que s'il e�t �t� dans sa tranquille maison de Saville-row.

A six heures du matin, on se remit en marche. Le guide esp�rait
arriver � la station d'Allahabad le soir m�me. De cette fa�on, Mr.
Fogg ne perdrait qu'une partie des quarante-huit heures �conomis�es
depuis le commencement du voyage.

On descendit les derni�res rampes des Vindhias. Kiouni avait repris
son allure rapide. Vers midi, le guide tourna la bourgade de
Kallenger, situ�e sur le Cani, un des sous-affluents du Gange. Il
�vitait toujours les lieux habit�s, se sentant plus en s�ret� dans ces
campagnes d�sertes, qui marquent les premi�res d�pressions du bassin
du grand fleuve. La station d'Allahabad n'�tait pas � douze milles
dans le nord-est. On fit halte sous un bouquet de bananiers, dont les
fruits, aussi sains que le pain, � aussi succulents que la cr�me �,
disent les voyageurs, furent extr�mement appr�ci�s.

A deux heures, le guide entra sous le couvert d'une �paisse for�t,
qu'il devait traverser sur un espace de plusieurs milles. Il
pr�f�rait voyager ainsi � l'abri des bois. En tout cas, il n'avait
fait jusqu'alors aucune rencontre f�cheuse, et le voyage semblait
devoir s'accomplir sans accident, quand l'�l�phant, donnant quelques
signes d'inqui�tude, s'arr�ta soudain.

Il �tait quatre heures alors.

� Qu'y a-t-il ? demanda Sir Francis Cromarty, qui releva la t�te
au-dessus de son cacolet.

-- Je ne sais, mon officier �, r�pondit le Parsi, en pr�tant l'oreille
� un murmure confus qui passais sous l'�paisse ramure.

Quelques instants apr�s, ce murmure devint plus d�finissable. On e�t
dit un concert, encore fort �loign�, de voix humaines et d'instruments
de cuivre.

Passepartout �tait tout yeux, tout oreilles. Mr. Fogg attendait
patiemment, sans prononcer une parole.

Le Parsi sauta � terre, attacha l'�l�phant � un arbre et s'enfon�a au
plus �pais du taillis. Quelques minutes plus tard, il revint,
disant :

� Une procession de brahmanes qui se dirige de ce c�t�. S'il est
possible, �vitons d'�tre vus. �

Le guide d�tacha l'�l�phant et le conduisit dans un fourr�, en
recommandant aux voyageurs de ne point mettre pied � terre. Lui-m�me
se tint pr�t � enfourcher rapidement sa monture, si la fuite devenait
n�cessaire. Mais il pensa que la troupe des fid�les passerait sans
l'apercevoir, car l'�paisseur du feuillage le dissimulait enti�rement.

Le bruit discordant des voix et des instruments se rapprochait. Des
chants monotones se m�laient au son des tambours et des cymbales.
Bient�t la t�te de la procession apparut sous les arbres, � une
cinquantaine de pas du poste occup� par Mr. Fogg et ses compagnons.
Ils distinguaient ais�ment � travers les branches le curieux personnel
de cette c�r�monie religieuse.

En premi�re ligne s'avan�aient des pr�tres, coiff�s de mitres et v�tus
de longues robes chamarr�es. Ils �taient entour�s d'hommes, de
femmes, d'enfants, qui faisaient entendre une sorte de psalmodie
fun�bre, interrompue � intervalles �gaux par des coups de tam-tams et
de cymbales. Derri�re eux, sur un char aux larges roues dont les
rayons et la jante figuraient un entrelacement de serpents, apparut
une statue hideuse, tra�n�e par deux couples de z�bus richement
capara�onn�s. Cette statue avait quatre bras ; le corps colori� d'un
rouge sombre, les yeux hagards, les cheveux emm�l�s, la langue
pendante, les l�vres teintes de henn� et de b�tel. A son cou
s'enroulait un collier de t�tes de mort, � ses flancs une ceinture de
mains coup�es. Elle se tenait debout sur un g�ant terrass� auquel le
chef manquait.

Sir Francis Cromarty reconnut cette statue.

� La d�esse K�li, murmura-t-il, la d�esse de l'amour et de la mort.

-- De la mort, j'y consens, mais de l'amour, jamais ! dit
Passepartout. La vilaine bonne femme ! �

Le Parsi lui fit signe de se taire.

Autour de la statue s'agitait, se d�menait, se convulsionnait un
groupe de vieux fakirs, z�br�s de bandes d'ocre, couverts d'incisions
cruciales qui laissaient �chapper leur sang goutte � goutte,
�nergum�nes stupides qui, dans les grandes c�r�monies indoues, se
pr�cipitent encore sous les roues du char de Jaggernaut.

Derri�re eux, quelques brahmanes, dans toute la somptuosit� de leur
costume oriental, tra�naient une femme qui se soutenait � peine.

Cette femme �tait jeune, blanche comme une Europ�enne. Sa t�te, son
cou, ses �paules, ses oreilles, ses bras, ses mains, ses orteils
�taient surcharg�s de bijoux, colliers, bracelets, boucles et bagues.
Une tunique lam�e d'or, recouverte d'une mousseline l�g�re, dessinait
les contours de sa taille.

Derri�re cette jeune femme -- contraste violent pour les yeux --, des
gardes arm�s de sabres nus pass�s � leur ceinture et de longs
pistolets damasquin�s, portaient un cadavre sur un palanquin.

C'�tait le corps d'un vieillard, rev�tu de ses opulents habits de
rajah, ayant, comme en sa vie, le turban brod� de perles, la robe
tissue de soie et d'or, la ceinture de cachemire diamant�, et ses
magnifiques armes de prince indien.

Puis des musiciens et une arri�re-garde de fanatiques, dont les cris
couvraient parfois l'assourdissant fracas des instruments, fermaient
le cort�ge.

Sir Francis Cromarty regardait toute cette pompe d'un air
singuli�rement attrist�, et se tournant vers le guide :

� Un sutty ! � dit-il.

Le Parsi fit un signe affirmatif et mit un doigt sur ses l�vres. La
longue procession se d�roula lentement sous les arbres, et bient�t ses
derniers rangs disparurent dans la profondeur de la for�t.

Peu � peu, les chants s'�teignirent. Il y eut encore quelques �clats
de cris lointains, et enfin � tout ce tumulte succ�da un profond
silence.

Phileas Fogg avait entendu ce mot, prononc� par Sir Francis Cromarty,
et aussit�t que la procession eut disparu :

� Qu'est-ce qu'un sutty ? demanda-t-il.

-- Un sutty, monsieur Fogg, r�pondit le brigadier g�n�ral, c'est un
sacrifice humain, mais un sacrifice volontaire. Cette femme que vous
venez de voir sera br�l�e demain aux premi�res heures du jour.

-- Ah ! les gueux ! s'�cria Passepartout, qui ne put retenir ce cri
d'indignation.

-- Et ce cadavre ? demanda Mr. Fogg.

-- C'est celui du prince, son mari, r�pondit le guide, un rajah
ind�pendant du Bundelkund.

-- Comment ! reprit Phileas Fogg, sans que sa voix trah�t la moindre
�motion, ces barbares coutumes subsistent encore dans l'Inde, et les
Anglais n'ont pu les d�truire ?

-- Dans la plus grande partie de l'Inde, r�pondit Sir Francis
Cromarty, ces sacrifices ne s'accomplissent plus, mais nous n'avons
aucune influence sur ces contr�es sauvages, et principalement sur ce
territoire du Bundelkund. Tout le revers septentrional des Vindhias
est le th��tre de meurtres et de pillages incessants.

-- La malheureuse ! murmurait Passepartout, br�l�e vive !

-- Oui, reprit le brigadier g�n�ral, br�l�e, et si elle ne l'�tait
pas, vous ne sauriez croire � quelle mis�rable condition elle se
verrait r�duite par ses proches. On lui raserait les cheveux, on la
nourrirait � peine de quelques poign�es de riz, on la repousserait,
elle serait consid�r�e comme une cr�ature immonde et mourrait dans
quelque coin comme un chien galeux. Aussi la perspective de cette
affreuse existence pousse-t-elle souvent ces malheureuses au supplice,
bien plus que l'amour ou le fanatisme religieux. Quelquefois,
cependant, le sacrifice est r�ellement volontaire, et il faut
l'intervention �nergique du gouvernement pour l'emp�cher. Ainsi, il y
a quelques ann�es, je r�sidais � Bombay, quand une jeune veuve vint
demander au gouverneur l'autorisation de se br�ler avec le corps de
son mari. Comme vous le pensez bien, le gouverneur refusa. Alors la
veuve quitta la ville, se r�fugia chez un rajah ind�pendant, et l�
elle consomma son sacrifice. �

Pendant le r�cit du brigadier g�n�ral, le guide secouait la t�te, et,
quand le r�cit fut achev� :

� Le sacrifice qui aura lieu demain au lever du jour n'est pas
volontaire, dit-il.

-- Comment le savez-vous ?

-- C'est une histoire que tout le monde conna�t dans le Bundelkund,
r�pondit le guide.

-- Cependant cette infortun�e ne paraissait faire aucune r�sistance,
fit observer Sir Francis Cromarty.

-- Cela tient � ce qu'on l'a enivr�e de la fum�e du chanvre et de
l'opium.

-- Mais o� la conduit-on ?

-- A la pagode de Pillaji, � deux milles d'ici. L�, elle passera la
nuit en attendant l'heure du sacrifice.

-- Et ce sacrifice aura lieu ?...

-- Demain, d�s la premi�re apparition du jour. �

Apr�s cette r�ponse, le guide fit sortir l'�l�phant de l'�pais fourr�
et se hissa sur le cou de l'animal. Mais au moment o� il allait
l'exciter par un sifflement particulier, Mr. Fogg l'arr�ta, et,
s'adressant � Sir Francis Cromarty :

� Si nous sauvions cette femme ? dit-il.

-- Sauver cette femme, monsieur Fogg !... s'�cria le brigadier
g�n�ral.

-- J'ai encore douze heures d'avance. Je puis les consacrer � cela.

-- Tiens ! Mais vous �tes un homme de coeur ! dit Sir Francis
Cromarty.

-- Quelquefois, r�pondit simplement Phileas Fogg. quand j'ai le
temps. �

                                 XIII
                         --------------------
          DANS LEQUEL PASSEPARTOUT PROUVE UNE FOIS DE PLUS
                 QUE LA FORTUNE SOURIT AUX AUDACIEUX

Le dessein �tait hardi, h�riss� de difficult�s, impraticable peut-�tre
Mr. Fogg allait risquer sa vie, ou tout au moins sa libert�, et par
cons�quent la r�ussite de ses projets, mais il n'h�sita pas. Il
trouva, d'ailleurs, dans Sir Francis Cromarty, un auxiliaire d�cid�.

Quant � Passepartout, il �tait pr�t, on pouvait disposer de lui.
L'id�e de son ma�tre l'exaltait. Il sentait un coeur, une �me sous
cette enveloppe de glace. Il se prenait � aimer Phileas Fogg.

Restait le guide. Quel parti prendrait-il dans l'affaire ? Ne
serait-il pas port� pour les hindous ? A d�faut de son concours, il
fallait au moins s'assurer sa neutralit�.

Sir Francis Cromarty lui posa franchement la question.

� Mon officier, r�pondit le guide, je suis Parsi, et cette femme est
Parsie. Disposez de moi.

-- Bien, guide, r�pondit Mr. Fogg.

-- Toutefois, sachez-le bien, reprit le Parsi, non seulement nous
risquons notre vie, mais des supplices horribles, si nous sommes pris.
Ainsi, voyez.

-- C'est vu, r�pondit Mr. Fogg. Je pense que nous devrons attendre
la nuit pour agir ?

-- Je le pense aussi �, r�pondit le guide.

Ce brave Indou donna alors quelques d�tails sur la victime. C'�tait
une Indienne d'une beaut� c�l�bre, de race parsie, fille de riches
n�gociants de Bombay. Elle avait re�u dans cette ville une �ducation
absolument anglaise, et � ses mani�res, � son instruction, on l'e�t
crue Europ�enne. Elle se nommait Aouda.

Orpheline, elle fut mari�e malgr� elle � ce vieux rajah du Bundelkund.
Trois mois apr�s, elle devint veuve. Sachant le sort qui l'attendait,
elle s'�chappa, fut reprise aussit�t, et les parents du rajah, qui
avaient int�r�t � sa mort, la vou�rent � ce supplice auquel il ne
semblait pas qu'elle p�t �chapper.

Ce r�cit ne pouvait qu'enraciner Mr. Fogg et ses compagnons dans leur
g�n�reuse r�solution. Il fut d�cid� que le guide dirigerait
l'�l�phant vers la pagode de Pillaji, dont il se rapprocherait autant
que possible.

Une demi-heure apr�s, halte fut faite sous un taillis, � cinq cents
pas de la pagode, que l'on ne pouvait apercevoir ; mais les hurlements
des fanatiques se laissaient entendre distinctement.

Les moyens de parvenir jusqu'� la victime furent alors discut�s. Le
guide connaissait cette pagode de Pillaji, dans laquelle il affirmait
que la jeune femme �tait emprisonn�e. Pourrait-on y p�n�trer par une
des portes, quand toute la bande serait plong�e dans le sommeil de
l'ivresse, ou faudrait-il pratiquer un trou dans une muraille ? C'est
ce qui ne pourrait �tre d�cid� qu'au moment et au lieu m�mes. Mais ce
qui ne fit aucun doute, c'est que l'enl�vement devait s'op�rer cette
nuit m�me, et non quand, le jour venu, la victime serait conduite au
supplice. A cet instant, aucune intervention humaine n'e�t pu la
sauver.

Mr. Fogg et ses compagnons attendirent la nuit. D�s que l'ombre se
fit, vers six heures du soir, ils r�solurent d'op�rer une
reconnaissance autour de la pagode. Les derniers cris des fakirs
s'�teignaient alors. Suivant leur habitude, ces Indiens devaient �tre
plong�s dans l'�paisse ivresse du � hang � -- opium liquide, m�lang�
d'une infusion de chanvre --, et il serait peut-�tre possible de se
glisser entre eux jusqu'au temple.

Le Parsi, guidant Mr. Fogg, Sir Francis Cromarty et Passepartout,
s'avan�a sans bruit � travers la for�t. Apr�s dix minutes de
reptation sous les ramures, ils arriv�rent au bord d'une petite
rivi�re, et l�, � la lueur de torches de fer � la pointe desquelles
br�laient des r�sines, ils aper�urent un monceau de bois empil�.
C'�tait le b�cher, fait de pr�cieux santal, et d�j� impr�gn� d'une
huile parfum�e. A sa partie sup�rieure reposait le corps embaum� du
rajah, qui devait �tre br�l� en m�me temps que sa veuve. A cent pas
de ce b�cher s'�levait la pagode, dont les minarets per�aient dans
l'ombre la cime des arbres.

� Venez ! � dit le guide � voix basse.

Et, redoublant de pr�caution, suivi de ses compagnons, il se glissa
silencieusement � travers les grandes herbes.

Le silence n'�tait plus interrompu que par le murmure du vent dans les
branches.

Bient�t le guide s'arr�ta � l'extr�mit� d'une clairi�re. Quelques
r�sines �clairaient la place. Le sol �tait jonch� de groupes de
dormeurs, appesantis par l'ivresse. On e�t dit un champ de bataille
couvert de morts. Hommes, femmes, enfants, tout �tait confondu.
Quelques ivrognes r�laient encore �� et l�.

A l'arri�re-plan, entre la masse des arbres, le temple de Pillaji se
dressait confus�ment. Mais au grand d�sappointement du guide, les
gardes des rajahs, �clair�s par des torches fuligineuses, veillaient
aux portes et se promenaient, le sabre nu. On pouvait supposer qu'�
l'int�rieur les pr�tres veillaient aussi.

Le Parsi ne s'avan�a pas plus loin. Il avait reconnu l'impossibilit�
de forcer l'entr�e du temple, et il ramena ses compagnons en arri�re.

Phileas Fogg et Sir Francis Cromarty avaient compris comme lui qu'ils
ne pouvaient rien tenter de ce c�t�.

Ils s'arr�t�rent et s'entretinrent � voix basse.

� Attendons, dit le brigadier g�n�ral, il n'est que huit heures
encore, et il est possible que ces gardes succombent aussi au sommeil.

-- Cela est possible, en effet �, r�pondit le Parsi.

Phileas Fogg et ses compagnons s'�tendirent donc au pied d'un arbre et
attendirent.

Le temps leur parut long ! Le guide les quittait parfois et allait
observer la lisi�re du bois. Les gardes du rajah veillaient toujours
� la lueur des torches, et une vague lumi�re filtrait � travers les
fen�tres de la pagode.

On attendit ainsi jusqu'� minuit. La situation ne changea pas. M�me
surveillance au-dehors. Il �tait �vident qu'on ne pouvait compter sur
l'assoupissement des gardes. L'ivresse du � hang � leur avait �t�
probablement �pargn�e. Il fallait donc agir autrement et p�n�trer par
une ouverture pratiqu�e aux murailles de la pagode. Restait la
question de savoir si les pr�tres veillaient aupr�s de leur victime
avec autant de soin que les soldats � la porte du temple.

Apr�s une derni�re conversation, le guide se dit pr�t � partir. Mr.
Fogg, Sir Francis et Passepartout le suivirent. Ils firent un d�tour
assez long, afin d'atteindre la pagode par son chevet.

Vers minuit et demi, ils arriv�rent au pied des murs sans avoir
rencontr� personne. Aucune surveillance n'avait �t� �tablie de ce
c�t�, mais il est vrai de dire que fen�tres et portes manquaient
absolument.

L� nuit �tait sombre. La lune, alors dans son dernier quartier,
quittait � peine l'horizon, encombr� de gros nuages. La hauteur des
arbres accroissait encore l'obscurit�.

Mais il ne suffisait pas d'avoir atteint le pied des murailles, il
fallait encore y pratiquer une ouverture. Pour cette op�ration,
Phileas Fogg et ses compagnons n'avaient absolument que leurs couteaux
de poche. Tr�s heureusement, les parois du temple se composaient d'un
m�lange de briques et de bois qui ne pouvait �tre difficile � percer.
La premi�re brique une fois enlev�e, les autres viendraient
facilement.

On se mit � la besogne, en faisant le moins de bruit possible. Le
Parsi d'un c�t�, Passepartout, de l'autre, travaillaient � desceller
les briques, de mani�re � obtenir une ouverture large de deux pieds.

Le travail avan�ait, quand un cri se fit entendre � l'int�rieur du
temple, et presque aussit�t d'autres cris lui r�pondirent du dehors.

Passepartout et le guide interrompirent leur travail. Les avait-on
surpris ? L'�veil �tait-il donn� ? La plus vulgaire prudence leur
commandait de s'�loigner, -- ce qu'ils firent en m�me temps que
Phileas Fogg et sir Francis Cromarty. Ils se blottirent de nouveau
sous le couvert du bois, attendant que l'alerte, si c'en �tait une, se
f�t dissip�e, et pr�ts, dans ce cas, � reprendre leur op�ration.

Mais -- contretemps funeste -- des gardes se montr�rent au chevet de
la pagode, et s'y install�rent de mani�re � emp�cher toute approche.

Il serait difficile de d�crire le d�sappointement de ces quatre
hommes, arr�t�s dans leur oeuvre. Maintenant qu'ils ne pouvaient plus
parvenir jusqu'� la victime, comment la sauveraient-ils ? Sir Francis
Cromarty se rongeait les poings. Passepartout �tait hors de lui, et
le guide avait quelque peine � le contenir. L'impassible Fogg
attendait sans manifester ses sentiments.

� N'avons-nous plus qu'� partir ? demanda le brigadier g�n�ral � voix
basse.

-- Nous n'avons plus qu'� partir, r�pondit le guide.

-- Attendez, dit Fogg. Il suffit que je sois demain � Allahabad avant
midi.

-- Mais qu'esp�rez-vous ? r�pondit Sir Francis Cromarty. Dans
quelques heures le jour va para�tre, et...

-- La chance qui nous �chappe peut se repr�senter au moment supr�me. �

Le brigadier g�n�ral aurait voulu pouvoir lire dans les yeux de
Phileas Fogg.

Sur quoi comptait donc ce froid Anglais ? Voulait-il, au moment du
supplice, se pr�cipiter vers la jeune femme et l'arracher ouvertement
� ses bourreaux ?

C'e�t �t� une folie, et comment admettre que cet homme f�t fou � ce
point ? N�anmoins, Sir Francis Cromarty consentit � attendre jusqu'au
d�nouement de cette terrible sc�ne. Toutefois, le guide ne laissa pas
ses compagnons � l'endroit o� ils s'�taient r�fugi�s, et il les ramena
vers la partie ant�rieure de la clairi�re. L�, abrit�s par un bouquet
d'arbres, ils pouvaient observer les groupes endormis.

Cependant Passepartout, juch� sur les premi�res branches d'un arbre,
ruminait une id�e qui avait d'abord travers� son esprit comme un
�clair, et qui finit par s'incruster dans son cerveau.

Il avait commenc� par se dire : � Quelle folie ! � et maintenant il
r�p�tait : � Pourquoi pas, apr�s tout ? C'est une chance, peut-�tre
la seule, et avec de tels abrutis !... �

En tout cas, Passepartout ne formula pas autrement sa pens�e, mais il
ne tarda pas � se glisser avec la souplesse d'un serpent sur les
basses branches de l'arbre dont l'extr�mit� se courbait vers le sol.

Les heures s'�coulaient, et bient�t quelques nuances moins sombres
annonc�rent l'approche du jour. Cependant l'obscurit� �tait profonde
encore.

C'�tait le moment. Il se fit comme une r�surrection dans cette foule
assoupie. Les groupes s'anim�rent. Des coups de tam-tam retentirent.
Chants et cris �clat�rent de nouveau. L'heure �tait venue � laquelle
l'infortun�e allait mourir.

En effet, les portes de la pagode s'ouvrirent. Une lumi�re plus vive
s'�chappa de l'int�rieur. Mr. Fogg et Sir Francis Cromarty purent
apercevoir la victime, vivement �clair�e, que deux pr�tres tra�naient
au-dehors. Il leur sembla m�me que, secouant l'engourdissement de
l'ivresse par un supr�me instinct de conservation, la malheureuse
tentait d'�chapper � ses bourreaux. Le coeur de Sir Francis Cromarty
bondit, et par un mouvement convulsif, saisissant la main de Phileas
Fogg, il sentit que cette main tenait un couteau ouvert.

En ce moment, la foule s'�branla. La jeune femme �tait retomb�e dans
cette torpeur provoqu�e par les fum�es du chanvre. Elle passa �
travers les fakirs, qui l'escortaient de leurs vocif�rations
religieuses.

Phileas Fogg et ses compagnons, se m�lant aux derniers rangs de la
foule, la suivirent.

Deux minutes apr�s, ils arrivaient sur le bord de la rivi�re et
s'arr�taient � moins de cinquante pas du b�cher, sur lequel �tait
couch� le corps du rajah. Dans la demi-obscurit�, ils virent la
victime absolument inerte, �tendue aupr�s du cadavre de son �poux.

Puis une torche fut approch�e et le bois impr�gn� d'huile, s'enflamma
aussit�t.

A ce moment, Sir Francis Cromarty et le guide retinrent Phileas Fogg,
qui dans un moment de folie g�n�reuse, s'�lan�ait vers le b�cher...

Mais Phileas Fogg les avait d�j� repouss�s, quand la sc�ne changea
soudain. Un cri de terreur s'�leva. Toute cette foule se pr�cipita �
terre, �pouvant�e.

Le vieux rajah n'�tait donc pas mort, qu'on le v�t se redresser tout �
coup, comme un fant�me, soulever la jeune femme dans ses bras,
descendre du b�cher au milieu des tourbillons de vapeurs qui lui
donnaient une apparence spectrale ?

Les fakirs, les gardes, les pr�tres, pris d'une terreur subite,
�taient l�, face � terre, n'osant lever les yeux et regarder un tel
prodige !

La victime inanim�e passa entre les bras vigoureux qui la portaient,
et sans qu'elle par�t leur peser. Mr. Fogg et Sir Francis Cromarty
�taient demeur�s debout. Le Parsi avait courb� la t�te, et
Passepartout, sans doute, n'�tait pas moins stup�fi� !...

Ce ressuscit� arriva ainsi pr�s de l'endroit o� se tenaient Mr. Fogg
et Sir Francis Cromarty, et l�, d'une voix br�ve :

� Filons !... � dit-il.

C'�tait Passepartout lui-m�me qui s'�tait gliss� vers le b�cher au
milieu de la fum�e �paisse ! C'�tait Passepartout qui, profitant de
l'obscurit� profonde encore, avait arrach� la jeune femme � la mort !
C'�tait Passepartout qui, jouant son r�le avec un audacieux bonheur,
passait au milieu de l'�pouvante g�n�rale !

Un instant apr�s, tous quatre disparaissaient dans le bois, et
l'�l�phant les emportait d'un trot rapide. Mais des cris, des
clameurs et m�me une balle, per�ant le chapeau de Phileas Fogg, leur
apprirent que la ruse �tait d�couverte.

En effet, sur le b�cher enflamm� se d�tachait alors le corps du vieux
rajah. Les pr�tres, revenus de leur frayeur, avaient compris qu'un
enl�vement venait de s'accomplir.

Aussit�t ils s'�taient pr�cipit�s dans la for�t. Les gardes les
avaient suivis. Une d�charge avait eu lieu, mais les ravisseurs
fuyaient rapidement, et, en quelques instants, ils se trouvaient hors
de la port�e des balles et des fl�ches.

                                 XIV
                         --------------------
          DANS LEQUEL PHILEAS FOGG DESCEND TOUTE L'ADMIRABLE
              VALL�E DU GANGE SANS M�ME SONGER A LA VOIR

Le hardi enl�vement avait r�ussi. Une heure apr�s, Passepartout riait
encore de son succ�s. Sir Francis Cromarty avait serr� la main de
l'intr�pide gar�on. Son ma�tre lui avait dit : � Bien �, ce qui, dans
la bouche de ce gentleman, �quivalait � une haute approbation. A quoi
Passepartout avait r�pondu que tout l'honneur de l'affaire appartenait
� son ma�tre. Pour lui, il n'avait eu qu'une id�e � dr�le �, et il
riait en songeant que, pendant quelques instants, lui, Passepartout,
ancien gymnaste, ex-sergent de pompiers, avait �t� le veuf d'une
charmante femme, un vieux rajah embaum� !

Quant � la jeune Indienne, elle n'avait pas eu conscience de ce qui
s'�tait pass�. Envelopp�e dans les couvertures de voyage, elle
reposait sur l'un des cacolets.

Cependant l'�l�phant, guid� avec une extr�me s�ret� par le Parsi,
courait rapidement dans la for�t encore obscure. Une heure apr�s
avoir quitt� la pagode de Pillaji, il se lan�ait � travers une immense
plaine. A sept heures, on fit halte. La jeune femme �tait toujours
dans une prostration compl�te. Le guide lui fit boire quelques
gorg�es d'eau et de brandy, mais cette influence stup�fiante qui
l'accablait devait se prolonger quelque temps encore.

Sir Francis Cromarty, qui connaissait les effets de l'ivresse produite
par l'inhalation des vapeurs du chanvre, n'avait aucune inqui�tude sur
son compte.

Mais si le r�tablissement de la jeune Indienne ne fit pas question
dans l'esprit du brigadier g�n�ral, celui-ci se montrait moins rassur�
pour l'avenir. Il n'h�sita pas � dire � Phileas Fogg que si Mrs.
Aouda restait dans l'Inde, elle retomberait in�vitablement entre les
mains de ses bourreaux. Ces �nergum�nes se tenaient dans toute la
p�ninsule, et certainement, malgr� la police anglaise, ils sauraient
reprendre leur victime, f�t-ce � Madras, � Bombay, � Calcutta. Et Sir
Francis Cromarty citait, � l'appui de ce dire, un fait de m�me nature
qui s'�tait pass� r�cemment. A son avis, la jeune femme ne serait
v�ritablement en s�ret� qu'apr�s avoir quitt� l'Inde.

Phileas Fogg r�pondit qu'il tiendrait compte de ces observations et
qu'il aviserait.

Vers dix heures, le guide annon�ait la station d'Allahabad. L�
reprenait la voie interrompue du chemin de fer, dont les trains
franchissent, en moins d'un jour et d'une nuit, la distance qui s�pare
Allahabad de Calcutta.

Phileas Fogg devait donc arriver � temps pour prendre un paquebot qui
ne partait que le lendemain seulement, 25 octobre, � midi, pour
Hong-Kong.

La jeune femme fut d�pos�e dans une chambre de la gare. Passepartout
fut charg� d'aller acheter pour elle divers objets de toilette, robe,
ch�le, fourrures, etc., ce qu'il trouverait. Son ma�tre lui ouvrait
un cr�dit illimit�.

Passepartout partit aussit�t et courut les rues de la ville.
Allahabad, c'est la cit� de Dieu, l'une des plus v�n�r�es de l'Inde,
en raison de ce qu'elle est b�tie au confluent de deux fleuves sacr�s,
le Gange et la Jumna, dont les eaux attirent les p�lerins de toute la
p�ninsule. On sait d'ailleurs que, suivant les l�gendes du Ramayana,
le Gange prend sa source dans le ciel, d'o�, gr�ce � Brahma, il
descend sur la terre.

Tout en faisant ses emplettes, Passepartout eut bient�t vu la ville,
autrefois d�fendue par un fort magnifique qui est devenu une prison
d'�tat. Plus de commerce, plus d'industrie dans cette cit�, jadis
industrielle et commer�ante. Passepartout, qui cherchait vainement un
magasin de nouveaut�s, comme s'il e�t �t� dans Regent-street �
quelques pas de Farmer et Co., ne trouva que chez un revendeur, vieux
juif difficultueux, les objets dont il avait besoin, une robe en
�toffe �cossaise, un vaste manteau, et une magnifique pelisse en peau
de loutre qu'il n'h�sita pas � payer soixante-quinze livres (1 875 F).
Puis, tout triomphant, il retourna � la gare.

Mrs. Aouda commen�ait � revenir � elle. Cette influence � laquelle
les pr�tres de Pillaji l'avaient soumise se dissipait peu � peu, et
ses beaux yeux reprenaient toute leur douceur indienne.

Lorsque le roi-po�te, U�af Uddaul, c�l�bre les charmes de la reine
d'Ahm�hnagara, il s'exprime ainsi :

� Sa luisante chevelure, r�guli�rement divis�e en deux parts, encadre
les contours harmonieux de ses joues d�licates et blanches, brillantes
de poli et de fra�cheur. Ses sourcils d'�b�ne ont la forme et la
puissance de l'arc de Kama, dieu d'amour, et sous ses longs cils
soyeux, dans la pupille noire de ses grands yeux limpides, nagent
comme dans les lacs sacr�s de l'Himalaya les reflets les plus purs de
la lumi�re c�leste. Fines, �gales et blanches, ses dents
resplendissent entre ses l�vres souriantes, comme des gouttes de ros�e
dans le sein mi-clos d'une fleur de grenadier. Ses oreilles mignonnes
aux courbes sym�triques, ses mains vermeilles, ses petits pieds bomb�s
et tendres comme les bourgeons du lotus, brillent de l'�clat des plus
belles perles de Ceylan, des plus beaux diamants de Golconde. Sa
mince et souple ceinture, qu'une main suffit � enserrer, rehausse
l'�l�gante cambrure de ses reins arrondis et la richesse de son buste
o� la jeunesse en fleur �tale ses plus parfaits tr�sors, et, sous les
plis soyeux de sa tunique, elle semble avoir �t� model�e en argent pur
de la main divine de Vicvacarma, l'�ternel statuaire. �

Mais, sans toute cette amplification, il suffit de dire que Mrs.
Aouda, la veuve du rajah du Bundelkund, �tait une charmante femme dans
toute l'acception europ�enne du mot. Elle parlait l'anglais avec une
grande puret�, et le guide n'avait point exag�r� en affirmant que
cette jeune Parsie avait �t� transform�e par l'�ducation.

Cependant le train allait quitter la station d'Allahabad. Le Parsi
attendait. Mr. Fogg lui r�gla son salaire au prix convenu, sans le
d�passer d'un farthing. Ceci �tonna un peu Passepartout, qui savait
tout ce que son ma�tre devait au d�vouement du guide. Le Parsi avait,
en effet, risqu� volontairement sa vie dans l'affaire de Pillaji, et
si, plus tard, les Indous l'apprenaient, il �chapperait difficilement
� leur vengeance.

Restait aussi la question de Kiouni. Que ferait-on d'un �l�phant
achet� si cher ?

Mais Phileas Fogg avait d�j� pris une r�solution � cet �gard.

� Parsi, dit-il au guide, tu as �t� serviable et d�vou�. J'ai pay�
ton service, mais non ton d�vouement. Veux-tu cet �l�phant ? Il est
� toi. �

Les yeux du guide brill�rent.

� C'est une fortune que Votre Honneur me donne ! s'�cria-t-il.

-- Accepte, guide, r�pondit Mr. Fogg, et c'est moi qui serai encore
ton d�biteur.

-- A la bonne heure ! s'�cria Passepartout. Prends, ami ! Kiouni
est un brave et courageux animal ! �

Et, allant � la b�te, il lui pr�senta quelques morceaux de sucre,
disant :

� Tiens, Kiouni, tiens, tiens ! �

L'�l�phant fit entendre quelques grognement de satisfaction. Puis,
prenant Passepartout par la ceinture et l'enroulant de sa trompe, il
l'enleva jusqu'� la hauteur de sa t�te. Passepartout, nullement
effray�, fit une bonne caresse � l'animal, qui le repla�a doucement �
terre, et, � la poign�e de trompe de l'honn�te Kiouni, r�pondit une
vigoureuse poign�e de main de l'honn�te gar�on.

Quelques instants apr�s, Phileas Fogg, Sir Francis Cromarty et
Passepartout, install�s dans un confortable wagon dont Mrs. Aouda
occupait la meilleure place, couraient � toute vapeur vers B�nar�s.

Quatre-vingts milles au plus s�parent cette ville d'Allahabad, et ils
furent franchis en deux heures.

Pendant ce trajet, la jeune femme revint compl�tement � elle ; les
vapeurs assoupissantes du hang se dissip�rent.

Quel fut son �tonnement de se trouver sur le railway, dans ce
compartiment, recouverte de v�tements europ�ens, au milieu de
voyageurs qui lui �taient absolument inconnus !

Tout d'abord, ses compagnons lui prodigu�rent leurs soins et la
ranim�rent avec quelques gouttes de liqueur ; puis le brigadier
g�n�ral lui raconta son histoire. Il insista sur le d�vouement de
Phileas Fogg, qui n'avait pas h�sit� � jouer sa vie pour la sauver, et
sur le d�nouement de l'aventure, d� � l'audacieuse imagination de
Passepartout.

Mr. Fogg laissa dire sans prononcer une parole. Passepartout, tout
honteux, r�p�tait que � �a n'en valait pas la peine �!

Mrs. Aouda remercia ses sauveurs avec effusion, par ses larmes plus
que par ses paroles. Ses beaux yeux, mieux que ses l�vres, furent les
interpr�tes de sa reconnaissance. Puis, sa pens�e la reportant aux
sc�nes du sutty, ses regards revoyant cette terre indienne o� tant de
dangers l'attendaient encore, elle fut prise d'un frisson de terreur.

Phileas Fogg comprit ce qui se passait dans l'esprit de Mrs. Aouda,
et, pour la rassurer, il lui offrit, tr�s froidement d'ailleurs, de la
conduire � Hong-Kong, o� elle demeurerait jusqu'� ce que cette affaire
f�t assoupie.

Mrs. Aouda accepta l'offre avec reconnaissance. Pr�cis�ment, �
Hong-Kong, r�sidait un de ses parents, Parsi comme elle, et l'un des
principaux n�gociants de cette ville, qui est absolument anglaise,
tout en occupant un point de la c�te chinoise.

A midi et demi, le train s'arr�tait � la station de B�nar�s. Les
l�gendes brahmaniques affirment que cette ville occupe l'emplacement
de l'ancienne Casi, qui �tait autrefois suspendue dans l'espace, entre
le z�nith et le nadir, comme la tombe de Mahomet. Mais, � cette
�poque plus r�aliste, B�nar�s, Ath�nes de l'Inde au dire des
orientalistes, reposait tout prosa�quement sur le sol, et Passepartout
put un instant entrevoir ses maisons de briques, ses huttes en
clayonnage, qui lui donnaient un aspect absolument d�sol�, sans aucune
couleur locale.

C'�tait l� que devait s'arr�ter Sir Francis Cromarty. Les troupes
qu'il rejoignait campaient � quelques milles au nord de la ville. Le
brigadier g�n�ral fit donc ses adieux � Phileas Fogg, lui souhaitant
tout le succ�s possible, et exprimant le voeu qu'il recommen��t ce
voyage d'une fa�on moins originale, mais plus profitable. Mr. Fogg
pressa l�g�rement les doigts de son compagnon. Les compliments de
Mrs. Aouda furent plus affectueux. Jamais elle n'oublierait ce
qu'elle devait � Sir Francis Cromarty. Quant � Passepartout, il fut
honor� d'une vraie poign�e de main de la part du brigadier g�n�ral.
Tout �mu, il se demanda o� et quand il pourrait bien se d�vouer pour
lui. Puis on se s�para.

A partir de B�nar�s, la voie ferr�e suivait en partie la vall�e du
Gange. A travers les vitres du wagon, par un temps assez clair,
apparaissait le paysage vari� du B�har, puis des montagnes couvertes
de verdure, les champs d'orge, de ma�s et de froment, des rios et des
�tangs peupl�s d'alligators verd�tres, des villages bien entretenus,
des for�ts encore verdoyantes. Quelques �l�phants, des z�bus � grosse
bosse venaient se baigner dans les eaux du fleuve sacr�, et aussi,
malgr� la saison avanc�e et la temp�rature d�j� froide, des bandes
d'Indous des deux sexes, qui accomplissaient pieusement leurs saintes
ablutions. Ces fid�les, ennemis acharn�s du bouddhisme, sont
sectateurs fervents de la religion brahmanique, qui s'incarne en ces
trois personnes : Whisnou, la divinit� solaire, Shiva, la
personnification divine des forces naturelles, et Brahma, le ma�tre
supr�me des pr�tres et des l�gislateurs. Mais de quel oeil Brahma,
Shiva et Whisnou devaient-ils consid�rer cette Inde, maintenant �
britannis�e �, lorsque quelque steam-boat passait en hennissant et
troublait les eaux consacr�es du Gange, effarouchant les mouettes qui
volaient � sa surface, les tortues qui pullulaient sur ses bords, et
les d�vots �tendus au long de ses rives !

Tout ce panorama d�fila comme un �clair, et souvent un nuage de vapeur
blanche en cacha les d�tails. A peine les voyageurs purent-ils
entrevoir le fort de Chunar, � vingt milles au sud-est de B�nar�s,
ancienne forteresse des rajahs du B�har, Ghazepour et ses importantes
fabriques d'eau de rose, le tombeau de Lord Cornwallis qui s'�l�ve sur
la rive gauche du Gange, la ville fortifi�e de Buxar, Patna, grande
cit� industrielle et commer�ante, o� se tient le principal march�
d'opium de l'Inde, Monghir, ville plus qu'europ�enne, anglaise comme
Manchester ou Birmingham, renomm�e pour ses fonderies de fer, ses
fabriques de taillanderie et d'armes blanches, et dont les hautes
chemin�es encrassaient d'une fum�e noire le ciel de Brahma, -- un
v�ritable coup de poing dans le pays du r�ve !

Puis la nuit vint et, au milieu des hurlements des tigres, des ours,
des loups qui fuyaient devant la locomotive, le train passa � toute
vitesse, et on n'aper�ut plus rien des merveilles du Bengale, ni
Golgonde, ni Gour en ruine, ni Mourshedabad, qui fut autrefois
capitale, ni Burdwan, ni Hougly, ni Chandernagor, ce point fran�ais du
territoire indien sur lequel Passepartout e�t �t� fier de voir flotter
le drapeau de sa patrie !

Enfin, � sept heures du matin, Calcutta �tait atteint. Le paquebot,
en partance pour Hong-Kong, ne levait l'ancre qu'� midi. Phileas Fogg
avait donc cinq heures devant lui.

D'apr�s son itin�raire, ce gentleman devait arriver dans la capitale
des Indes le 25 octobre, vingt-trois jours apr�s avoir quitt� Londres,
et il y arrivait au jour fix�. Il n'avait donc ni retard ni avance.
Malheureusement, les deux jours gagn�s par lui entre Londres et Bombay
avaient �t� perdus, on sait comment, dans cette travers�e de la
p�ninsule indienne, -- mais il est � supposer que Phileas Fogg ne les
regrettait pas.

                                  XV
                         --------------------
             O� LE SAC AUX BANK-NOTES S'ALL�GE ENCORE DE
                     QUELQUES MILLIERS DE LIVRES

Le train s'�tait arr�t� en gare. Passepartout descendit le premier du
wagon, et fut suivi de Mr. Fogg, qui aida sa jeune compagne � mettre
pied sur le quai. Phileas Fogg comptait se rendre directement au
paquebot de Hong-Kong, afin d'y installer confortablement Mrs. Aouda,
qu'il ne voulait pas quitter, tant qu'elle serait en ce pays si
dangereux pour elle.

Au moment o� Mr. Fogg allait sortir de la gare, un policeman
s'approcha de lui et dit :

� Monsieur Phileas Fogg ?

-- C'est moi.

-- Cet homme est votre domestique ? ajouta le policeman en d�signant
Passepartout.

-- Oui.

-- Veuillez me suivre tous les deux. �

Mr. Fogg ne fit pas un mouvement qui p�t marquer en lui une surprise
quelconque. Cet agent �tait un repr�sentant de la loi, et, pour tout
Anglais, la loi est sacr�e. Passepartout, avec ses habitudes
fran�aises, voulut raisonner, mais le policeman le toucha de sa
baguette, et Phileas Fogg lui fit signe d'ob�ir.

� Cette jeune dame peut nous accompagner ? demanda Mr. Fogg.

-- Elle le peut �, r�pondit le policeman.

Le policeman conduisit Mr. Fogg, Mrs. Aouda et Passepartout vers un
palki-ghari, sorte de voiture � quatre roues et � quatre places,
attel�e de deux chevaux. On partit. Personne ne parla pendant le
trajet, qui dura vingt minutes environ.

La voiture traversa d'abord la � ville noire �, aux rues �troites,
bord�es de cahutes dans lesquelles grouillait une population
cosmopolite, sale et d�guenill�e ; puis elle passa � travers la ville
europ�enne, �gay�e de maisons de briques, ombrag�e de cocotiers,
h�riss�e de m�tures, que parcouraient d�j�, malgr� l'heure matinale,
des cavaliers �l�gants et de magnifiques attelages.

Le palki-ghari s'arr�ta devant une habitation d'apparence simple, mais
qui ne devait pas �tre affect�e aux usages domestiques. Le policeman
fit descendre ses prisonniers -- on pouvait vraiment leur donner ce
nom --, et il les conduisit dans une chambre aux fen�tres grill�es, en
leur disant :

� C'est � huit heures et demie que vous compara�trez devant le juge
Obadiah. �

Puis il se retira et ferma la porte.

� Allons ! nous sommes pris ! � s'�cria Passepartout, en se laissant
aller sur une chaise.

Mrs. Aouda, s'adressant aussit�t � Mr. Fogg, lui dit d'une voix dont
elle cherchait en vain � d�guiser l'�motion :

� Monsieur, il faut m'abandonner ! C'est pour moi que vous �tes
poursuivi ! C'est pour m'avoir sauv�e ! �

Phileas Fogg se contenta de r�pondre que cela n'�tait pas possible.
Poursuivi pour cette affaire du sutty ! Inadmissible ! Comment les
plaignants oseraient-ils se pr�senter ? Il y avait m�prise. Mr.
Fogg ajouta que, dans tous les cas, il n'abandonnerait pas la jeune
femme, et qu'il la conduirait � Hong-Kong.

� Mais le bateau part � midi ! fit observer Passepartout.

-- Avant midi nous serons � bord �, r�pondit simplement l'impassible
gentleman.

Cela fut affirm� si nettement, que Passepartout ne put s'emp�cher de
se dire � lui-m�me :

� Parbleu ! cela est certain ! avant midi nous serons � bord ! �
Mais il n'�tait pas rassur� du tout.

A huit heures et demie, la porte de la chambre s'ouvrit. Le policeman
reparut, et il introduisit les prisonniers dans la salle voisine.
C'�tait une salle d'audience, et un public assez nombreux, compos�
d'Europ�ens et d'indig�nes, en occupait d�j� le pr�toire.

Mr. Fogg, Mrs. Aouda et Passepartout s'assirent sur un banc en face
des si�ges r�serv�s au magistrat et au greffier.

Ce magistrat, le juge Obadiah, entra presque aussit�t, suivi du
greffier. C'�tait un gros homme tout rond. Il d�crocha une perruque
pendue � un clou et s'en coiffa lestement.

� La premi�re cause �, dit-il.

Mais, portant la main � sa t�te :

� H� ! ce n'est pas ma perruque !

-- En effet, monsieur Obadiah, c'est la mienne, r�pondit le greffier.

-- Cher monsieur Oysterpuf, comment voulez-vous qu'un juge puisse
rendre une bonne sentence avec la perruque d'un greffier ! �

L'�change des perruques fut fait. Pendant ces pr�liminaires,
Passepartout bouillait d'impatience, car l'aiguille lui paraissait
marcher terriblement vite sur le cadran de la grosse horloge du
pr�toire.

� La premi�re cause, reprit alors le juge Obadiah.

-- Phileas Fogg ? dit le greffier Oysterpuf.

-- Me voici, r�pondit Mr. Fogg.

-- Passepartout ?

-- Pr�sent ! r�pondit Passepartout.

-- Bien ! dit le juge Obadiah. Voil� deux jours, accus�s, que l'on
vous guette � tous les trains de Bombay.

-- Mais de quoi nous accuse-t-on ? s'�cria Passepartout, impatient�.

-- Vous allez le savoir, r�pondit le juge.

-- Monsieur, dit alors Mr. Fogg, je suis citoyen anglais, et j'ai
droit...

-- Vous a-t-on manqu� d'�gards ? demanda Mr. Obadiah.

-- Aucunement.

-- Bien ! faites entrer les plaignants. �

Sur l'ordre du juge, une porte s'ouvrit, et trois pr�tres indous
furent introduits par un huissier.

� C'est bien cela ! murmura Passepartout, ce sont ces coquins qui
voulaient br�ler notre jeune dame ! �

Les pr�tres se tinrent debout devant le juge, et le greffier lut �
haute voix une plainte en sacril�ge, formul�e contre le sieur Phileas
Fogg et son domestique, accus�s d'avoir viol� un lieu consacr� par la
religion brahmanique.

� Vous avez entendu ? demanda le juge � Phileas Fogg.

-- Oui, monsieur, r�pondit Mr. Fogg en consultant sa montre, et
j'avoue.

-- Ah ! vous avouez ?...

-- J'avoue et j'attends que ces trois pr�tres avouent � leur tour ce
qu'ils voulaient faire � la pagode de Pillaji. �

Les pr�tres se regard�rent. Ils semblaient ne rien comprendre aux
paroles de l'accus�.

� Sans doute ! s'�cria imp�tueusement Passepartout, � cette pagode de
Pillaji, devant laquelle ils allaient br�ler leur victime ! �

Nouvelle stup�faction des pr�tres, et profond �tonnement du juge
Obadiah.

� Quelle victime ? demanda-t-il. Br�ler qui ! En pleine ville de
Bombay ?

-- Bombay ? s'�cria Passepartout.

-- Sans doute. Il ne s'agit pas de la pagode de Pillaji, mais de la
pagode de Malebar-Hill, � Bombay.

-- Et comme pi�ce de conviction, voici les souliers du profanateur,
ajouta le greffier, en posant une paire de chaussures sur son bureau.

-- Mes souliers ! � s'�cria Passepartout, qui, surpris au dernier
chef, ne put retenir cette involontaire exclamation.

On devine la confusion qui s'�tait op�r�e dans l'esprit du ma�tre et
du domestique. Cet incident de la pagode de Bombay, ils l'avaient
oubli�, et c'�tait celui-l� m�me qui les amenait devant le magistrat
de Calcutta.

En effet, l'agent Fix avait compris tout le parti qu'il pouvait tirer
de cette malencontreuse affaire. Retardant son d�part de douze
heures, il s'�tait fait le conseil des pr�tres de Malebar-Hill ; il
leur avait promis des dommages-int�r�ts consid�rables, sachant bien
que le gouvernement anglais se montrait tr�s s�v�re pour ce genre de
d�lit ; puis, par le train suivant, il les avait lanc�s sur les traces
du sacril�ge. Mais, par suite du temps employ� � la d�livrance de la
jeune veuve, Fix et les Indous arriv�rent � Calcutta avant Phileas
Fogg et son domestique, que les magistrats, pr�venus par d�p�che,
devaient arr�ter � leur descente du train. Que l'on juge du
d�sappointement de Fix, quand il apprit que Phileas Fogg n'�tait point
encore arriv� dans la capitale de l'Inde. Il dut croire que son
voleur, s'arr�tant � une des stations du Peninsular-railway, s'�tait
r�fugi� dans les provinces septentrionales. Pendant vingt-quatre
heures, au milieu de mortelles inqui�tudes, Fix le guetta � la gare.
Quelle fut donc sa joie quand, ce matin m�me, il le vit descendre du
wagon, en compagnie, il est vrai, d'une jeune femme dont il ne pouvait
s'expliquer la pr�sence. Aussit�t il lan�a sur lui un policeman, et
voil� comment Mr. Fogg, Passepartout et la veuve du rajah du
Bundelkund furent conduits devant le juge Obadiah.

Et si Passepartout e�t �t� moins pr�occup� de son affaire, il aurait
aper�u, dans un coin du pr�toire, le d�tective, qui suivait le d�bat
avec un int�r�t facile � comprendre, -- car � Calcutta, comme �
Bombay, comme � Suez, le mandat d'arrestation lui manquait encore !

Cependant le juge Obadiah avait pris acte de l'aveu �chapp� �
Passepartout, qui aurait donn� tout ce qu'il poss�dait pour reprendre
ses imprudentes paroles.

� Les faits sont avou�s ? dit le juge.

-- Avou�s, r�pondit froidement Mr. Fogg.

-- Attendu, reprit le juge, attendu que la loi anglaise entend
prot�ger �galement et rigoureusement toutes les religions des
populations de l'Inde, le d�lit �tant avou� par le sieur Passepartout,
convaincu d'avoir viol� d'un pied sacril�ge le pav� de la pagode de
Malebar-Hill, � Bombay, dans la journ�e du 20 octobre, condamne ledit
Passepartout � quinze jours de prison et � une amende de trois cents
livres (7 500 F).

-- Trois cents livres ? s'�cria Passepartout, qui n'�tait
v�ritablement sensible qu'� l'amende.

-- Silence ! fit l'huissier d'une voix glapissante.

-- Et, ajouta le juge Obadiah, attendu qu'il n'est pas mat�riellement
prouv� qu'il n'y ait pas connivence entre le domestique et le ma�tre,
qu'en tout cas celui-ci doit �tre tenu responsable des gestes d'un
serviteur � ses gages, retient ledit Phileas Fogg et le condamne �
huit jours de prison et cent cinquante livres d'amende. Greffier,
appelez une autre cause ! �

Fix, dans son coin, �prouvait une indicible satisfaction. Phileas
Fogg retenu huit jours � Calcutta, c'�tait plus qu'il n'en fallait
pour donner au mandat le temps de lui arriver.

Passepartout �tait abasourdi. Cette condamnation ruinait son ma�tre.
Un pari de vingt mille livres perdu, et tout cela parce que, en vrai
badaud, il �tait entr� dans cette maudite pagode !

Phileas Fogg, aussi ma�tre de lui que si cette condamnation ne l'e�t
pas concern�, n'avait pas m�me fronc� le sourcil. Mais au moment o�
le greffier appelait une autre cause, il se leva et dit :

� J'offre caution.

-- C'est votre droit �, r�pondit le juge.

Fix se sentit froid dans le dos, mais il reprit son assurance, quand
il entendit le juge, � attendu la qualit� d'�trangers de Phileas Fogg
et de son domestique �, fixer la caution pour chacun d'eux � la somme
�norme de mille livres (25 000 F).

C'�tait deux mille livres qu'il en co�terait � Mr. Fogg, s'il ne
purgeait pas sa condamnation.

� Je paie �, dit ce gentleman.

Et du sac que portait Passepartout, il retira un paquet de bank-notes
qu'il d�posa sur le bureau du greffier.

� Cette somme vous sera restitu�e � votre sortie de prison, dit le
juge. En attendant, vous �tes libres sous caution.

-- Venez, dit Phileas Fogg � son domestique.

-- Mais, au moins, qu'ils rendent les souliers ! � s'�cria
Passepartout avec un mouvement de rage.

On lui rendit ses souliers.

� En voil� qui co�tent cher ! murmura-t-il. Plus de mille livres
chacun ! Sans compter qu'ils me g�nent ! �

Passepartout, absolument piteux, suivit Mr. Fogg, qui avait offert
son bras � la jeune femme. Fix esp�rait encore que son voleur ne se
d�ciderait jamais � abandonner cette somme de deux mille livres et
qu'il ferait ses huit jours de prison. Il se jeta donc sur les traces
de Fogg.

Mr. Fogg prit une voiture, dans laquelle Mrs. Aouda, Passepartout et
lui mont�rent aussit�t. Fix courut derri�re la voiture, qui s'arr�ta
bient�t sur l'un des quais de la ville.

A un demi-mille en rade, le _Rangoon_ �tait mouill�, son pavillon de
partance hiss� en t�te de m�t. Onze heures sonnaient. Mr. Fogg
�tait en avance d'une heure. Fix le vit descendre de voiture et
s'embarquer dans un canot avec Mrs. Aouda et son domestique. Le
d�tective frappa la terre du pied.

� Le gueux ! s'�cria-t-il, il part ! Deux mille livres sacrifi�es !
Prodigue comme un voleur ! Ah ! je le filerai jusqu'au bout du monde
s'il le faut ; mais du train dont il va, tout l'argent du vol y aura
pass�! �

L'inspecteur de police �tait fond� � faire cette r�flexion. En effet,
depuis qu'il avait quitt� Londres, tant en frais de voyage qu'en
primes, en achat d'�l�phant, en cautions et en amendes, Phileas Fogg
avait d�j� sem� plus de cinq mille livres (125 000 F) sur sa route, et
le tant pour cent de la somme recouvr�e, attribu� aux d�tectives,
allait diminuant toujours.

                                 XVI
                         --------------------
            O� FIX N'A PAS L'AIR DE CONNA�TRE DU TOUT LES
                       CHOSES DONT ON LUI PARLE

Le _Rangoon_, l'un des paquebots que la Compagnie p�ninsulaire et
orientale emploie au service des mers de la Chine et du Japon, �tait
un steamer en fer, � h�lice, jaugeant brut dix-sept cent soixante-dix
tonnes, et d'une force nominale de quatre cents chevaux. Il �galait
le _Mongolia_ en vitesse, mais non en confortable. Aussi Mrs. Aouda
ne fut-elle point aussi bien install�e que l'e�t d�sir� Phileas Fogg.
Apr�s tout, il ne s'agissait que d'une travers�e de trois mille cinq
cents milles, soit de onze � douze jours, et la jeune femme ne se
montra pas une difficile passag�re.

Pendant les premiers jours de cette travers�e, Mrs. Aouda fit plus
ample connaissance avec Phileas Fogg. En toute occasion, elle lui
t�moignait la plus vive reconnaissance. Le flegmatique gentleman
l'�coutait, en apparence au moins, avec la plus extr�me froideur, sans
qu'une intonation, un geste d�cel�t en lui la plus l�g�re �motion. Il
veillait � ce que rien ne manqu�t � la jeune femme. A de certaines
heures il venait r�guli�rement, sinon causer, du moins l'�couter. Il
accomplissait envers elle les devoirs de la politesse la plus stricte,
mais avec la gr�ce et l'impr�vu d'un automate dont les mouvements
auraient �t� combin�s pour cet usage. Mrs. Aouda ne savait trop que
penser, mais Passepartout lui avait un peu expliqu� l'excentrique
personnalit� de son ma�tre. Il lui avait appris quelle gageure
entra�nait ce gentleman autour du monde. Mrs. Aouda avait souri ;
mais apr�s tout, elle lui devait la vie, et son sauveur ne pouvait
perdre � ce qu'elle le v�t � travers sa reconnaissance.

Mrs. Aouda confirma le r�cit que le guide indou avait fait de sa
touchante histoire. Elle �tait, en effet, de cette race qui tient le
premier rang parmi les races indig�nes. Plusieurs n�gociants parsis
ont fait de grandes fortunes aux Indes, dans le commerce des cotons.
L'un d'eux, Sir James Jejeebhoy, a �t� anobli par le gouvernement
anglais, et Mrs. Aouda �tait parente de ce riche personnage qui
habitait Bombay. C'�tait m�me un cousin de Sir Jejeebhoy, l'honorable
Jejeeh, qu'elle comptait rejoindre � Hong-Kong. Trouverait-elle pr�s
de lui refuge et assistance ? Elle ne pouvait l'affirmer. A quoi Mr.
Fogg r�pondait qu'elle n'e�t pas � s'inqui�ter, et que tout
s'arrangerait math�matiquement ! Ce fut son mot.

La jeune femme comprenait-elle cet horrible adverbe ? On ne sait.
Toutefois, ses grands yeux se fixaient sur ceux de Mr. Fogg, ses
grands yeux � limpides comme les lacs sacr�s de l'Himalaya � ! Mais
l'intraitable Fogg, aussi boutonn� que jamais, ne semblait point homme
� se jeter dans ce lac.

Cette premi�re partie de la travers�e du _Rangoon_ s'accomplit dans
des conditions excellentes. Le temps �tait maniable. Toute cette
portion de l'immense baie que les marins appellent les � brasses du
Bengale � se montra favorable � la marche du paquebot. Le _Rangoon_
eut bient�t connaissance du Grand-Andaman, la principale du groupe,
que sa pittoresque montagne de Saddle-Peak, haute de deux mille quatre
cents pieds, signale de fort loin aux navigateurs.

La c�te fut prolong�e d'assez pr�s. Les sauvages Papouas de l'�le ne
se montr�rent point. Ce sont des �tres plac�s au dernier degr� de
l'�chelle humaine, mais dont on fait � tort des anthropophages.

Le d�veloppement panoramique de ces �les �tait superbe. D'immenses
for�ts de lataniers, d'arecs, de bambousiers, de muscadiers, de tecks,
de gigantesques mimos�es, de foug�res arborescentes, couvraient le
pays en premier plan, et en arri�re se profilait l'�l�gante silhouette
des montagnes. Sur la c�te pullulaient par milliers ces pr�cieuses
salanganes, dont les nids comestibles forment un mets recherch� dans
le C�leste Empire. Mais tout ce spectacle vari�, offert aux regards
par le groupe des Andaman, passa vite, et le _Rangoon_ s'achemina
rapidement vers le d�troit de Malacca, qui devait lui donner acc�s
dans les mers de la Chine.

Que faisait pendant cette travers�e l'inspecteur Fix, si
malencontreusement entra�n� dans un voyage de circumnavigation ? Au
d�part de Calcutta, apr�s avoir laiss� des instructions pour que le
mandat, s'il arrivait enfin, lui f�t adress� � Hong-Kong, il avait pu
s'embarquer � bord du _Rangoon_ sans avoir �t� aper�u de Passepartout,
et il esp�rait bien dissimuler sa pr�sence jusqu'� l'arriv�e du
paquebot. En effet, il lui e�t �t� difficile d'expliquer pourquoi il
se trouvait � bord, sans �veiller les soup�ons de Passepartout, qui
devait le croire � Bombay. Mais il fut amen� � renouer connaissance
avec l'honn�te gar�on par la logique m�me des circonstances.
Comment ? On va le voir.

Toutes les esp�rances, tous les d�sirs de l'inspecteur de police,
�taient maintenant concentr�s sur un unique point du monde, Hong-Kong,
car le paquebot s'arr�tait trop peu de temps � Singapore pour qu'il
p�t op�rer en cette ville. C'�tait donc � Hong-Kong que l'arrestation
du voleur devait se faire, ou le voleur lui �chappait, pour ainsi
dire, sans retour.

En effet, Hong-Kong �tait encore une terre anglaise, mais la derni�re
qui se rencontr�t sur le parcours. Au-del�, la Chine, le Japon,
l'Am�rique offraient un refuge � peu pr�s assur� au sieur Fogg. A
Hong-Kong, s'il y trouvait enfin le mandat d'arrestation qui courait
�videmment apr�s lui, Fix arr�tait Fogg et le remettait entre les
mains de la police locale. Nulle difficult�. Mais apr�s Hong-Kong,
un simple mandat d'arrestation ne suffirait plus. Il faudrait un acte
d'extradition. De l� retards, lenteurs, obstacles de toute nature,
dont le coquin profiterait pour �chapper d�finitivement. Si
l'op�ration manquait � Hong-Kong, il serait, sinon impossible, du
moins bien difficile, de la reprendre avec quelque chance de succ�s.

� Donc, se r�p�tait Fix pendant ces longues heures qu'il passait dans
sa cabine, donc, ou le mandat sera � Hong-Kong, et j'arr�te mon homme,
ou il n'y sera pas, et cette fois il faut � tout prix que je retarde
son d�part ! J'ai �chou� � Bombay, j'ai �chou� � Calcutta ! Si je
manque mon coup � Hong-Kong, je suis perdu de r�putation ! Co�te que
co�te, il faut r�ussir. Mais quel moyen employer pour retarder, si
cela est n�cessaire, le d�part de ce maudit Fogg ? �

En dernier ressort, Fix �tait bien d�cid� � tout avouer �
Passepartout, � lui faire conna�tre ce ma�tre qu'il servait et dont il
n'�tait certainement pas le complice. Passepartout, �clair� par cette
r�v�lation, devant craindre d'�tre compromis, se rangerait sans doute
� lui, Fix. Mais enfin c'�tait un moyen hasardeux, qui ne pouvait
�tre employ� qu'� d�faut de tout autre. Un mot de Passepartout � son
ma�tre e�t suffi � compromettre irr�vocablement l'affaire.

L'inspecteur de police �tait donc extr�mement embarrass�, quand la
pr�sence de Mrs. Aouda � bord du _Rangoon_, en compagnie de Phileas
Fogg, lui ouvrit de nouvelles perspectives.

Quelle �tait cette femme ? Quel concours de circonstances en avait
fait la compagne de Fogg ? C'�tait �videmment entre Bombay et
Calcutta que la rencontre avait eu lieu. Mais en quel point de la
p�ninsule ? �tait-ce le hasard qui avait r�uni Phileas Fogg et la
jeune voyageuse ? Ce voyage � travers l'Inde, au contraire,
n'avait-il pas �t� entrepris par ce gentleman dans le but de rejoindre
cette charmante personne ? car elle �tait charmante ! Fix l'avait
bien vu dans la salle d'audience du tribunal de Calcutta.

On comprend � quel point l'agent devait �tre intrigu�. Il se demanda
s'il n'y avait pas dans cette affaire quelque criminel enl�vement.
Oui ! cela devait �tre ! Cette id�e s'incrusta dans le cerveau de
Fix, et il reconnut tout le parti qu'il pouvait tirer de cette
circonstance. Que cette jeune femme f�t mari�e ou non, il y avait
enl�vement, et il �tait possible, � Hong-Kong, de susciter au
ravisseur des embarras tels, qu'il ne p�t s'en tirer � prix d'argent.

Mais il ne fallait pas attendre l'arriv�e du _Rangoon_ � Hong-Kong.
Ce Fogg avait la d�testable habitude de sauter d'un bateau dans un
autre, et, avant que l'affaire f�t entam�e, il pouvait �tre d�j� loin.

L'important �tait donc de pr�venir les autorit�s anglaises et de
signaler le passage du _Rangoon_ avant son d�barquement. Or, rien
n'�tait plus facile, puisque le paquebot faisait escale � Singapore,
et que Singapore est reli�e � la c�te chinoise par un fil
t�l�graphique.

Toutefois, avant d'agir et pour op�rer plus s�rement, Fix r�solut
d'interroger Passepartout. Il savait qu'il n'�tait pas tr�s difficile
de faire parler ce gar�on, et il se d�cida � rompre l'incognito qu'il
avait gard� jusqu'alors. Or, il n'y avait pas de temps � perdre. On
�tait au 30 octobre, et le lendemain m�me le _Rangoon_ devait rel�cher
� Singapore.

Donc, ce jour-l�, Fix, sortant de sa cabine, monta sur le pont, dans
l'intention d'aborder Passepartout � le premier � avec les marques de
la plus extr�me surprise. Passepartout se promenait � l'avant, quand
l'inspecteur se pr�cipita vers lui, s'�criant :

� Vous, sur le _Rangoon_ !

-- Monsieur Fix � bord ! r�pondit Passepartout, absolument surpris,
en reconnaissant son compagnon de travers�e du _Mongolia_. Quoi ! je
vous laisse � Bombay, et je vous retrouve sur la route de Hong-Kong !
Mais vous faites donc, vous aussi, le tour du monde ?

-- Non, non, r�pondit Fix, et je compte m'arr�ter � Hong-Kong, -- au
moins quelques jours.

-- Ah ! dit Passepartout, qui parut un instant �tonn�. Mais comment
ne vous ai-je pas aper�u � bord depuis notre d�part de Calcutta ?

-- Ma foi, un malaise... un peu de mal de mer... Je suis rest�
couch� dans ma cabine... Le golfe du Bengale ne me r�ussit pas aussi
bien que l'oc�an Indien. Et votre ma�tre, Mr. Phileas Fogg ?

-- En parfaite sant�, et aussi ponctuel que son itin�raire ! Pas un
jour de retard ! Ah ! monsieur Fix, vous ne savez pas cela, vous,
mais nous avons aussi une jeune dame avec nous.

-- Une jeune dame ? � r�pondit l'agent, qui avait parfaitement l'air
de ne pas comprendre ce que son interlocuteur voulait dire.

Mais Passepartout l'eut bient�t mis au courant de son histoire. Il
raconta l'incident de la pagode de Bombay, l'acquisition de l'�l�phant
au prix de deux mille livres, l'affaire du sutty, l'enl�vement
d'Aouda, la condamnation du tribunal de Calcutta, la libert� sous
caution. Fix, qui connaissait la derni�re partie de ces incidents,
semblait les ignorer tous, et Passepartout se laissait aller au charme
de narrer ses aventures devant un auditeur qui lui marquait tant
d'int�r�t.

� Mais, en fin de compte, demanda Fix, est-ce que votre ma�tre a
l'intention d'emmener cette jeune femme en Europe ?

-- Non pas, monsieur Fix, non pas ! Nous allons tout simplement la
remettre aux soins de l'un de ses parents, riche n�gociant de
Hong-Kong. �

� Rien � faire ! � se dit le d�tective en dissimulant son
d�sappointement. � Un verre de gin, monsieur Passepartout ?

-- Volontiers, monsieur Fix. C'est bien le moins que nous buvions �
notre rencontre � bord du _Rangoon_ ! �

                                 XVII
                         --------------------
    O� IL EST QUESTION DE CHOSES ET D'AUTRES PENDANT LA TRAVERS�E
                       DE SINGAPORE A HONG-KONG

Depuis ce jour, Passepartout et le d�tective se rencontr�rent
fr�quemment, mais l'agent se tint dans une extr�me r�serve vis-�-vis
de son compagnon, et il n'essaya point de le faire parler. Une ou
deux fois seulement, il entrevit Mr. Fogg, qui restait volontiers
dans le grand salon du _Rangoon_, soit qu'il t�nt compagnie � Mrs.
Aouda, soit qu'il jou�t au whist, suivant son invariable habitude.

Quant � Passepartout, il s'�tait pris tr�s s�rieusement � m�diter sur
le singulier hasard qui avait mis, encore une fois, Fix sur la route
de son ma�tre. Et, en effet, on e�t �t� �tonn� � moins. Ce
gentleman, tr�s aimable, tr�s complaisant � coup s�r, que l'on
rencontre d'abord � Suez, qui s'embarque sur le _Mongolia_, qui
d�barque � Bombay, o� il dit devoir s�journer, que l'on retrouve sur
le _Rangoon_, faisant route pour Hong-Kong, en un mot, suivant pas �
pas l'itin�raire de Mr. Fogg, cela valait la peine qu'on y r�fl�ch�t.
Il y avait l� une concordance au moins bizarre.  A qui en avait ce
Fix ? Passepartout �tait pr�t a parier ses babouches -- il les avait
pr�cieusement conserv�es -- que le Fix quitterait Hong-Kong en m�me
temps qu'eux, et probablement sur le m�me paquebot.

Passepartout e�t r�fl�chi pendant un si�cle, qu'il n'aurait jamais
devin� de quelle mission l'agent avait �t� charg�. Jamais il n'e�t
imagin� que Phileas Fogg f�t � fil� �, � la fa�on d'un voleur, autour
du globe terrestre. Mais comme il est dans la nature humaine de
donner une explication � toute chose, voici comment Passepartout,
soudainement illumin�, interpr�ta la pr�sence permanente de Fix, et,
vraiment, son interpr�tation �tait fort plausible. En effet, suivant
lui, Fix n'�tait et ne pouvait �tre qu'un agent lanc� sur les traces
de Mr. Fogg par ses coll�gues du Reform-Club, afin de constater que
ce voyage s'accomplissait r�guli�rement autour du monde, suivant
l'itin�raire convenu.

� C'est �vident ! c'est �vident ! se r�p�tait l'honn�te gar�on, tout
fier de sa perspicacit�. C'est un espion que ces gentlemen ont mis �
nos trousses ! Voil� qui n'est pas digne ! Mr. Fogg si probe, si
honorable ! Le faire �pier par un agent ! Ah ! messieurs du
Reform-Club, cela vous co�tera cher ! �

Passepartout, enchant� de sa d�couverte, r�solut cependant de n'en
rien dire � son ma�tre, craignant que celui-ci ne f�t justement bless�
de cette d�fiance que lui montraient ses adversaires. Mais il se
promit bien de gouailler Fix � l'occasion, � mots couverts et sans se
compromettre.

Le mercredi 30 octobre, dans l'apr�s-midi, le _Rangoon_ embouquait le
d�troit de Malacca, qui s�pare la presqu'�le de ce nom des terres de
Sumatra. Des �lots montagneux tr�s escarp�s, tr�s pittoresques
d�robaient aux passagers la vue de la grande �le.

Le lendemain, � quatre heures du matin, le _Rangoon_, ayant gagn� une
demi-journ�e sur sa travers�e r�glementaire, rel�chait � Singapore,
afin d'y renouveler sa provision de charbon.

Phileas Fogg inscrivit cette avance � la colonne des gains, et, cette
fois, il descendit � terre, accompagnant Mrs. Aouda, qui avait
manifest� le d�sir de se promener pendant quelques heures.

Fix, � qui toute action de Fogg paraissait suspecte, le suivit sans se
laisser apercevoir. Quant � Passepartout, qui riait _in petto_ � voir
la manoeuvre de Fix, il alla faire ses emplettes ordinaires.

L'�le de Singapore n'est ni grande ni imposante l'aspect. Les
montagnes, c'est-�-dire les profils, lui manquent. Toutefois, elle
est charmante dans sa maigreur. C'est un parc coup� de belles routes.
Un joli �quipage, attel� de ces chevaux �l�gants qui ont �t� import�s
de la Nouvelle-Hollande, transporta Mrs. Aouda et Phileas Fogg au
milieu des massifs de palmiers � l'�clatant feuillage, et de
girofliers dont les clous sont form�s du bouton m�me de la fleur
entrouverte. L�, les buissons de poivriers rempla�aient les haies
�pineuses des campagnes europ�ennes ; des sagoutiers, de grandes
foug�res avec leur ramure superbe, variaient l'aspect de cette r�gion
tropicale ; des muscadiers au feuillage verni saturaient l'air d'un
parfum p�n�trant. Les singes, bandes alertes et grima�antes, ne
manquaient pas dans les bois, ni peut-�tre les tigres dans les
jungles. A qui s'�tonnerait d'apprendre que dans cette �le, si petite
relativement, ces terribles carnassiers ne fussent pas d�truits
jusqu'au dernier, on r�pondra qu'ils viennent de Malacca, en
traversant le d�troit � la nage.

Apr�s avoir parcouru la campagne pendant deux heures, Mrs. Aouda et
son compagnon -- qui regardait un peu sans voir -- rentr�rent dans la
ville, vaste agglom�ration de maisons lourdes et �cras�es,
qu'entourent de charmants jardins o� poussent des mangoustes, des
ananas et tous les meilleurs fruits du monde.

A dix heures, ils revenaient au paquebot, apr�s avoir �t� suivis, sans
s'en douter, par l'inspecteur, qui avait d� lui aussi se mettre en
frais d'�quipage.

Passepartout les attendait sur le pont du _Rangoon_. Le brave gar�on
avait achet� quelques douzaines de mangoustes, grosses comme des
pommes moyennes, d'un brun fonc� au-dehors, d'un rouge �clatant
au-dedans, et dont le fruit blanc, en fondant entre les l�vres,
procure aux vrais gourmets une jouissance sans pareille. Passepartout
fut trop heureux de les offrir � Mrs. Aouda, qui le remercia avec
beaucoup de gr�ce.

A onze heures, le _Rangoon_, ayant son plein de charbon, larguait ses
amarres, et, quelques heures plus tard, les passagers perdaient de vue
ces hautes montagnes de Malacca, dont les for�ts abritent les plus
beaux tigres de la terre.

Treize cents milles environ s�parent Singapore de l'�le de Hong-Kong,
petit territoire anglais d�tach� de la c�te chinoise. Phileas Fogg
avait int�r�t � les franchir en six jours au plus, afin de prendre �
Hong-Kong le bateau qui devait partir le 6 novembre pour Yokohama,
l'un des principaux ports du Japon.

Le _Rangoon_ �tait fort charg�. De nombreux passagers s'�taient
embarqu�s � Singapore, des Indous, des Ceylandais, des Chinois, des
Malais, des Portugais, qui, pour la plupart, occupaient les secondes
places.

Le temps, assez beau jusqu'alors, changea avec le dernier quartier de
la lune. Il y eut grosse mer. Le vent souffla quelquefois en grande
brise, mais tr�s heureusement de la partie du sud-est, ce qui
favorisait la marche du steamer. Quand il �tait maniable, le
capitaine faisait �tablir la voilure. Le _Rangoon_, gr�� en brick,
navigua souvent avec ses deux huniers et sa misaine, et sa rapidit�
s'accrut sous la double action de la vapeur et du vent. C'est ainsi
que l'on prolongea, sur une lame courte et parfois tr�s fatigante, les
c�tes d'Annam et de Cochinchine.

Mais la faute en �tait plut�t au _Rangoon_ qu'� la mer, et c'est � ce
paquebot que les passagers, dont la plupart furent malades, durent
s'en prendre de cette fatigue.

En effet, les navires de la Compagnie p�ninsulaire, qui font le
service des mers de Chine, ont un s�rieux d�faut de construction. Le
rapport de leur tirant d'eau en charge avec leur creux a �t� mal
calcul�, et, par suite, ils n'offrent qu'une faible r�sistance � la
mer. Leur volume, clos, imp�n�trable � l'eau, est insuffisant. Ils
sont � noy�s �, pour employer l'expression maritime, et, en
cons�quence de cette disposition, il ne faut que quelques paquets de
mer, jet�s � bord, pour modifier leur allure. Ces navires sont donc
tr�s inf�rieurs -- sinon par le moteur et l'appareil �vaporatoire, du
moins par la construction, -- aux types des Messageries fran�aises,
tels que l'_Imp�ratrice_ et le _Cambodge_. Tandis que, suivant les
calculs des ing�nieurs, ceux-ci peuvent embarquer un poids d'eau �gal
� leur propre poids avant de sombrer, les bateaux de la Compagnie
p�ninsulaire, le _Golgonda_, le _Corea_, et enfin le _Rangoon_, ne
pourraient pas embarquer le sixi�me de leur poids sans couler par le
fond.

Donc, par le mauvais temps, il convenait de prendre de grandes
pr�cautions. Il fallait quelquefois mettre � la cape sous petite
vapeur. C'�tait une perte de temps qui ne paraissait affecter Phileas
Fogg en aucune fa�on, mais dont Passepartout se montrait extr�mement
irrit�. Il accusait alors le capitaine, le m�canicien, la Compagnie,
et envoyait au diable tous ceux qui se m�lent de transporter des
voyageurs. Peut-�tre aussi la pens�e de ce bec de gaz qui continuait
de br�ler � son compte dans la maison de Saville-row entrait-elle pour
beaucoup dans son impatience.

� Mais vous �tes donc bien press� d'arriver � Hong-Kong ? lui demanda
un jour le d�tective.

-- Tr�s press�! r�pondit Passepartout.

-- Vous pensez que Mr. Fogg a h�te de prendre le paquebot de
Yokohama ?

-- Une h�te effroyable.

-- Vous croyez donc maintenant � ce singulier voyage autour du monde ?

-- Absolument. Et vous, monsieur Fix ?

-- Moi ? je n'y crois pas !

-- Farceur ! � r�pondit Passepartout en clignant de l'oeil.

Ce mot laissa l'agent r�veur. Ce qualificatif l'inqui�ta, sans qu'il
s�t trop pourquoi. Le Fran�ais l'avait-il devin� ? Il ne savait trop
que penser. Mais sa qualit� de d�tective, dont seul il avait le
secret, comment Passepartout aurait-il pu la reconna�tre ? Et
cependant, en lui parlant ainsi, Passepartout avait certainement eu
une arri�re-pens�e.

Il arriva m�me que le brave gar�on alla plus loin, un autre jour, mais
c'�tait plus fort que lui. Il ne pouvait tenir sa langue.

� Voyons, monsieur Fix, demanda-t-il � son compagnon d'un ton
malicieux, est-ce que, une fois arriv�s � Hong-Kong, nous aurons le
malheur de vous y laisser ?

-- Mais, r�pondit Fix assez embarrass�, je ne sais !... Peut-�tre
que...

-- Ah ! dit Passepartout, si vous nous accompagniez, ce serait un
bonheur pour moi ! Voyons ! un agent de la Compagnie p�ninsulaire ne
saurait s'arr�ter en route ! Vous n'alliez qu'� Bombay, et vous voici
bient�t en Chine ! L'Am�rique n'est pas loin, et de l'Am�rique �
l'Europe il n'y a qu'un pas ! �

Fix regardait attentivement son interlocuteur, qui lui montrait la
figure la plus aimable du monde, et il prit le parti de rire avec lui.
Mais celui-ci, qui �tait en veine, lui demanda si � �a lui rapportait
beaucoup, ce m�tier-l� ? �

� Oui et non, r�pondit Fix sans sourciller. Il y a de bonnes et de
mauvaises affaires. Mais vous comprenez bien que je ne voyage pas �
mes frais !

-- Oh ! pour cela, j'en suis s�r ! � s'�cria Passepartout, riant de
plus belle.

La conversation finie, Fix rentra dans sa cabine et se mit �
r�fl�chir. Il �tait �videmment devin�. D'une fa�on ou d'une autre,
le Fran�ais avait reconnu sa qualit� de d�tective. Mais avait-il
pr�venu son ma�tre ? Quel r�le jouait-il dans tout ceci ? �tait-il
complice ou non ? L'affaire �tait-elle �vent�e, et par cons�quent
manqu�e ? L'agent passa l� quelques heures difficiles, tant�t croyant
tout perdu, tant�t esp�rant que Fogg ignorait la situation, enfin ne
sachant quel parti prendre.

Cependant le calme se r�tablit dans son cerveau, et il r�solut d'agir
franchement avec Passepartout. S'il ne se trouvait pas dans les
conditions voulues pour arr�ter Fogg � Hong-Kong, et si Fogg se
pr�parait � quitter d�finitivement cette fois le territoire anglais,
lui, Fix, dirait tout � Passepartout. Ou le domestique �tait le
complice de son ma�tre -- et celui-ci savait tout, et dans ce cas
l'affaire �tait d�finitivement compromise -- ou le domestique n'�tait
pour rien dans le vol, et alors son int�r�t serait d'abandonner le
voleur.

Telle �tait donc la situation respective de ces deux hommes, et
au-dessus d'eux Phileas Fogg planait dans sa majestueuse indiff�rence.
Il accomplissait rationnellement son orbite autour du monde, sans
s'inqui�ter des ast�ro�des qui gravitaient autour de lui.

Et cependant, dans le voisinage, il y avait -- suivant l'expression
des astronomes -- un astre troublant qui aurait d� produire certaines
perturbations sur le coeur de ce gentleman. Mais non ! Le charme de
Mrs. Aouda n'agissait point, � la grande surprise de Passepartout, et
les perturbations, si elles existaient, eussent �t� plus difficiles �
calculer que celles d'Uranus qui l'ont amen� la d�couverte de Neptune.

Oui ! c'�tait un �tonnement de tous les jours pour Passepartout, qui
lisait tant de reconnaissance envers son ma�tre dans les yeux de la
jeune femme ! D�cid�ment Phileas Fogg n'avait de coeur que ce qu'il
en fallait pour se conduire h�ro�quement, mais amoureusement, non !
Quant aux pr�occupations que les chances de ce voyage pouvaient faire
na�tre en lui, il n'y en avait pas trace. Mais Passepartout, lui,
vivait dans des transes continuelles. Un jour, appuy� sur la rambarde
de l'� engine-room �, il regardait la puissante machine qui
s'emportait parfois, quand dans un violent mouvement de tangage,
l'h�lice s'affolait hors des flots. La vapeur fusait alors par les
soupapes, ce qui provoqua la col�re du digne gar�on.

� Elles ne sont pas assez charg�es, ces soupapes ! s'�cria-t-il. On
ne marche pas ! Voil� bien ces Anglais ! Ah ! si c'�tait un navire
am�ricain, on sauterait peut-�tre, mais on irait plus vite ! �

                                XVIII
                         --------------------
             DANS LEQUEL PHILEAS FOGG, PASSEPARTOUT, FIX,
                CHACUN DE SON C�T�, VA A SES AFFAIRES

Pendant les derniers jours de la travers�e, le temps fut assez
mauvais. Le vent devint tr�s fort. Fix� dans la partie du
nord-ouest, il contraria la marche du paquebot. Le _Rangoon_, trop
instable, roula consid�rablement, et les passagers furent en droit de
garder rancune � ces longues lames affadissantes que le vent soulevait
du large.

Pendant les journ�es du 3 et du 4 novembre, ce fut une sorte de
temp�te. La bourrasque battit la mer avec v�h�mence. Le _Rangoon_
dut mettre � la cape pendant un demi-jour, se maintenant avec dix
tours d'h�lice seulement, de mani�re � biaiser avec les lames. Toutes
les voiles avaient �t� serr�es, et c'�tait encore trop de ces agr�s
qui sifflaient au milieu des rafales.

La vitesse du paquebot, on le con�oit, fut notablement diminu�e, et
l'on put estimer qu'il arriverait � Hong-Kong avec vingt heures de
retard sur l'heure r�glementaire, et plus m�me, si la temp�te ne
cessait pas.

Phileas Fogg assistait � ce spectacle d'une mer furieuse, qui semblait
lutter directement contre lui, avec son habituelle impassibilit�. Son
front ne s'assombrit pas un instant, et, cependant, un retard de vingt
heures pouvait compromettre son voyage en lui faisant manquer le
d�part du paquebot de Yokohama. Mais cet homme sans nerfs ne
ressentait ni impatience ni ennui. Il semblait vraiment que cette
temp�te rentr�t dans son programme, qu'elle f�t pr�vue. Mrs. Aouda,
qui s'entretint avec son compagnon de ce contretemps, le trouva aussi
calme que par le pass�.

Fix, lui, ne voyait pas ces choses du m�me oeil. Bien au contraire.
Cette temp�te lui plaisait. Sa satisfaction aurait m�me �t� sans
bornes, si le _Rangoon_ e�t �t� oblig� de fuir devant la tourmente.
Tous ces retards lui allaient, car ils obligeraient le sieur Fogg �
rester quelques jours � Hong-Kong. Enfin, le ciel, avec ses rafales
et ses bourrasques, entrait dans son jeu. Il �tait bien un peu
malade, mais qu'importe ! Il ne comptait pas ses naus�es, et, quand
son corps se tordait sous le mal de mer, son esprit s'�baudissait
d'une immense satisfaction.

Quant � Passepartout, on devine dans quelle col�re peu dissimul�e il
passa ce temps d'�preuve. Jusqu'alors tout avait si bien march� ! La
terre et l'eau semblaient �tre � la d�votion de son ma�tre. Steamers
et railways lui ob�issaient. Le vent et la vapeur s'unissaient pour
favoriser son voyage. L'heure des m�comptes avait-elle donc enfin
sonn� ? Passepartout, comme si les vingt mille livres du pari eussent
d� sortir de sa bourse, ne vivait plus. Cette temp�te l'exasp�rait,
cette rafale le mettait en fureur, et il e�t volontiers fouett� cette
mer d�sob�issante ! Pauvre gar�on ! Fix lui cacha soigneusement sa
satisfaction personnelle, et il fit bien, car si Passepartout e�t
devin� le secret contentement de Fix, Fix e�t pass� un mauvais quart
d'heure.

Passepartout, pendant toute la dur�e de la bourrasque, demeura sur le
pont du _Rangoon_. Il n'aurait pu rester en bas ; il grimpait dans la
m�ture ; il �tonnait l'�quipage et aidait � tout avec une adresse de
singe. Cent fois il interrogea le capitaine, les officiers, les
matelots, qui ne pouvaient s'emp�cher de rire en voyant un gar�on si
d�contenanc�. Passepartout voulait absolument savoir combien de temps
durerait la temp�te. On le renvoyait alors au barom�tre, qui ne se
d�cidait pas � remonter. Passepartout secouait le barom�tre, mais
rien n'y faisait, ni les secousses, ni les injures dont il accablait
l'irresponsable instrument.

Enfin la tourmente s'apaisa. L'�tat de la mer se modifia dans la
journ�e du 4 novembre. Le vent sauta de deux quarts dans le sud et
redevint favorable.

Passepartout se rass�r�na avec le temps. Les huniers et les basses
voiles purent �tre �tablis, et le _Rangoon_ reprit sa route avec une
merveilleuse vitesse.

Mais on ne pouvait regagner tout le temps perdu. Il fallait bien en
prendre son parti, et la terre ne fut signal�e que le 6, � cinq heures
du matin. L'itin�raire de Phileas Fogg portait l'arriv�e du paquebot
au 5. Or, il n'arrivait que le 6. C'�tait donc vingt-quatre heures
de retard, et le d�part pour Yokohama serait n�cessairement manqu�.

A six heures, le pilote monta � bord du _Rangoon_ et prit place sur la
passerelle, afin de diriger le navire � travers les passes jusqu'au
port de Hong-Kong.

Passepartout mourait du d�sir d'interroger cet homme, de lui demander
si le paquebot de Yokohama avait quitt� Hong-Kong. Mais il n'osait
pas, aimant mieux conserver un peu d'espoir jusqu'au dernier instant.
Il avait confi� ses inqui�tudes � Fix, qui -- le fin renard --
essayait de le consoler, en lui disant que Mr. Fogg en serait quitte
pour prendre le prochain paquebot. Ce qui mettait Passepartout dans
une col�re bleue.

Mais si Passepartout ne se hasarda pas � interroger le pilote, Mr.
Fogg, apr�s avoir consult� son Bradshaw, demanda de son air tranquille
audit pilote s'il savait quand il partirait un bateau de Hong-Kong
pour Yokohama.

� Demain, � la mar�e du matin, r�pondit le pilote.

-- Ah ! � fit Mr. Fogg, sans manifester aucun �tonnement.

Passepartout, qui �tait pr�sent, e�t volontiers embrass� le pilote,
auquel Fix aurait voulu tordre le cou.

� Quel est le nom de ce steamer ? demanda Mr. Fogg.

-- Le _Carnatic_, r�pondit le pilote.

-- N'�tait-ce pas hier qu'il devait partir ?

-- Oui, monsieur, mais on a d� r�parer une de ses chaudi�res, et son
d�part a �t� remis � demain.

-- Je vous remercie �, r�pondit Mr. Fogg, qui de son pas automatique
redescendit dans le salon du _Rangoon_.

Quant � Passepartout, il saisit la main du pilote et l'�treignit
vigoureusement en disant :

� Vous, pilote, vous �tes un brave homme ! �

Le pilote ne sut jamais, sans doute, pourquoi ses r�ponses lui
valurent cette amicale expansion. A un coup de sifflet, il remonta
sur la passerelle et dirigea le paquebot au milieu de cette flottille
de jonques, de tankas, de bateaux-p�cheurs, de navires de toutes
sortes, qui encombraient les pertuis de Hong-Kong.

A une heure, le _Rangoon_ �tait � quai, et les passagers d�barquaient.

En cette circonstance, le hasard avait singuli�rement servi Phileas
Fogg, il faut en convenir. Sans cette n�cessit� de r�parer ses
chaudi�res, le _Carnatic_ f�t parti � la date du 5 novembre, et les
voyageurs pour le Japon auraient d� attendre pendant huit jours le
d�part du paquebot suivant. Mr. Fogg, il est vrai, �tait en retard
de vingt-quatre heures, mais ce retard ne pouvait avoir de
cons�quences f�cheuses pour le reste du voyage.

En effet, le steamer qui fait de Yokohama � San Francisco la travers�e
du Pacifique �tait en correspondance directe avec le paquebot de
Hong-Kong, et il ne pouvait partir avant que celui-ci f�t arriv�.
�videmment il y aurait vingt-quatre heures de retard � Yokohama, mais,
pendant les vingt-deux jours que dure la travers�e du Pacifique, il
serait facile de les regagner. Phileas Fogg se trouvait donc, �
vingt-quatre heures pr�s, dans les conditions de son programme,
trente-cinq jours apr�s avoir quitt� Londres.

Le _Carnatic_ ne devant partir que le lendemain matin � cinq heures,
Mr. Fogg avait devant lui seize heures pour s'occuper de ses
affaires, c'est-�-dire de celles qui concernaient Mrs. Aouda. Au
d�barqu� du bateau, il offrit son bras � la jeune femme et la
conduisit vers un palanquin. Il demanda aux porteurs de lui indiquer
un h�tel, et ceux-ci lui d�sign�rent l'_H�tel du Club_. Le palanquin
se mit en route, suivi de Passepartout, et vingt minutes apr�s il
arrivait � destination.

Un appartement fut retenu pour la jeune femme et Phileas Fogg veilla �
ce qu'elle ne manqu�t de rien. Puis il dit � Mrs. Aouda qu'il allait
imm�diatement se mettre � la recherche de ce parent aux soins duquel
il devait la laisser � Hong-Kong. En m�me temps il donnait �
Passepartout l'ordre de demeurer � l'h�tel jusqu'� son retour, afin
que la jeune femme n'y rest�t pas seule.

Le gentleman se fit conduire � la Bourse. L�, on conna�trait
immanquablement un personnage tel que l'honorable Jejeeh, qui comptait
parmi les plus riches commer�ants de la ville.

Le courtier auquel s'adressa Mr. Fogg connaissait en effet le
n�gociant parsi. Mais, depuis deux ans, celui-ci n'habitait plus la
Chine. Sa fortune faite, il s'�tait �tabli en Europe -- en Hollande,
croyait-on --, ce qui s'expliquait par suite de nombreuses relations
qu'il avait eues avec ce pays pendant son existence commerciale.

Phileas Fogg revint � l'_H�tel du Club_. Aussit�t il fit demander �
Mrs. Aouda la permission de se pr�senter devant elle, et, sans autre
pr�ambule, il lui apprit que l'honorable Jejeeh ne r�sidait plus �
Hong-Kong, et qu'il habitait vraisemblablement la Hollande.

A cela, Mrs. Aouda ne r�pondit rien d'abord. Elle passa sa main sur
son front, et resta quelques instants � r�fl�chir. Puis, de sa douce
voix :

� Que dois-je faire, monsieur Fogg ? dit-elle.

-- C'est tr�s simple, r�pondit le gentleman. Revenir en Europe.

-- Mais je ne puis abuser...

-- Vous n'abusez pas, et votre pr�sence ne g�ne en rien mon
programme... Passepartout ?

-- Monsieur ? r�pondit Passepartout.

-- Allez au _Carnatic_, et retenez trois cabines. �

Passepartout, enchant� de continuer son voyage dans la compagnie de la
jeune femme, qui �tait fort gracieuse pour lui, quitta aussit�t
l'_H�tel du Club_.

                                 XIX
                         --------------------
              O� PASSEPARTOUT PREND UN TROP VIF INT�R�T
                   A SON MA�TRE, ET CE QUI S'ENSUIT

Hong-Kong n'est qu'un �lot, dont le trait� de Nanking, apr�s la guerre
de 1842, assura la possession � l'Angleterre. En quelques ann�es, le
g�nie colonisateur de la Grande-Bretagne y avait fond� une ville
importante et cr�� un port, le port Victoria. Cette �le est situ�e �
l'embouchure de la rivi�re de Canton, et soixante milles seulement la
s�parent de la cit� portugaise de Macao, b�tie sur l'autre rive.
Hong-Kong devait n�cessairement vaincre Macao dans une lutte
commerciale, et maintenant la plus grande partie du transit chinois
s'op�re par la ville anglaise. Des docks, des h�pitaux, des wharfs,
des entrep�ts, une cath�drale gothique, un � government-house �, des
rues macadamis�es, tout ferait croire qu'une des cit�s commer�antes
des comt�s de Kent ou de Surrey, traversant le sph�ro�de terrestre,
est venue ressortir en ce point de la Chine, presque � ses antipodes.

Passepartout, les mains dans les poches, se rendit donc vers le port
Victoria, regardant les palanquins, les brouettes � voile, encore en
faveur dans le C�leste Empire, et toute cette foule de Chinois, de
Japonais et d'Europ�ens, qui se pressait dans les rues. A peu de
choses pr�s, c'�tait encore Bombay, Calcutta ou Singapore, que le
digne gar�on retrouvait sur son parcours. Il y a ainsi comme une
tra�n�e de villes anglaises tout autour du monde.

Passepartout arriva au port Victoria. L�, � l'embouchure de la
rivi�re de Canton, c'�tait un fourmillement de navires de toutes
nations, des anglais, des fran�ais, des am�ricains, des hollandais,
b�timents de guerre et de commerce, des embarcations japonaises ou
chinoises, des jonques, des sempans, des tankas, et m�me des
bateaux-fleurs qui formaient autant de parterres flottants sur les
eaux. En se promenant, Passepartout remarqua un certain nombre
d'indig�nes v�tus de jaune, tous tr�s avanc�s en �ge. �tant entr�
chez un barbier chinois pour se faire raser � � la chinoise �, il
apprit par le Figaro de l'endroit, qui parlait un assez bon anglais,
que ces vieillards avaient tous quatre-vingts ans au moins, et qu'�
cet �ge ils avaient le privil�ge de porter la couleur jaune, qui est
la couleur imp�riale. Passepartout trouva cela fort dr�le, sans trop
savoir pourquoi.

Sa barbe faite, il se rendit au quai d'embarquement du _Carnatic_, et
l� il aper�ut Fix qui se promenait de long en large, ce dont il ne fut
point �tonn�. Mais l'inspecteur de police laissait voir sur son
visage les marques d'un vif d�sappointement.

� Bon ! se dit Passepartout, cela va mal pour les gentlemen du
Reform-Club ! �

Et il accosta Fix avec son joyeux sourire, sans vouloir remarquer
l'air vex� de son compagnon.

Or, l'agent avait de bonnes raisons pour pester contre l'infernale
chance qui le poursuivait. Pas de mandat ! Il �tait �vident que le
mandat courait apr�s lui, et ne pourrait l'atteindre que s'il
s�journait quelques jours en cette ville. Or, Hong-Kong �tant la
derni�re terre anglaise du parcours, le sieur Fogg allait lui �chapper
d�finitivement, s'il ne parvenait pas � l'y retenir.

� Eh bien, monsieur Fix, �tes-vous d�cid� � venir avec nous jusqu'en
Am�rique ? demanda Passepartout.

-- Oui, r�pondit Fix les dents serr�es.

-- Allons donc ! s'�cria Passepartout en faisant entendre un
retentissant �clat de rire ! Je savais bien que vous ne pourriez pas
vous s�parer de nous. Venez retenir votre place, venez ! �

Et tous deux entr�rent au bureau des transports maritimes et
arr�t�rent des cabines pour quatre personnes. Mais l'employ� leur fit
observer que les r�parations du _Carnatic_ �tant termin�es, le
paquebot partirait le soir m�me � huit heures, et non le lendemain
matin, comme il avait �t� annonc�.

� Tr�s bien ! r�pondit Passepartout, cela arrangera mon ma�tre. Je
vais le pr�venir. �

A ce moment, Fix prit un parti extr�me. Il r�solut de tout dire �
Passepartout. C'�tait le seul moyen peut-�tre qu'il e�t de retenir
Phileas Fogg pendant quelques jours � Hong-Kong.

En quittant le bureau, Fix offrit � son compagnon de se rafra�chir
dans une taverne. Passepartout avait le temps. Il accepta
l'invitation de Fix.

Une taverne s'ouvrait sur le quai. Elle avait un aspect engageant.
Tous deux y entr�rent. C'�tait une vaste salle bien d�cor�e, au fond
de laquelle s'�tendait un lit de camp, garni de coussins. Sur ce lit
�taient rang�s un certain nombre de dormeurs.

Une trentaine de consommateurs occupaient dans la grande salle de
petites tables en jonc tress�. Quelques uns vidaient des pintes de
bi�re anglaise, ale ou porter, d'autres, des brocs de liqueurs
alcooliques, gin ou brandy. En outre, la plupart fumaient de longues
pipes de terre rouge, bourr�es de petites boulettes d'opium m�lang�
d'essence de rose. Puis, de temps en temps, quelque fumeur �nerv�
glissait sous la table, et les gar�ons de l'�tablissement, le prenant
par les pieds et par la t�te, le portaient sur le lit de camp pr�s
d'un confr�re. Une vingtaine de ces ivrognes �taient ainsi rang�s
c�te � c�te, dans le dernier degr� d'abrutissement.

Fix et Passepartout comprirent qu'ils �taient entr�s dans une tabagie
hant�e de ces mis�rables, h�b�t�s, amaigris, idiots, auxquels la
mercantile Angleterre vend annuellement pour deux cent soixante
millions de francs de cette funeste drogue qui s'appelle l'opium !
Tristes millions que ceux-l�, pr�lev�s sur un des plus funestes vices
de la nature humaine.

Le gouvernement chinois a bien essay� de rem�dier � un tel abus par
des lois s�v�res, mais en vain. De la classe riche, � laquelle
l'usage de l'opium �tait d'abord formellement r�serv�, cet usage
descendit jusqu'aux classes inf�rieures, et les ravages ne purent plus
�tre arr�t�s. On fume l'opium partout et toujours dans l'empire du
Milieu. Hommes et femmes s'adonnent � cette passion d�plorable, et
lorsqu'ils sont accoutum�s � cette inhalation, ils ne peuvent plus
s'en passer, � moins d'�prouver d'horribles contractions de l'estomac.
Un grand fumeur peut fumer jusqu'� huit pipes par jour mais il meurt
en cinq ans.

Or, c'�tait dans une des nombreuses tabagies de ce genre, qui
pullulent, m�me � Hong-Kong, que Fix et Passepartout �taient entr�s
avec l'intention de se rafra�chir. Passepartout n'avait pas d'argent,
mais il accepta volontiers la � politesse � de son compagnon, quitte �
la lui rendre en temps et lieu.

On demanda deux bouteilles de porto, auxquelles le Fran�ais fit
largement honneur, tandis que Fix, plus r�serv�, observait son
compagnon avec une extr�me attention. On causa de choses et d'autres,
et surtout de cette excellente id�e qu'avait eue Fix de prendre
passage sur le _Carnatic_. Et � propos de ce steamer, dont le d�part
se trouvait avanc� de quelques heures, Passepartout, les bouteilles
�tant vides, se leva, afin d'aller pr�venir son ma�tre.

Fix le retint.

� Un instant, dit-il.

-- Que voulez-vous, monsieur Fix ?

-- J'ai � vous parler de choses s�rieuses.

-- De choses s�rieuses ! s'�cria Passepartout en vidant quelques
gouttes de vin rest�es au fond au son verre. Eh bien, nous en
parlerons demain. Je n'ai pas le temps aujourd'hui.

-- Restez, r�pondit Fix. Il s'agit de votre ma�tre ! �

Passepartout, � ce mot, regarda attentivement son interlocuteur.

L'expression du visage de Fix lui parut singuli�re. Il se rassit.

� Qu'est-ce donc que vous avez � me dire � demanda-t-il.

Fix appuya sa main sur le bras de son compagnon et, baissant la voix :

� Vous avez devin� qui j'�tais ? lui demanda-t-il.

-- Parbleu ! dit Passepartout en souriant.

-- Alors je vais tout vous avouer...

-- Maintenant que je sais tout, mon comp�re ! Ah ! voil� qui n'est
pas fort ! Enfin, allez toujours. Mais auparavant, laissez-moi vous
dire que ces gentlemen se sont mis en frais bien inutilement !

-- Inutilement ! dit Fix. Vous en parlez � votre aise ! On voit
bien que vous ne connaissez pas l'importance de la somme !

-- Mais si, je la connais, r�pondit Passepartout. Vingt mille
livres !

-- Cinquante-cinq mille ! reprit Fix, en serrant la main du Fran�ais.

-- Quoi ! s'�cria Passepartout, Mr. Fogg aurait os� !...
Cinquante-cinq mille livres !... Eh bien ! raison de plus pour ne
pas perdre un instant, ajouta-t-il en se levant de nouveau.

-- Cinquante-cinq mille livres ! reprit Fix, qui for�a Passepartout �
se rasseoir, apr�s avoir fait apporter un flacon de brandy, -- et si
je r�ussis, je gagne une prime de deux mille livres. En voulez-vous
cinq cents (12 500 F) � la condition de m'aider ?

-- Vous aider ? s'�cria Passepartout, dont les yeux �taient
d�mesur�ment ouverts.

-- Oui, m'aider � retenir le sieur Fogg pendant quelques jours �
Hong-Kong !

-- Hein ! fit Passepartout, que dites-vous l� ? Comment ! non
content de faire suivre mon ma�tre, de suspecter sa loyaut�, ces
gentlemen veulent encore lui susciter des obstacles ! J'en suis
honteux pour eux !

-- Ah �� ! que voulez-vous dire ? demanda Fix.

-- Je veux dire que c'est de la pure ind�licatesse. Autant d�pouiller
Mr. Fogg, et lui prendre l'argent dans la poche !

-- Eh ! c'est bien � cela que nous comptons arriver !

-- Mais c'est un guet-apens ! s'�cria Passepartout, -- qui s'animait
alors sous l'influence du brandy que lui servait Fix, et qu'il buvait
sans s'en apercevoir, -- un guet-apens v�ritable ! Des gentlemen !
des coll�gues ! �

Fix commen�ait � ne plus comprendre.

� Des coll�gues ! s'�cria Passepartout, des membres du Reform-Club !
Sachez, monsieur Fix, que mon ma�tre est un honn�te homme, et que,
quand il a fait un pari, c'est loyalement qu'il pr�tend le gagner.

-- Mais qui croyez-vous donc que je sois ? demanda Fix, en fixant son
regard sur Passepartout.

-- Parbleu ! un agent des membres du Reform-Club, qui a mission de
contr�ler l'itin�raire de mon ma�tre, ce qui est singuli�rement
humiliant ! Aussi, bien que, depuis quelque temps d�j�, j'aie devin�
votre qualit�, je me suis bien gard� de la r�v�ler � Mr. Fogg !

-- Il ne sait rien ?... demanda vivement Fix.

-- Rien �, r�pondit Passepartout en vidant encore une fois son verre.

L'inspecteur de police passa sa main sur son front. Il h�sitait avant
de reprendre la parole. Que devait-il faire ? L'erreur de
Passepartout semblait sinc�re, mais elle rendait son projet plus
difficile. Il �tait �vident que ce gar�on parlait avec une absolue
bonne foi, et qu'il n'�tait point le complice de son ma�tre, -- ce que
Fix aurait pu craindre.

� Eh bien, se dit-il, puisqu'il n'est pas son complice, il m'aidera. �

Le d�tective avait une seconde fois pris son parti. D'ailleurs, il
n'avait plus le temps d'attendre. A tout prix, il fallait arr�ter
Fogg � Hong-Kong.

� Ecoutez, dit Fix d'une voix br�ve, �coutez-moi bien. Je ne suis pas
ce que vous croyez, c'est-�-dire un agent des membres du
Reform-Club...

-- Bah ! dit Passepartout en le regardant d'un air goguenard.

-- Je suis un inspecteur de police, charg� d'une mission par
l'administration m�tropolitaine...

-- Vous... inspecteur de police !...

-- Oui, et je le prouve, reprit Fix. Voici ma commission. �

Et l'agent, tirant un papier de son portefeuille, montra � son
compagnon une commission sign�e du directeur de la police centrale.
Passepartout, abasourdi, regardait Fix, sans pouvoir articuler une
parole.

� Le pari du sieur Fogg, reprit Fix, n'est qu'un pr�texte dont vous
�tes dupes, vous et ses coll�gues du Reform-Club, car il avait int�r�t
� s'assurer votre inconsciente complicit�.

-- Mais pourquoi ?... s'�cria Passepartout.

-- Ecoutez. Le 28 septembre dernier, un vol de cinquante-cinq mille
livres a �t� commis � la Banque d'Angleterre par un individu dont le
signalement a pu �tre relev�. Or, voici ce signalement, et c'est
trait pour trait celui du sieur Fogg.

-- Allons donc ! s'�cria Passepartout en frappant la table de son
robuste poing. Mon ma�tre est le plus honn�te homme du monde !

-- Qu'en savez-vous ? r�pondit Fix. Vous ne le connaissez m�me pas !
Vous �tes entr� � son service le jour de son d�part, et il est parti
pr�cipitamment sous un pr�texte insens�, sans malles, emportant une
grosse somme en bank-notes ! Et vous osez soutenir que c'est un
honn�te homme !

-- Oui ! oui ! r�p�tait machinalement le pauvre gar�on.

-- Voulez-vous donc �tre arr�t� comme son complice ? �

Passepartout avait pris sa t�te � deux mains. Il n'�tait plus
reconnaissable. Il n'osait regarder l'inspecteur de police. Phileas
Fogg un voleur, lui, le sauveur d'Aouda, l'homme g�n�reux et brave !
Et pourtant que de pr�somptions relev�es contre lui ! Passepartout
essayait de repousser les soup�ons qui se glissaient dans son esprit.
Il ne voulait pas croire � la culpabilit� de son ma�tre.

� Enfin, que voulez-vous de moi ? dit-il � l'agent de police, en se
contenant par un supr�me effort.

-- Voici, r�pondit Fix. J'ai fil� le sieur Fogg jusqu'ici, mais je
n'ai pas encore re�u le mandat d'arrestation, que j'ai demand� �
Londres. Il faut donc que vous m'aidiez � retenir � Hong-Kong...

-- Moi ! que je...

-- Et je partage avec vous la prime de deux mille livres promise par
la Banque d'Angleterre !

-- Jamais ! � r�pondit Passepartout, qui voulut se lever et retomba,
sentant sa raison et ses forces lui �chapper � la fois.

� Monsieur Fix, dit-il en balbutiant, quand bien m�me tout ce que vous
m'avez dit serait vrai... quand mon ma�tre serait le voleur que vous
cherchez... ce que je nie... j'ai �t�... je suis � son service...
je l'ai vu bon et g�n�reux... Le trahir... jamais... non, pour tout
l'or du monde... Je suis d'un village o� l'on ne mange pas de ce
pain-l�!...

-- Vous refusez ?

-- Je refuse.

-- Mettons que je n'ai rien dit, r�pondit Fix, et buvons.

-- Oui, buvons ! �

Passepartout se sentait de plus en plus envahir par l'ivresse. Fix,
comprenant qu'il fallait � tout prix le s�parer de son ma�tre, voulut
l'achever. Sur la table se trouvaient quelques pipes charg�es
d'opium. Fix en glissa une dans la main de Passepartout, qui la prit,
la porta � ses l�vres, l'alluma, respira quelques bouff�es, et
retomba, la t�te alourdie sous l'influence du narcotique.

� Enfin, dit Fix en voyant Passepartout an�anti, le sieur Fogg ne sera
pas pr�venu � temps du d�part du _Carnatic_, et s'il part, du moins
partira-t-il sans ce maudit Fran�ais ! �

Puis il sortit, apr�s avoir pay� la d�pense.

                         --------------------
            DANS LEQUEL FIX ENTRE DIRECTEMENT EN RELATION
                          AVEC PHILEAS FOGG

Pendant cette sc�ne qui allait peut-�tre compromettre si gravement son
avenir, Mr. Fogg, accompagnant Mrs. Aouda, se promenait dans les
rues de la ville anglaise. Depuis que Mrs. Aouda avait accept� son
offre de la conduire jusqu'en Europe, il avait d� songer � tous les
d�tails que comporte un aussi long voyage. Qu'un Anglais comme lui
f�t le tour du monde un sac � la main, passe encore ; mais une femme
ne pouvait entreprendre une pareille travers�e dans ces conditions.
De l�, n�cessit� d'acheter les v�tements et objets n�cessaires au
voyage. Mr. Fogg s'acquitta de sa t�che avec le calme qui le
caract�risait, et � toutes les excuses ou objections de la jeune
veuve, confuse de tant de complaisance :

� C'est dans l'int�r�t de mon voyage, c'est dans mon programme �,
r�pondait-il invariablement.

Les acquisitions faites, Mr. Fogg et la jeune femme rentr�rent �
l'h�tel et d�n�rent � la table d'h�te, qui �tait somptueusement
servie. Puis Mrs. Aouda, un peu fatigu�e, remonta dans son
appartement, apr�s avoir � � l'anglaise � serr� la main de son
imperturbable sauveur.

L'honorable gentleman, lui, s'absorba pendant toute la soir�e dans la
lecture du _Times_ et de l'_Illustrated London News_.

S'il avait �t� homme � s'�tonner de quelque chose, c'e�t �t� de ne
point voir appara�tre son domestique � l'heure du coucher. Mais,
sachant que le paquebot de Yokohama ne devait pas quitter Hong-Kong
avant le lendemain matin, il ne s'en pr�occupa pas autrement. Le
lendemain, Passepartout ne vint point au coup de sonnette de Mr.
Fogg.

Ce que pensa l'honorable gentleman en apprenant que son domestique
n'�tait pas rentr� � l'h�tel nul n'aurait pu le dire. Mr. Fogg se
contenta de prendre son sac, fit pr�venir Mrs. Aouda, et envoya
chercher un palanquin.

Il �tait alors huit heures, et la pleine mer, dont le _Carnatic_
devait profiter pour sortir des passes, �tait indiqu�e pour neuf
heures et demie.

Lorsque le palanquin fut arriv� � la porte de l'h�tel, Mr. Fogg et
Mrs. Aouda mont�rent dans ce confortable v�hicule, et les bagages
suivirent derri�re sur une brouette.

Une demi-heure plus tard, les voyageurs descendaient sur le quai
d'embarquement, et l� Mr. Fogg apprenait que le _Carnatic_ �tait
parti depuis la veille.

Mr. Fogg, qui comptait trouver, � la fois, et le paquebot et son
domestique, en �tait r�duit � se passer de l'un et de l'autre. Mais
aucune marque de d�sappointement ne parut sur son visage, et comme
Mrs. Aouda le regardait avec inqui�tude, il se contenta de r�pondre :

� C'est un incident, madame, rien de plus. �

En ce moment, un personnage qui l'observait avec attention s'approcha
de lui. C'�tait l'inspecteur Fix, qui le salua et lui dit :

� N'�tes-vous pas comme moi, monsieur, un des passagers du _Rangoon_,
arriv� hier ?

-- Oui, monsieur, r�pondit froidement Mr. Fogg, mais je n'ai pas
l'honneur...

-- Pardonnez-moi, mais je croyais trouver ici votre domestique.

-- Savez-vous o� il est, monsieur ? demanda vivement la jeune femme.

-- Quoi ! r�pondit Fix, feignant la surprise, n'est-il pas avec
vous ?

-- Non, r�pondit Mrs. Aouda. Depuis hier, il n'a pas reparu. Se
serait-il embarqu� sans nous � bord du _Carnatic_ ?

-- Sans vous, madame ?... r�pondit l'agent. Mais, excusez ma
question, vous comptiez donc partir sur ce paquebot ?

-- Oui, monsieur.

-- Moi aussi, madame, et vous me voyez tr�s d�sappoint�. Le
_Carnatic_, ayant termin� ses r�parations, a quitt� Hong-Kong douze
heures plus t�t sans pr�venir personne, et maintenant il faudra
attendre huit jours le prochain d�part ! �

En pronon�ant ces mots : � huit jours �, Fix sentait son coeur bondir
de joie. Huit jours ! Fogg retenu huit jours � Hong-Kong ! On
aurait le temps de recevoir le mandat d'arr�t. Enfin, la chance se
d�clarait pour le repr�sentant de la loi.

Que l'on juge donc du coup d'assommoir qu'il re�ut, quand il entendit
Phileas Fogg dire de sa voix calme :

� Mais il y a d'autres navires que le _Carnatic_, il me semble, dans
le port de Hong-Kong. �

Et Mr. Fogg, offrant son bras � Mrs. Aouda, se dirigea vers les
docks � la recherche d'un navire en partance.

Fix, abasourdi, suivait. On e�t dit qu'un fil le rattachait � cet
homme.

Toutefois, la chance sembla v�ritablement abandonner celui qu'elle
avait si bien servi jusqu'alors. Phileas Fogg, pendant trois heures,
parcourut le port en tous sens, d�cid�, s'il le fallait, � fr�ter un
b�timent pour le transporter � Yokohama ; mais il ne vit que des
navires en chargement ou en d�chargement, et qui, par cons�quent, ne
pouvaient appareiller. Fix se reprit � esp�rer.

Cependant Mr. Fogg ne se d�concertait pas, et il allait continuer ses
recherches, d�t-il pousser jusqu'� Macao, quand il fut accost� par un
marin sur l'avant-port.

� Votre Honneur cherche un bateau ? lui dit le marin en se
d�couvrant.

-- Vous avez un bateau pr�t � partir demanda Mr. Fogg.

-- Oui, Votre Honneur, un bateau-pilote n� 43, le meilleur de la
flottille.

-- Il marche bien ?

-- Entre huit et neuf milles, au plus pr�s. Voulez-vous le voir ?

-- Oui.

-- Votre Honneur sera satisfait. Il s'agit d'une promenade en mer ?

-- Non. D'un voyage.

-- Un voyage ?

-- Vous chargez-vous de me conduire � Yokohama ? �

Le marin, � ces mots, demeura les bras ballants, les yeux �carquill�s.

� Votre Honneur veut rire ? dit-il.

-- Non ! j'ai manqu� le d�part du _Carnatic_, et il faut que je sois
le 14, au plus tard, � Yokohama, pour prendre le paquebot de San
Francisco.

-- Je le regrette, r�pondit le pilote, mais c'est impossible.

-- Je vous offre cent livres (2 500 F) par jour, et une prime de deux
cents livres si j'arrive � temps.

-- C'est s�rieux ? demanda le pilote.

-- Tr�s s�rieux �, r�pondit Mr. Fogg.

Le pilote s'�tait retir� � l'�cart. Il regardait la mer, �videmment
combattu entre le d�sir de gagner une somme �norme et la crainte de
s'aventurer si loin. Fix �tait dans des transes mortelles.

Pendant ce temps, Mr. Fogg s'�tait retourn� vers Mrs. Aouda.

� Vous n'aurez pas peur, madame ? lui demanda-t-il.

-- Avec vous, non, monsieur Fogg �, r�pondit la jeune femme.

Le pilote s'�tait de nouveau avanc� vers le gentleman, et tournait son
chapeau entre ses mains.

� Eh bien, pilote ? dit Mr. Fogg.

-- Eh bien, Votre Honneur, r�pondit le pilote, je ne puis risquer ni
mes hommes, ni moi, ni vous-m�me, dans une si longue travers�e sur un
bateau de vingt tonneaux � peine, et � cette �poque de l'ann�e.
D'ailleurs, nous n'arriverions pas � temps, car il y a seize cent
cinquante milles de Hong-Kong � Yokohama.

-- Seize cents seulement, dit Mr. Fogg.

-- C'est la m�me chose. �

Fix respira un bon coup d'air.

� Mais, ajouta le pilote, il y aurait peut-�tre moyen de s'arranger
autrement. �

Fix ne respira plus.

� Comment ? demanda Phileas Fogg.

-- En allant � Nagasaki, l'extr�mit� sud du Japon, onze cents milles,
ou seulement � Shanga�, � huit cents milles de Hong-Kong. Dans cette
derni�re travers�e, on ne s'�loignerait pas de la c�te chinoise, ce
qui serait un grand avantage, d'autant plus que les courants y portent
au nord.

-- Pilote, r�pondit Phileas Fogg, c'est � Yokohama que je dois prendre
la malle am�ricaine, et non � Shanga� ou � Nagasaki.

-- Pourquoi pas ? r�pondit le pilote. Le paquebot de San Francisco
ne part pas de Yokohama. Il fait escale � Yokohama et � Nagasaki,
mais son port de d�part est Shanga�.

-- Vous �tes certain de ce vous dites ?

-- Certain.

-- Et quand le paquebot quitte-t-il Shanga� ?

-- Le 11, � sept heures du soir. Nous avons donc quatre jours devant
nous. Quatre jours, c'est quatre-vingt-seize heures, et avec une
moyenne de huit milles � l'heure, si nous sommes bien servis, si le
vent tient au sud-est, si la mer est calme, nous pouvons enlever les
huit cents milles qui nous s�parent de Shanga�.

-- Et vous pourriez partir ?...

-- Dans une heure. Le temps d'acheter des vivres et d'appareiller.

-- Affaire convenue... Vous �tes le patron du bateau ?

-- Oui, John Bunsby, patron de la _Tankad�re_.

-- Voulez-vous des arrhes ?

-- Si cela ne d�soblige pas Votre Honneur.

-- Voici deux cents livres � compte... Monsieur, ajouta Phileas Fogg
en se retournant vers Fix, si vous voulez profiter...

-- Monsieur, r�pondit r�solument Fix, j'allais vous demander cette
faveur.

-- Bien. Dans une demi-heure nous serons � bord.

-- Mais ce pauvre gar�on... dit Mrs. Aouda, que la disparition de
Passepartout pr�occupait extr�mement.

-- Je vais faire pour lui tout ce que je puis faire �, r�pondit
Phileas Fogg.

Et, tandis que Fix, nerveux, fi�vreux, rageant, se rendait au
bateau-pilote, tous deux se dirig�rent vers les bureaux de la police
de Hong-Kong. L�, Phileas Fogg donna le signalement de Passepartout,
et laissa une somme suffisante pour le rapatrier. M�me formalit� fut
remplie chez l'agent consulaire fran�ais, et le palanquin, apr�s avoir
touch� � l'h�tel, o� les bagages furent pris, ramena les voyageurs �
l'avant-port.

Trois heures sonnaient. Le bateau-pilote n� 43, son �quipage � bord,
ses vivres embarqu�s, �tait pr�t � appareiller.

C'�tait une charmante petite go�lette de vingt tonneaux que la
_Tankad�re_, bien pinc�e de l'avant, tr�s d�gag�e dans ses fa�ons,
tr�s allong�e dans ses lignes d'eau. On e�t dit un yacht de course.
Ses cuivres brillants, ses ferrures galvanis�es, son pont blanc comme
de l'ivoire, indiquaient que le patron John Bunsby s'entendait � la
tenir en bon �tat. Ses deux m�ts s'inclinaient un peu sur l'arri�re.
Elle portait brigantine, misaine, trinquette, focs, fl�ches, et
pouvait gr�er une fortune pour le vent arri�re. Elle devait
merveilleusement marcher, et, de fait, elle avait d�j� gagn� plusieurs
prix dans les � matches � de bateaux-pilotes.

L'�quipage de la _Tankad�re_ se composait du patron John Bunsby et de
quatre hommes. C'�taient de ces hardis marins qui, par tous les
temps, s'aventurent � la recherche des navires, et connaissent
admirablement ces mers. John Bunsby, un homme de quarante-cinq ans
environ, vigoureux, noir de h�le, le regard vif, la figure �nergique,
bien d'aplomb, bien � son affaire, e�t inspir� confiance aux plus
craintifs.

Phileas Fogg et Mrs. Aouda pass�rent � bord. Fix s'y trouvait d�j�.
Par le capot d'arri�re de la go�lette, on descendait dans une chambre
carr�e, dont les parois s'�vidaient en forme de cadres, au dessus d'un
divan circulaire. Au milieu, une table �clair�e par une lampe de
roulis. C'�tait petit, mais propre.

� Je regrette de n'avoir pas mieux � vous offrir �, dit Mr. Fogg �
Fix, qui s'inclina sans r�pondre.

L'inspecteur de police �prouvait comme une sorte d'humiliation �
profiter ainsi des obligeances du sieur Fogg.

� A coup s�r, pensait-il, c'est un coquin fort poli, mais c'est un
coquin ! �

A trois heures dix minutes, les voiles furent hiss�es. Le pavillon
d'Angleterre battait � la corne de la go�lette. Les passagers �taient
assis sur le pont. Mr. Fogg et Mrs. Aouda jet�rent un dernier
regard sur le quai, afin de voir si Passepartout n'appara�trait pas.

Fix n'�tait pas sans appr�hension, car le hasard aurait pu conduire en
cet endroit m�me le malheureux gar�on qu'il avait si indignement
trait�, et alors une explication e�t �clat�, dont le d�tective ne se
f�t pas tir� � son avantage. Mais le Fran�ais ne se montra pas, et,
sans doute, l'abrutissant narcotique le tenait encore sous son
influence.

Enfin, le patron John Bunsby passa au large, et la _Tankad�re_,
prenant le vent sous sa brigantine, sa misaine et ses focs, s'�lan�a
en bondissant sur les flots.

                                 XXI
                         --------------------
              O� LE PATRON DE LA � TANKARD�RE� RISQUE FORT
               DE PERDRE UNE PRIME DE DEUX CENTS LIVRES

C'�tait une aventureuse exp�dition que cette navigation de huit cents
milles, sur une embarcation de vingt tonneaux, et surtout � cette
�poque de l'ann�e. Elles sont g�n�ralement mauvaises, ces mers de la
Chine, expos�es � des coups de vent terribles, principalement pendant
les �quinoxes, et on �tait encore aux premiers jours de novembre.

C'e�t �t�, bien �videmment, l'avantage du pilote de conduire ses
passagers jusqu'� Yokohama, puisqu'il �tait pay� tant par jour. Mais
son imprudence aurait �t� grande de tenter une telle travers�e dans
ces conditions, et c'�tait d�j� faire acte d'audace, sinon de
t�m�rit�, que de remonter jusqu'� Shanga�. Mais John Bunsby avait
confiance en sa _Tankad�re_, qui s'�levait � la lame comme une mauve,
et peut-�tre n'avait-il pas tort.

Pendant les derni�res heures de cette journ�e, la _Tankad�re_ navigua
dans les passes capricieuses de Hong-Kong, et sous toutes les allures,
au plus pr�s ou vent arri�re, elle se comporta admirablement.

� Je n'ai pas besoin, pilote, dit Phileas Fogg au moment o� la
go�lette donnait en pleine mer, de vous recommander toute la diligence
possible.

-- Que Votre Honneur s'en rapporte � moi, r�pondit John Bunsby. En
fait de voiles, nous portons tout ce que le vent permet de porter.
Nos fl�ches n'y ajouteraient rien, et ne serviraient qu'� assommer
l'embarcation en nuisant � sa marche.

-- C'est votre m�tier, et non le mien, pilote, et je me fie � vous. �

Phileas Fogg, le corps droit, les jambes �cart�es, d'aplomb comme un
marin, regardait sans broncher la mer houleuse. La jeune femme,
assise � l'arri�re, se sentait �mue en contemplant cet oc�an, assombri
d�j� par le cr�puscule, qu'elle bravait sur une fr�le embarcation.
Au-dessus de sa t�te se d�ployaient les voiles blanches, qui
l'emportaient dans l'espace comme de grandes ailes. La go�lette,
soulev�e par le vent, semblait voler dans l'air.

La nuit vint. La lune entrait dans son premier quartier, et son
insuffisante lumi�re devait s'�teindre bient�t dans les brumes de
l'horizon. Des nuages chassaient de l'est et envahissaient d�j� une
partie du ciel.

Le pilote avait dispos� ses feux de position, -- pr�caution
indispensable � prendre dans ces mers tr�s fr�quent�es aux approches
des atterrages. Les rencontres de navires n'y �taient pas rares, et,
avec la vitesse dont elle �tait anim�e, la go�lette se f�t bris�e au
moindre choc.

Fix r�vait � l'avant de l'embarcation. Il se tenait � l'�cart,
sachant Fogg d'un naturel peu causeur. D'ailleurs, il lui r�pugnait
de parler � cet homme, dont il acceptait les services. Il songeait
aussi � l'avenir. Cela lui paraissait certain que le sieur Fogg ne
s'arr�terait pas � Yokohama, qu'il prendrait imm�diatement le paquebot
de San Francisco afin d'atteindre l'Am�rique, dont la vaste �tendue
lui assurerait l'impunit� avec la s�curit�. Le plan de Phileas Fogg
lui semblait on ne peut plus simple.

Au lieu de s'embarquer en Angleterre pour les �tats-Unis, comme un
coquin vulgaire, ce Fogg avait fait le grand tour et travers� les
trois quarts du globe, afin de gagner plus s�rement le continent
am�ricain, o� il mangerait tranquillement le million de la Banque,
apr�s avoir d�pist� la police. Mais une fois sur la terre de l'Union,
que ferait Fix ? Abandonnerait-il cet homme ? Non, cent fois non !
et jusqu'� ce qu'il e�t obtenu un acte d'extradition, il ne le
quitterait pas d'une semelle. C'�tait son devoir, et il
l'accomplirait jusqu'au bout. En tout cas, une circonstance heureuse
s'�tait produite : Passepartout n'�tait plus aupr�s de son ma�tre, et
surtout, apr�s les confidences de Fix, il �tait important que le
ma�tre et le serviteur ne se revissent jamais.

Phileas Fogg, lui, n'�tait pas non plus sans songer � son domestique,
si singuli�rement disparu. Toutes r�flexions faites, il ne lui sembla
pas impossible que, par suite d'un malentendu, le pauvre gar�on ne se
f�t embarqu� sur le _Carnatic_, au dernier moment. C'�tait aussi
l'opinion de Mrs. Aouda, qui regrettait profond�ment cet honn�te
serviteur, auquel elle devait tant. Il pouvait donc se faire qu'on le
retrouv�t � Yokohama, et, si le _Carnatic_ l'y avait transport�, il
serait ais� de le savoir.

Vers dix heures, la brise vint � fra�chir. Peut-�tre e�t-il �t�
prudent de prendre un ris, mais le pilote, apr�s avoir soigneusement
observ� l'�tat du ciel, laissa la voilure telle qu'elle �tait �tablie.
D'ailleurs, la _Tankad�re_ portait admirablement la toile, ayant un
grand tirant d'eau, et tout �tait par� � amener rapidement, en cas de
grain.

A minuit, Phileas Fogg et Mrs. Aouda descendirent dans la cabine.
Fix les y avait pr�c�d�s, et s'�tait �tendu sur l'un des cadres.
Quant au pilote et � ses hommes, ils demeur�rent toute la nuit sur le
pont.

Le lendemain, 8 novembre, au lever du soleil, la go�lette avait fait
plus de cent milles. Le loch, souvent jet�, indiquait que la moyenne
de sa vitesse �tait entre huit et neuf milles. La _Tankad�re_ avait
du largue dans ses voiles qui portaient toutes et elle obtenait, sous
cette allure, son maximum de rapidit�. Si le vent tenait dans ces
conditions, les chances �taient pour elle.

La _Tankad�re_, pendant toute cette journ�e, ne s'�loigna pas
sensiblement de la c�te, dont les courants lui �taient favorables.
Elle l'avait � cinq milles au plus par sa hanche de b�bord, et cette
c�te, irr�guli�rement profil�e, apparaissait parfois � travers
quelques �claircies. Le vent venant de terre, la mer �tait moins
forte par l� m�me : circonstance heureuse pour la go�lette, car les
embarcations d'un petit tonnage souffrent surtout de la houle qui
rompt leur vitesse, qui � les tue �, pour employer l'expression
maritime.

Vers midi, la brise mollit un peu et h�la le sud-est. Le pilote fit
�tablir les fl�ches ; mais au bout de deux heures, il fallut les
amener, car le vent fra�chissait � nouveau.

Mr. Fogg et la jeune femme, fort heureusement r�fractaires au mal de
mer, mang�rent avec app�tit les conserves et le biscuit du bord. Fix
fut invit� � partager leur repas et dut accepter, sachant bien qu'il
est aussi n�cessaire de lester les estomacs que les bateaux, mais cela
le vexait ! Voyager aux frais de cet homme, se nourrir de ses propres
vivres, il trouvait � cela quelque chose de peu loyal. Il mangea
cependant, -- sur le pouce, il est vrai, -- mais enfin il mangea.

Toutefois, ce repas termin�, il crut devoir prendre le sieur Fogg �
part, et il lui dit :

� Monsieur... �

Ce � monsieur �lui �corchait les l�vres, et il se retenait pour ne pas
mettre la main au collet de ce � monsieur �!

� Monsieur, vous avez �t� fort obligeant en m'offrant passage � votre
bord. Mais, bien que mes ressources ne me permettent pas d'agir aussi
largement que vous, j'entends payer ma part...

-- Ne parlons pas de cela, monsieur, r�pondit Mr. Fogg.

-- Mais si, je tiens...

-- Non, monsieur, r�p�ta Fogg d'un ton qui n'admettait pas de
r�plique. Cela entre dans les frais g�n�raux ! �

Fix s'inclina, il �touffait, et, allant s'�tendre sur l'avant de la
go�lette, il ne dit plus un mot de la journ�e.

Cependant on filait rapidement. John Bunsby avait bon espoir.
Plusieurs fois il dit � Mr. Fogg qu'on arriverait en temps voulu �
Shanga�. Mr. Fogg r�pondit simplement qu'il y comptait. D'ailleurs,
tout l'�quipage de la petite go�lette y mettait du z�le. La prime
affriolait ces braves gens. Aussi, pas une �coute qui ne f�t
consciencieusement raidie ! Pas une voile qui ne f�t vigoureusement
�tarqu�e ! Pas une embard�e que l'on p�t reprocher � l'homme de
barre ! On n'e�t pas manoeuvr� plus s�v�rement dans une r�gate du
Royal-Yacht-Club.

Le soir, le pilote avait relev� au loch un parcours de deux cent vingt
milles depuis Hong-Kong, et Phileas Fogg pouvait esp�rer qu'en
arrivant � Yokohama, il n'aurait aucun retard � inscrire � son
programme. Ainsi donc, le premier contretemps s�rieux qu'il e�t
�prouv� depuis son d�part de Londres ne lui causerait probablement
aucun pr�judice.

Pendant la nuit, vers les premi�res heures du matin, la _Tankad�re_
entrait franchement dans le d�troit de Fo-Kien, qui s�pare la grande
�le Formose de la c�te chinoise, et elle coupait le tropique du
Cancer. La mer �tait tr�s dure dans ce d�troit, plein de remous
form�s par les contre-courants. La go�lette fatigua beaucoup. Les
lames courtes brisaient sa marche. Il devint tr�s difficile de se
tenir debout sur le pont.

Avec le lever du jour, le vent fra�chit encore. Il y avait dans le
ciel l'apparence d'un coup de vent. Du reste, le barom�tre annon�ait
un changement prochain de l'atmosph�re ; sa marche diurne �tait
irr�guli�re, et le mercure oscillait capricieusement. On voyait aussi
la mer se soulever vers le sud-est en longues houles � qui sentaient
la temp�te �. La veille, le soleil s'�tait couch� dans une brume
rouge, au milieu des scintillations phosphorescentes de l'oc�an.

Le pilote examina longtemps ce mauvais aspect du ciel et murmura entre
ses dents des choses peu intelligibles. A un certain moment, se
trouvant pr�s de son passager :

� On peut tout dire � Votre Honneur ? dit-il � voix basse.

-- Tout, r�pondit Phileas Fogg.

-- Eh bien, nous allons avoir un coup de vent.

-- Viendra-t-il du nord ou du sud ? demanda simplement Mr. Fogg.

-- Du sud. Voyez. C'est un typhon qui se pr�pare !

-- Va pour le typhon du sud, puisqu'il nous poussera du bon c�t�,
r�pondit Mr. Fogg.

-- Si vous le prenez comme cela, r�pliqua le pilote, je n'ai plus rien
� dire ! �

Les pressentiments de John Bunsby ne le trompaient pas. A une �poque
moins avanc�e de l'ann�e, le typhon, suivant l'expression d'un c�l�bre
m�t�orologiste, se f�t �coul� comme une cascade lumineuse de flammes
�lectriques, mais en �quinoxe hiver il �tait � craindre qu'il ne se
d�cha�n�t avec violence.

Le pilote prit ses pr�cautions par avance. Il fit serrer toutes les
voiles de la go�lette et amener les vergues sur le pont. Les mots de
fl�che furent d�pass�s. On rentra le bout-dehors. Les panneaux
furent condamn�s avec soin. Pas une goutte d'eau ne pouvait, d�s
lors, p�n�trer dans la coque de l'embarcation. Une seule voile
triangulaire, un tourmentin de forte toile, fut hiss� en guise de
trinquette, de mani�re � maintenir la go�lette vent arri�re. Et on
attendit.

John Bunsby avait engag� ses passagers � descendre dans la cabine ;
mais, dans un �troit espace, � peu pr�s priv� d'air, et par les
secousses de la houle, cet emprisonnement n'avait rien d'agr�able. Ni
Mr. Fogg, ni Mrs. Aouda, ni Fix lui-m�me ne consentirent � quitter
le pont.

Vers huit heures, la bourrasque de pluie et de rafale tomba � bord.
Rien qu'avec son petit morceau de toile, la _Tankad�re_ fut enlev�e
comme une plume par ce vent dont on ne saurait donner une id�e exacte,
quand il souffle en temp�te. Comparer sa vitesse � la quadruple
vitesse d'une locomotive lanc�e � toute vapeur, ce serait rester
au-dessous de la v�rit�.

Pendant toute la journ�e, l'embarcation courut ainsi vers le nord,
emport�e par les lames monstrueuses, en conservant heureusement une
rapidit� �gale � la leur. Vingt fois elle faillit �tre coiff�e par
une de ces montagnes d'eau qui se dressaient � l'arri�re ; mais un
adroit coup de barre, donn� par le pilote, parait la catastrophe. Les
passagers �taient quelquefois couverts en grand par les embruns qu'ils
recevaient philosophiquement. Fix maugr�ait sans doute, mais
l'intr�pide Aouda, les yeux fix�s sur son compagnon, dont elle ne
pouvait qu'admirer le sang-froid, se montrait digne de lui et bravait
la tourmente � ses c�t�s. Quant � Phileas Fogg, il semblait que ce
typhon f�t partie de son programme.

Jusqu'alors la _Tankad�re_ avait toujours fait route au nord ; mais
vers le soir, comme on pouvait le craindre, le vent, tournant de trois
quarts, h�la le nord-ouest. La go�lette, pr�tant alors le flanc � la
lame, fut effroyablement secou�e. La mer la frappait avec une
violence bien faite pour effrayer, quand on ne sait pas avec quelle
solidit� toutes les parties d'un b�timent sont reli�es entre elles.

Avec la nuit, la temp�te s'accentua encore. En voyant l'obscurit� se
faire, et avec l'obscurit� s'accro�tre la tourmente, John Bunsby
ressentit de vives inqui�tudes. Il se demanda s'il ne serait pas
temps de rel�cher, et il consulta son �quipage.

Ses hommes consult�s, John Bunsby s'approcha de Mr. Fogg, et lui dit
:

� Je crois, Votre Honneur, que nous ferions bien de gagner un des
ports de la c�te.

-- Je le crois aussi, r�pondit Phileas Fogg.

-- Ah ! fit le pilote, mais lequel ?

-- Je n'en connais qu'un, r�pondit tranquillement Mr. Fogg.

-- Et c'est !...

-- Shanga�. �

Cette r�ponse, le pilote fut d'abord quelques instants sans comprendre
ce qu'elle signifiait, ce qu'elle renfermait d'obstination et de
t�nacit�. Puis il s'�cria :

� Eh bien, oui ! Votre Honneur a raison. A Shanga� ! �

Et la direction de la _Tankad�re_ fut imperturbablement maintenue vers
le nord.

Nuit vraiment terrible ! Ce fut un miracle si la petite go�lette ne
chavira pas. Deux fois elle fut engag�e, et tout aurait �t� enlev� �
bord, si les saisines eussent manqu�. Mrs. Aouda �tait bris�e, mais
elle ne fit pas entendre une plainte. Plus d'une fois Mr. Fogg dut
se pr�cipiter vers elle pour la prot�ger contre la violence des lames.

Le jour reparut. La temp�te se d�cha�nait encore avec une extr�me
fureur. Toutefois, le vent retomba dans le sud-est. C'�tait une
modification favorable, et la _Tankad�re_ fit de nouveau route sur
cette mer d�mont�e, dont les lames se heurtaient alors � celles que
provoquait la nouvelle aire du vent. De l� un choc de contre-houles
qui e�t �cras� une embarcation moins solidement construite.

De temps en temps on apercevait la c�te � travers les brumes
d�chir�es, mais pas un navire en vue. La _Tankad�re_ �tait seule �
tenir la mer.

A midi, il y eut quelques sympt�mes d'accalmie, qui, avec
l'abaissement du soleil sur l'horizon, se prononc�rent plus nettement.

Le peu de dur�e de la temp�te tenait � sa violence m�me. Les
passagers, absolument bris�s, purent manger un peu et prendre quelque
repos.

La nuit fut relativement paisible. Le pilote fit r�tablir ses voiles
au bas ris. La vitesse de l'embarcation fut consid�rable. Le
lendemain, 11, au lever du jour, reconnaissance faite de la c�te, John
Bunsby put affirmer qu'on n'�tait pas � cent milles de Shanga�.

Cent milles, et il ne restait plus que cette journ�e pour les faire !
C'�tait le soir m�me que Mr. Fogg devait arriver � Shanga�, s'il ne
voulait pas manquer le d�part du paquebot de Yokohama. Sans cette
temp�te, pendant laquelle il perdit plusieurs heures, il n'e�t pas �t�
en ce moment � trente milles du port.

La brise mollissait sensiblement, mais heureusement la Mer tombait
avec elle. La go�lette se couvrit de toile. Fl�ches, voiles d'�tais,
contre-foc, tout portait, et la mer �cumait sous l'�trave.

A midi, la _Tankad�re_ n'�tait pas � plus de quarante-cinq milles de
Shanga�. Il lui restait six heures encore pour gagner ce port avant
le d�part du paquebot de Yokohama.

Les craintes furent vives � bord. On voulait arriver � tout prix.
Tous -- Phileas Fogg except� sans doute -- sentaient leur coeur battre
d'impatience. Il fallait que la petite go�lette se maintint dans une
moyenne de neuf milles � l'heure, et le vent mollissait toujours !
C'�tait une brise irr�guli�re, des bouff�es capricieuses venant de la
c�te. Elles passaient, et la mer se d�ridait aussit�t apr�s leur
passage.

Cependant l'embarcation �tait si l�g�re, ses voiles hautes, d'un fin
tissu, ramassaient si bien les folles brises, que, le courant aidant,
� six heures, John Bunsby ne comptait plus que dix milles jusqu'� la
rivi�re de Shanga�, car la ville elle-m�me est situ�e � une distance
de douze milles au moins au-dessus de l'embouchure.

A sept heures, on �tait encore � trois milles de Shanga�. Un
formidable juron s'�chappa des l�vres du pilote... La prime de deux
cents livres allait �videmment lui �chapper. Il regarda Mr. Fogg.
Mr. Fogg �tait impassible, et cependant sa fortune enti�re se jouait
� ce moment...

A ce moment aussi, un long fuseau noir, couronn� d'un panache de
fum�e, apparut au ras de l'eau. C'�tait le paquebot am�ricain, qui
sortait � l'heure r�glementaire.

� Mal�diction ! s'�cria John Bunsby, qui repoussa la barre d'un bras
d�sesp�r�.

-- Des signaux ! � dit simplement Phileas Fogg. Un petit canon de
bronze s'allongeait � l'avant de la _Tankad�re_. Il servait � faire
des signaux par les temps de brume.

Le canon fut charg� jusqu'� la gueule, mais au moment o� le pilote
allait appliquer un charbon ardent sur la lumi�re :

� Le pavillon en berne �, dit Mr. Fogg.

Le pavillon fut amen� � mi-m�t. C'�tait un signal de d�tresse, et
l'on pouvait esp�rer que le paquebot am�ricain, l'apercevant,
modifierait un instant sa route pour rallier l'embarcation.

� Feu ! � dit Mr. Fogg.

Et la d�tonation du petit canon de bronze �clata dans l'air.

                                 XXII
                         --------------------
          O� PASSEPARTOUT VOIT BIEN QUE, M�ME AUX ANTIPODES,
         IL EST PRUDENT D'AVOIR QUELQUE ARGENT DANS SA POCHE

Le _Carnatic_ ayant quitt� Hong-Kong, le 7 novembre, � six heures et
demie du soir, se dirigeait � toute vapeur vers les terres du Japon.
Il emportait un plein chargement de marchandises et de passagers.
Deux cabines de l'arri�re restaient inoccup�es. C'�taient celles qui
avaient �t� retenues pour le compte de Mr. Phileas Fogg.

Le lendemain matin, les hommes de l'avant pouvaient voir, non sans
quelque surprise, un passager, l'oeil � demi h�b�t�, la d�marche
branlante, la t�te �bouriff�e, qui sortait du capot des secondes et
venait en titubant s'asseoir sur une drome.

Ce passager, c'�tait Passepartout en personne. Voici ce qui �tait
arriv�.

Quelques instants apr�s que Fix eut quitt� la tabagie, deux gar�ons
avaient enlev� Passepartout profond�ment endormi, et l'avaient couch�
sur le lit r�serv� aux fumeurs. Mais trois heures plus tard,
Passepartout, poursuivi jusque dans ses cauchemars par une id�e fixe,
se r�veillait et luttait contre l'action stup�fiante du narcotique.
La pens�e du devoir non accompli secouait sa torpeur. Il quittait ce
lit d'ivrognes, et tr�buchant, s'appuyant aux murailles, tombant et se
relevant, mais toujours et irr�sistiblement pouss� par une sorte
d'instinct, il sortait de la tabagie, criant comme dans un r�ve : � Le
_Carnatic_ ! le _Carnatic_ ! �

Le paquebot �tait l� fumant, pr�t � partir. Passepartout n'avait que
quelques pas � faire. Il s'�lan�a sur le pont volant, il franchit la
coup�e et tomba inanim� � l'avant, au moment o� le _Carnatic_ larguait
ses amarres.

Quelques matelots, en gens habitu�s � ces sortes de sc�nes,
descendirent le pauvre gar�on dans une cabine des secondes, et
Passepartout ne se r�veilla que le lendemain matin, � cent cinquante
milles des terres de la Chine.

Voil� donc pourquoi, ce matin-l�, Passepartout se trouvait sur le pont
du _Carnatic_, et venait humer � pleine gorg�es les fra�ches brises de
la mer. Cet air pur le d�grisa. Il commen�a � rassembler ses id�es
et n'y parvint pas sans peine. Mais, enfin, il se rappela les sc�nes
de la veille, les confidences de Fix, la tabagie, etc.

� Il est �vident, se dit-il, que j'ai �t� abominablement gris� ! Que
va dire Mr. Fogg ? En tout cas, je n'ai pas manqu� le bateau, et
c'est le principal. �

Puis, songeant � Fix :

� Pour celui-l�, se dit-il, j'esp�re bien que nous en sommes
d�barrass�s, et qu'il n'a pas os�, apr�s ce qu'il m'a propos�, nous
suivre sur le _Carnatic_. Un inspecteur de police, un d�tective aux
trousses de mon ma�tre, accus� de ce vol commis � la Banque
d'Angleterre ! Allons donc ! Mr. Fogg est un voleur comme je suis
un assassin ! �

Passepartout devait-il raconter ces choses � son ma�tre ?
Convenait-il de lui apprendre le r�le jou� par Fix dans cette
affaire ? Ne ferait-il pas mieux d'attendre son arriv�e � Londres,
pour lui dire qu'un agent de la police m�tropolitaine l'avait fil�
autour du monde, et pour en rire avec lui ? Oui, sans doute. En tout
cas, question � examiner. Le plus press�, c'�tait de rejoindre Mr.
Fogg et de lui faire agr�er ses excuses pour cette inqualifiable
conduite.

Passepartout se leva donc. La mer �tait houleuse, et le paquebot
roulait fortement. Le digne gar�on, aux jambes peu solides encore,
gagna tant bien que mal l'arri�re du navire.

Sur le pont, il ne vit personne qui ressembl�t ni � son ma�tre, ni �
Mrs. Aouda.

� Bon, fit-il, Mrs. Aouda est encore couch�e � cette heure. Quant �
Mr. Fogg, il aura trouv� quelque joueur de whist, et suivant son
habitude... �

Ce disant, Passepartout descendit au salon. Mr. Fogg n'y �tait pas.
Passepartout n'avait qu'une chose � faire : c'�tait de demander au
purser quelle cabine occupait Mr. Fogg. Le purser lui r�pondit qu'il
ne connaissait aucun passager de ce nom.

� Pardonnez-moi, dit Passepartout en insistant. Il s'agit d'un
gentleman, grand, froid, peu communicatif, accompagn� d'une jeune
dame...

-- Nous n'avons pas de jeune dame � bord, r�pondit le purser. Au
surplus, voici la liste des passagers. Vous pouvez la consulter. �

Passepartout consulta la liste... Le nom de son ma�tre n'y figurait
pas.

Il eut comme un �blouissement. Puis une id�e lui traversa le cerveau.

� Ah �� ! je suis bien sur le _Carnatic_ ? s'�cria-t-il.

-- Oui, r�pondit le purser.

-- En route pour Yokohama ?

-- Parfaitement. �

Passepartout avait eu un instant cette crainte de s'�tre tromp� de
navire ! Mais s'il �tait sur le _Carnatic_, il �tait certain que son
ma�tre ne s'y trouvait pas.

Passepartout se laissa tomber sur un fauteuil. C'�tait un coup de
foudre. Et, soudain, la lumi�re se fit en lui. Il se rappela que
l'heure du d�part du _Carnatic_ avait �t� avanc�e, qu'il devait
pr�venir son ma�tre, et qu'il ne l'avait pas fait ! C'�tait donc sa
faute si Mr. Fogg et Mrs. Aouda avaient manqu� ce d�part !

Sa faute, oui, mais plus encore celle du tra�tre qui, pour le s�parer
de son ma�tre, pour retenir celui-ci � Hong-Kong, l'avait enivr�! Car
il comprit enfin la manoeuvre de l'inspecteur de police. Et
maintenant, Mr. Fogg, � coup s�r ruin�, son pari perdu, arr�t�,
emprisonn� peut-�tre !... Passepartout, � cette pens�e, s'arracha les
cheveux. Ah ! si jamais Fix lui tombait sous la main, quel r�glement
de comptes !

Enfin, apr�s le premier moment d'accablement, Passepartout reprit son
sang-froid et �tudia la situation. Elle �tait peu enviable. Le
Fran�ais se trouvait en route pour le Japon. Certain d'y arriver,
comment en reviendrait-il ? Il avait la poche vide. Pas un shilling,
pas un penny ! Toutefois, son passage et sa nourriture � bord �taient
pay�s d'avance. Il avait donc cinq ou six jours devant lui pour
prendre un parti. S'il mangea et but pendant cette travers�e, cela ne
saurait se d�crire. Il mangea pour son ma�tre, pour Mrs. Aouda et
pour lui-m�me. Il mangea comme si le Japon, o� il allait aborder, e�t
�t� un pays d�sert, d�pourvu de toute substance comestible.

Le 13, � la mar�e du matin, le _Carnatic_ entrait dans le port de
Yokohama.

Ce point est une rel�che importante du Pacifique, o� font escale tous
les steamers employ�s au service de la poste et des voyageurs entre
l'Am�rique du Nord, la Chine, le Japon et les �les de la Malaisie.
Yokohama est situ�e dans la baie m�me de Yeddo, � peu de distance de
cette immense ville, seconde capitale de l'empire japonais, autrefois
r�sidence du ta�koun, du temps que cet empereur civil existait, et
rivale de Meako, la grande cit� qu'habite le mikado, empereur
eccl�siastique, descendant des dieux.

Le _Carnatic_ vint se ranger au quai de Yokohama, pr�s des jet�es du
port et des magasins de la douane, au milieu de nombreux navires
appartenant � toutes les nations.

Passepartout mit le pied, sans aucun enthousiasme, sur cette terre si
curieuse des Fils du Soleil. Il n'avait rien de mieux � faire que de
prendre le hasard pour guide, et d'aller � l'aventure par les rues de
la ville.

Passepartout se trouva d'abord dans une cit� absolument europ�enne,
avec des maisons � basses fa�ades, orn�es de v�randas sous lesquelles
se d�veloppaient d'�l�gants p�ristyles, et qui couvrait de ses rues,
de ses places, de ses docks, de ses entrep�ts, tout l'espace compris
depuis le promontoire du Trait� jusqu'� la rivi�re. L�, comme �
Hong-Kong, comme � Calcutta, fourmillait un p�le-m�le de gens de
toutes races, Am�ricains, Anglais, Chinois, Hollandais, marchands
pr�ts � tout vendre et � tout acheter, au milieu desquels le Fran�ais
se trouvait aussi �tranger que s'il e�t �t� jet� au pays des
Hottentots.

Passepartout avait bien une ressource : c'�tait de se recommander pr�s
des agents consulaires fran�ais ou anglais �tablis � Yokohama ; mais
il lui r�pugnait de raconter son histoire, si intimement m�l�e � celle
de son ma�tre, et avant d'en venir l�, il voulait avoir �puis� toutes
les autres chances.

Donc, apr�s avoir parcouru la partie europ�enne de la ville, sans que
le hasard l'e�t en rien servi, il entra dans la partie japonaise,
d�cid�, s'il le fallait, � pousser jusqu'� Yeddo.

Cette portion indig�ne de Yokohama est appel�e Benten, du nom d'une
d�esse de la mer, ador�e sur les �les voisines. L� se voyaient
d'admirables all�es de sapins et de c�dres, des portes sacr�es d'une
architecture �trange, des ponts enfouis au milieu des bambous et des
roseaux, des temples abrit�s sous le couvert immense et m�lancolique
des c�dres s�culaires, des bonzeries au fond desquelles v�g�taient les
pr�tres du bouddhisme et les sectateurs de la religion de Confucius,
des rues interminables o� l'on e�t pu recueillir une moisson d'enfants
au teint rose et aux joues rouges, petits bonshommes qu'on e�t dit
d�coup�s dans quelque paravent indig�ne, et qui se jouaient au milieu
de caniches � jambes courtes et de chats jaun�tres, sans queue, tr�s
paresseux et tr�s caressants.

Dans les rues, ce n'�tait que fourmillement, va-et-vient incessant :
bonzes passant processionnellement en frappant leurs tambourins
monotones, yakounines, officiers de douane ou de police, � chapeaux
pointus incrust�s de laque et portant deux sabres � leur ceinture,
soldats v�tus de cotonnades bleues � raies blanches et arm�s de fusil
� percussion, hommes d'armes du mikado, ensach�s dans leur pourpoint
de soie, avec haubert et cotte de mailles, et nombre d'autres
militaires de toutes conditions, -- car, au Japon, la profession de
soldat est autant estim�e qu'elle est d�daign�e en Chine. Puis, des
fr�res qu�teurs, des p�lerins en longues robes, de simples civils,
chevelure lisse et d'un noir d'�b�ne, t�te grosse, buste long, jambes
gr�les, taille peu �lev�e, teint color� depuis les sombres nuances du
cuivre jusqu'au blanc mat, mais jamais jaune comme celui des Chinois,
dont les Japonais diff�rent essentiellement. Enfin, entre les
voitures, les palanquins, les chevaux, les porteurs, les brouettes �
voile, les � norimons � � parois de laque, les � cangos � moelleux,
v�ritables liti�res en bambou, on voyait circuler, � petits pas de
leur petit pied, chauss� de souliers de toile, de sandales de paille
ou de socques en bois ouvrag�, quelques femmes peu jolies, les yeux
brid�s, la poitrine d�prim�e, les dents noircies au go�t du jour, mais
portant avec �l�gance le v�tement national, le � kirimon �, sorte de
robe de chambre crois�e d'une �charpe de soie, dont la large ceinture
s'�panouissait derri�re en un noeud extravagant, -- que les modernes
Parisiennes semblent avoir emprunt� aux Japonaises.

Passepartout se promena pendant quelques heures au milieu de cette
foule bigarr�e, regardant aussi les curieuses et opulentes boutiques,
les bazars o� s'entasse tout le clinquant de l'orf�vrerie japonaise,
les � restaurations � orn�es de banderoles et de banni�res, dans
lesquelles il lui �tait interdit d'entrer, et ces maisons de th� o� se
boit � pleine tasse l'eau chaude odorante, avec le � saki �, liqueur
tir�e du riz en fermentation, et ces confortables tabagies o� l'on
fume un tabac tr�s fin, et non l'opium, dont l'usage est � peu pr�s
inconnu au Japon.

Puis Passepartout se trouva dans les champs, au milieu des immenses
rizi�res. L� s'�panouissaient, avec des fleurs qui jetaient leurs
derni�res couleurs et leurs derniers parfums, des cam�lias �clatants,
port�s non plus sur des arbrisseaux, mais sur des arbres, et, dans les
enclos de bambous, des cerisiers, des pruniers, des pommiers, que les
indig�nes cultivent plut�t pour leurs fleurs que pour leurs fruits, et
que des mannequins grima�ants, des tourniquets criards d�fendent
contre le bec des moineaux, des pigeons, des corbeaux et autres
volatiles voraces. Pas de c�dre majestueux qui n'abrit�t quelque
grand aigle ; pas de saule pleureur qui ne recouvr�t de son feuillage
quelque h�ron m�lancoliquement perch� sur une patte ; enfin, partout
des corneilles, des canards, des �perviers, des oies sauvages, et
grand nombre de ces grues que les Japonais traitent de �
Seigneuries �, et qui symbolisent pour eux la long�vit� et le bonheur.

En errant ainsi, Passepartout aper�ut quelques violettes entre les
herbes :

� Bon ! dit-il, voil� mon souper. �

Mais les ayant senties, il ne leur trouva aucun parfum.

� Pas de chance ! � pensa-t-il.

Certes, l'honn�te gar�on avait, par pr�vision, aussi copieusement
d�jeun� qu'il avait pu avant de quitter le _Carnatic_ ; mais apr�s une
journ�e de promenade, il se sentit l'estomac tr�s creux. Il avait
bien remarqu� que moutons, ch�vres ou porcs, manquaient absolument aux
�talages des bouchers indig�nes, et, comme il savait que c'est un
sacril�ge de tuer les boeufs, uniquement r�serv�s aux besoins de
l'agriculture, il en avait conclu que la viande �tait rare au Japon.
Il ne se trompait pas ; mais � d�faut de viande de boucherie, son
estomac se f�t fort accommod� des quartiers de sanglier ou de daim,
des perdrix ou des cailles, de la volaille ou du poisson, dont les
Japonais se nourrissent presque exclusivement avec le produit des
rizi�res. Mais il dut faire contre fortune bon coeur, et remit au
lendemain le soin de pourvoir � sa nourriture.

La nuit vint. Passepartout rentra dans la ville indig�ne, et il erra
dans les rues au milieu des lanternes multicolores, regardant les
groupes de baladins ex�cuter leurs prestigieux exercices, et les
astrologues en plein vent qui amassaient la foule autour de leur
lunette. Puis il revit la rade, �maill�e des feux de p�cheurs, qui
attiraient le poisson � la lueur de r�sines enflamm�es.

Enfin les rues se d�peupl�rent. A la foule succ�d�rent les rondes des
yakounines. Ces officiers, dans leurs magnifiques costumes et au
milieu de leur suite, ressemblaient � des ambassadeurs, et
Passepartout r�p�tait plaisamment, chaque fois qu'il rencontrait
quelque patrouille �blouissante :

� Allons, bon ! encore une ambassade japonaise qui part pour
l'Europe ! �

                                XXIII
                         --------------------
      DANS LEQUEL LE NEZ DE PASSEPARTOUT S'ALLONGE D�MESUR�MENT

Le lendemain, Passepartout, �reint�, affam�, se dit qu'il fallait
manger � tout prix, et que le plus t�t serait le mieux. Il avait bien
cette ressource de vendre sa montre, mais il f�t plut�t mort de faim.
C'�tait alors le cas ou jamais, pour ce brave gar�on, d'utiliser la
voix forte, sinon m�lodieuse, dont la nature l'avait gratifi�.

Il savait quelques refrains de France et d'Angleterre, et il r�solut
de les essayer. Les Japonais devaient certainement �tre amateurs de
musique, puisque tout se fait chez eux aux sons des cymbales, du
tam-tam et des tambours, et ils ne pouvaient qu'appr�cier les talents
d'un virtuose europ�en.

Mais peut-�tre �tait-il un peu matin pour organiser un concert, et les
dilettanti, inopin�ment r�veill�s, n'auraient peut-�tre pas pay� le
chanteur en monnaie � l'effigie du mikado.

Passepartout se d�cida donc � attendre quelques heures ; mais, tout en
cheminant, il fit cette r�flexion qu'il semblerait trop bien v�tu pour
un artiste ambulant, et l'id�e lui vint alors d'�changer ses v�tements
contre une d�froque plus en harmonie avec sa position. Cet �change
devait, d'ailleurs, produire une soulte, qu'il pourrait imm�diatement
appliquer � satisfaire son app�tit.

Cette r�solution prise, restait � l'ex�cuter. Ce ne fut qu'apr�s de
longues recherches que Passepartout d�couvrit un brocanteur indig�ne,
auquel il exposa sa demande. L'habit europ�en plut au brocanteur, et
bient�t Passepartout sortait affubl� d'une vieille robe japonaise et
coiff� d'une sorte de turban � c�tes, d�color� sous l'action du temps.
Mais, en retour, quelques pi�cettes d'argent r�sonnaient dans sa
poche.

� Bon, pensa-t-il, je me figurerai que nous sommes en carnaval ! �

Le premier soin de Passepartout, ainsi � japonais� �, fut d'entrer
dans une � tea-house � de modeste apparence, et l�, d'un reste de
volaille et de quelques poign�es de riz, il d�jeuna en homme pour qui
le d�ner serait encore un probl�me � r�soudre.

� Maintenant, se dit-il quand il fut copieusement restaur�, il s'agit
de ne pas perdre la t�te. Je n'ai plus la ressource de vendre cette
d�froque contre une autre encore plus japonaise. Il faut donc aviser
au moyen de quitter le plus promptement possible ce pays du Soleil,
dont je ne garderai qu'un lamentable souvenir ! �

Passepartout songea alors � visiter les paquebots en partance pour
l'Am�rique. Il comptait s'offrir en qualit� de cuisinier ou de
domestique, ne demandant pour toute r�tribution que le passage et la
nourriture. Une fois � San Francisco, il verrait � se tirer
d'affaire. L'important, c'�tait de traverser ces quatre mille sept
cents milles du Pacifique qui s'�tendent entre le Japon et le Nouveau
Monde.

Passepartout, n'�tant point homme � laisser languir une id�e, se
dirigea vers le port de Yokohama. Mais � mesure qu'il s'approchait
des docks, son projet, qui lui avait paru si simple au moment o� il en
avait eu l'id�e, lui semblait de plus en plus inex�cutable. Pourquoi
aurait-on besoin d'un cuisinier ou d'un domestique � bord d'un
paquebot am�ricain, et quelle confiance inspirerait-il, affubl� de la
sorte ? Quelles recommandations faire valoir ? Quelles r�f�rences
indiquer ?

Comme il r�fl�chissait ainsi, ses regards tomb�rent sur une immense
affiche qu'une sorte de clown promenait dans les rues de Yokohama.
Cette affiche �tait ainsi libell�e en anglais :

                     TROUPE JAPONAISE ACROBATIQUE

                                  DE

                     L'HONORABLE WILLIAM BATULCAR

                                ------

                      DERNI�RES REPR�SENTATIONS

           Avant leur d�part pour les �tats-Unis d'Am�rique

                                 DES

                         LONGS-NEZ-LONGS-NEZ

               SOUS L'INVOCATION DIRECTE DU DIEU TINGOU

                          Grande Attraction !

� Les �tats-Unis d'Am�rique ! s'�cria Passepartout, voil� justement
mon affaire !... �

Il suivit l'homme-affiche, et, � sa suite, il rentra bient�t dans la
ville japonaise. Un quart d'heure plus tard, il s'arr�tait devant une
vaste case, que couronnaient plusieurs faisceaux de banderoles, et
dont les parois ext�rieures repr�sentaient, sans perspective, mais en
couleurs violentes, toute une bande de jongleurs.

C'�tait l'�tablissement de l'honorable Batulcar, sorte de Barnum
am�ricain, directeur d'une troupe de saltimbanques, jongleurs, clowns,
acrobates, �quilibristes, gymnastes, qui, suivant l'affiche, donnait
ses derni�res repr�sentations avant de quitter l'empire du Soleil pour
les �tats de l'Union.

Passepartout entra sous un p�ristyle qui pr�c�dait la case, et demanda
Mr. Batulcar. Mr. Batulcar apparut en personne.

� Que voulez-vous ? dit-il � Passepartout, qu'il prit d'abord pour un
indig�ne.

-- Avez-vous besoin d'un domestique ? demanda Passepartout.

-- Un domestique, s'�cria le Barnum en caressant l'�paisse barbiche
grise qui foisonnait sous son menton, j'en ai deux, ob�issants,
fid�les, qui ne m'ont jamais quitt�, et qui me servent pour rien, �
condition que je les nourrisse... Et les voil�, ajouta-t-il en
montrant ses deux bras robustes, sillonn�s de veines grosses comme des
cordes de contrebasse.

-- Ainsi, je ne puis vous �tre bon � rien ?

-- A rien.

-- Diable ! �a m'aurait pourtant fort convenu de partir avec vous.

-- Ah �� ! dit l'honorable Batulcar, vous �tes Japonais comme je suis
un singe ! Pourquoi donc �tes-vous habill� de la sorte ?

-- On s'habille comme on peut !

-- Vrai, cela. Vous �tes un Fran�ais, vous ?

-- Oui, un Parisien de Paris.

-- Alors, vous devez savoir faire des grimaces ?

-- Ma foi, r�pondit Passepartout, vex� de voir sa nationalit�
provoquer cette demande, nous autres Fran�ais, nous savons faire des
grimaces, c'est vrai, mais pas mieux que les Am�ricains !

-- Juste. Eh bien, si je ne vous prends pas comme domestique, je peux
vous prendre comme clown. Vous comprenez, mon brave. En France, on
exhibe des farceurs �trangers, et � l'�tranger, des farceurs
fran�ais !

-- Ah !

-- Vous �tes vigoureux, d'ailleurs ?

-- Surtout quand je sors de table.

-- Et vous savez chanter ?

-- Oui, r�pondit Passepartout, qui avait autrefois fait sa partie dans
quelques concerts de rue.

-- Mais savez-vous chanter la t�te en bas, avec une toupie tournante
sur la plante du pied gauche, et un sabre en �quilibre sur la plante
du pied droit ?

-- Parbleu ! r�pondit Passepartout, qui se rappelait les premiers
exercices de son jeune �ge.

-- C'est que, voyez-vous, tout est l� ! � r�pondit l'honorable
Batulcar.

L'engagement fut conclu _hic et nunc_.

Enfin, Passepartout avait trouv� une position. Il �tait engag� pour
tout faire dans la c�l�bre troupe japonaise. C'�tait peu flatteur,
mais avant huit jours il serait en route pour San Francisco.

La repr�sentation, annonc�e � grand fracas par l'honorable Batulcar,
devait commencer � trois heures, et bient�t les formidables
instruments d'un orchestre japonais, tambours et tam-tams, tonnaient �
la porte. On comprend bien que Passepartout n'avait pu �tudier un
r�le, mais il devait pr�ter l'appui de ses solides �paules dans le
grand exercice de la � grappe humaine � ex�cut� par les Longs-Nez du
dieu Tingou. Ce � great attraction � de la repr�sentation devait
clore la s�rie des exercices.

Avant trois heures, les spectateurs avaient envahi la vaste case.
Europ�ens et indig�nes, Chinois et Japonais, hommes, femmes et
enfants, se pr�cipitaient sur les �troites banquettes et dans les
loges qui faisaient face � la sc�ne. Les musiciens �taient rentr�s �
l'int�rieur, et l'orchestre au complet, gongs, tam-tams, cliquettes,
fl�tes, tambourins et grosses caisses, op�raient avec fureur.

Cette repr�sentation fut ce que sont toutes ces exhibitions
d'acrobates. Mais il faut bien avouer que les Japonais sont les
premiers �quilibristes du monde. L'un, arm� de son �ventail et de
petits morceaux de papier, ex�cutait l'exercice si gracieux des
papillons et des fleurs. Un autre, avec la fum�e odorante de sa pipe,
tra�ait rapidement dans l'air une s�rie de mots bleu�tres, qui
formaient un compliment � l'adresse de l'assembl�e. Celui-ci jonglait
avec des bougies allum�es, qu'il �teignit successivement quand elles
pass�rent devant ses l�vres, et qu'il ralluma l'une � l'autre sans
interrompre un seul instant sa prestigieuse jonglerie. Celui-l�
reproduisit, au moyen de toupies tournantes, les plus invraisemblables
combinaisons ; sous sa main, ces ronflantes machines semblaient
s'animer d'une vie propre dans leur interminable giration ; elles
couraient sur des tuyaux de pipe, sur des tranchants de sabre, sur des
fils de fer, v�ritables cheveux tendus d'un c�t� de la sc�ne � l'autre
; elles faisaient le tour de grands vases de cristal, elles
gravissaient des �chelles de bambou, elles se dispersaient dans tous
les coins, produisant des effets harmoniques d'un �trange caract�re en
combinant leurs tonalit�s diverses. Les jongleurs jonglaient avec
elles, et elles tournaient dans l'air ; ils les lan�aient comme des
volants, avec des raquettes de bois, et elles tournaient toujours ;
ils les fourraient dans leur poche, et quand ils les retiraient, elles
tournaient encore, -- jusqu'au moment o� un ressort d�tendu les
faisait s'�panouir en gerbes d'artifice !

Inutile de d�crire ici les prodigieux exercices des acrobates et
gymnastes de la troupe. Les tours de l'�chelle, de la perche, de la
boule, des tonneaux, etc. furent ex�cut�s avec une pr�cision
remarquable. Mais le principal attrait de la repr�sentation �tait
l'exhibition de ces � Longs-Nez �, �tonnants �quilibristes que
l'Europe ne conna�t pas encore.

Ces Longs-Nez forment une corporation particuli�re plac�e sous
l'invocation directe du dieu Tingou. V�tus comme des h�rauts du Moyen
Age, ils portaient une splendide paire d'ailes � leurs �paules. Mais
ce qui les distinguait plus sp�cialement, c'�tait ce long nez dont
leur face �tait agr�ment�e, et surtout l'usage qu'ils en faisaient.
Ces nez n'�taient rien moins que des bambous, longs de cinq, de six,
de dix pieds, les uns droits, les autres courb�s, ceux-ci lisses,
ceux-l� verruqueux. Or, c'�tait sur ces appendices, fix�s d'une fa�on
solide, que s'op�raient tous leurs exercices d'�quilibre. Une
douzaine de ces sectateurs du dieu Tingou se couch�rent sur le dos, et
leurs camarades vinrent s'�battre sur leurs nez, dress�s comme des
paratonnerres, sautant, voltigeant de celui-ci � celui-l�, et
ex�cutant les tours les plus invraisemblables.

Pour terminer, on avait sp�cialement annonc� au public la pyramide
humaine, dans laquelle une cinquantaine de Longs-Nez devaient figurer
le � Char de Jaggernaut �. Mais au lieu de former cette pyramide en
prenant leurs �paules pour point d'appui, les artistes de l'honorable
Batulcar ne devaient s'emmancher que par leur nez. Or, l'un de ceux
qui formaient la base du char avait quitt� la troupe, et comme il
suffisait d'�tre vigoureux et adroit, Passepartout avait �t� choisi
pour le remplacer.

Certes, le digne gar�on se sentit tout piteux, quand -- triste
souvenir de sa jeunesse -- il eut endoss� son costume du Moyen Age,
orn� d'ailes multicolores, et qu'un nez de six pieds lui eut �t�
appliqu� sur la face ! Mais enfin, ce nez, c'�tait son gagne-pain, et
il en prit son parti.

Passepartout entra en sc�ne, et vint se ranger avec ceux de ses
coll�gues qui devaient figurer la base du Char de Jaggernaut. Tous
s'�tendirent � terre, le nez dress� vers le ciel. Une seconde section
d'�quilibristes vint se poser sur ces longs appendices, une troisi�me
s'�tagea au-dessus, puis une quatri�me, et sur ces nez qui ne se
touchaient que par leur pointe, un monument humain s'�leva bient�t
jusqu'aux frises du th��tre.

Or, les applaudissements redoublaient, et les instruments de
l'orchestre �clataient comme autant de tonnerres, quand la pyramide
s'�branla, l'�quilibre se rompit, un des nez de la base vint �
manquer, et le monument s'�croula comme un ch�teau de cartes...

C'�tait la faute � Passepartout qui, abandonnant son poste,
franchissant la rampe sans le secours de ses ailes, et grimpant � la
galerie de droite, tombait aux pieds d'un spectateur en s'�criant :

� Ah ! mon ma�tre ! mon ma�tre !

-- Vous ?

-- Moi !

-- Eh bien ! en ce cas, au paquebot, mon gar�on !... �

Mr. Fogg, Mrs. Aouda, qui l'accompagnait, Passepartout s'�taient
pr�cipit�s par les couloirs au-dehors de la case. Mais, l�, ils
trouv�rent l'honorable Batulcar, furieux, qui r�clamait des
dommages-int�r�ts pour � la casse �. Phileas Fogg apaisa sa fureur en
lui jetant une poign�e de bank-notes. Et, � six heures et demie, au
moment o� il allait partir, Mr. Fogg et Mrs. Aouda mettaient le pied
sur le paquebot am�ricain, suivis de Passepartout, les ailes au dos,
et sur la face ce nez de six pieds qu'il n'avait pas encore pu
arracher de son visage !

                                 XXIV
                         --------------------
               PENDANT LEQUEL S'ACCOMPLIT LA TRAVERS�E
                         DE L'OC�AN PACIFIQUE

Ce qui �tait arriv� en vue de Shanga�, on le comprend. Les signaux
faits par la _Tankad�re_ avaient �t� aper�us du paquebot de Yokohama.
Le capitaine, voyant un pavillon en berne, s'�tait dirig� vers la
petite go�lette. Quelques instants apr�s, Phileas Fogg, soldant son
passage au prix convenu, mettait dans la poche du patron John Bunsby
cinq cent cinquante livres (13 750 F). Puis l'honorable gentleman,
Mrs. Aouda et Fix �taient mont�s � bord du steamer, qui avait
aussit�t fait route pour Nagasaki et Yokohama.

Arriv� le matin m�me, 14 novembre, � l'heure r�glementaire, Phileas
Fogg, laissant Fix aller � ses affaires, s'�tait rendu � bord du
_Carnatic_, et l� il apprenait, � la grande joie de Mrs. Aouda -- et
peut-�tre � la sienne, mais du moins il n'en laissa rien para�tre --
que le Fran�ais Passepartout �tait effectivement arriv� la veille �
Yokohama.

Phileas Fogg, qui devait repartir le soir m�me pour San Francisco, se
mit imm�diatement � la recherche de son domestique. Il s'adressa,
mais en vain, aux agents consulaires fran�ais et anglais, et, apr�s
avoir inutilement parcouru les rues de Yokohama, il d�sesp�rait de
retrouver Passepartout, quand le hasard, ou peut-�tre une sorte de
pressentiment, le fit entrer dans la case de l'honorable Batulcar. Il
n'e�t certes point reconnu son serviteur sous cet excentrique
accoutrement de h�raut ; mais celui-ci, dans sa position renvers�e,
aper�ut son ma�tre � la galerie. Il ne put retenir un mouvement de
son nez. De l� rupture de l'�quilibre, et ce qui s'ensuivit.

Voil� ce que Passepartout apprit de la bouche m�me de Mrs. Aouda, qui
lui raconta alors comment s'�tait faite cette travers�e de Hong-Kong �
Yokohama, en compagnie d'un sieur Fix, sur la go�lette la _Tankad�re_.

Au nom de Fix, Passepartout ne sourcilla pas. Il pensait que le
moment n'�tait pas venu de dire � son ma�tre ce qui s'�tait pass�
entre l'inspecteur de police et lui. Aussi, dans l'histoire que
Passepartout fit de ses aventures, il s'accusa et s'excusa seulement
d'avoir �t� surpris par l'ivresse de l'opium dans une tabagie de
Yokohama.

Mr. Fogg �couta froidement ce r�cit, sans r�pondre ; puis il ouvrit �
son domestique un cr�dit suffisant pour que celui-ci p�t se procurer �
bord des habits plus convenables. Et, en effet, une heure ne s'�tait
pas �coul�e, que l'honn�te gar�on, ayant coup� son nez et rogn� ses
ailes, n'avait plus rien en lui qui rappel�t le sectateur du dieu
Tingou.

Le paquebot faisant la travers�e de Yokohama � San Francisco
appartenait � la Compagnie du � Pacific Mail steam �, et se nommait le
_General-Grant_. C'�tait un vaste steamer � roues, jaugeant deux
mille cinq cents tonnes, bien am�nag� et dou� d'une grande vitesse.
Un �norme balancier s'�levait et s'abaissait successivement au dessus
du pont ; � l'une de ses extr�mit�s s'articulait la tige d'un piston,
et � l'autre celle d'une bielle, qui, transformant le mouvement
rectiligne en mouvement circulaire, s'appliquait directement � l'arbre
des roues. Le _General-Grant_ �tait gr�� en trois-m�ts go�lette, et
il poss�dait une grande surface de voilure, qui aidait puissamment la
vapeur. A filer ses douze milles � l'heure, le paquebot ne devait pas
employer plus de vingt et un jours pour traverser le Pacifique.
Phileas Fogg �tait donc autoris� � croire que, rendu le 2 d�cembre �
San Francisco, il serait le 11 � New York et le 20 � Londres, --
gagnant ainsi de quelques heures cette date fatale du 21 d�cembre.

Les passagers �taient assez nombreux � bord du steamer, des Anglais,
beaucoup d'Am�ricains, une v�ritable �migration de coolies pour
l'Am�rique, et un certain nombre d'officiers de l'arm�e des Indes, qui
utilisaient leur cong� en faisant le tour du monde.

Pendant cette travers�e il ne se produisit aucun incident nautique.
Le paquebot, soutenu sur ses larges roues, appuy� par sa forte
voilure, roulait peu. L'oc�an Pacifique justifiait assez son nom.
Mr. Fogg �tait aussi calme, aussi peu communicatif que d'ordinaire.
Sa jeune compagne se sentait de plus en plus attach�e � cet homme par
d'autres liens que ceux de la reconnaissance. Cette silencieuse
nature, si g�n�reuse en somme, l'impressionnait plus qu'elle ne le
croyait, et c'�tait presque � son insu qu'elle se laissait aller � des
sentiments dont l'�nigmatique Fogg ne semblait aucunement subir
l'influence.

En outre, Mrs. Aouda s'int�ressait prodigieusement aux projets du
gentleman. Elle s'inqui�tait des contrari�t�s qui pouvaient
compromettre le succ�s du voyage. Souvent elle causait avec
Passepartout, qui n'�tait point sans lire entre les lignes dans le
coeur de Mrs. Aouda. Ce brave gar�on avait, maintenant, � l'�gard de
son ma�tre, la foi du charbonnier ; il ne tarissait pas en �loges sur
l'honn�tet�, la g�n�rosit�, le d�vouement de Phileas Fogg ; puis il
rassurait Mrs. Aouda sur l'issue du voyage, r�p�tant que le plus
difficile �tait fait, que l'on �tait sorti de ces pays fantastiques de
la Chine et du Japon, que l'on retournait aux contr�es civilis�es, et
enfin qu'un train de San Francisco � New York et un transatlantique de
New York � Londres suffiraient, sans doute, pour achever cet
impossible tour du monde dans les d�lais convenus.

Neuf jours apr�s avoir quitt� Yokohama, Phileas Fogg avait exactement
parcouru la moiti� du globe terrestre.

En effet, le _General-Grant_, le 23 novembre, passait au cent
quatre-vingti�me m�ridien, celui sur lequel se trouvent, dans
l'h�misph�re austral, les antipodes de Londres. Sur quatre-vingts
jours mis � sa disposition, Mr. Fogg, il est vrai, en avait employ�
cinquante-deux, et il ne lui en restait plus que vingt-huit �
d�penser. Mais il faut remarquer que si le gentleman se trouvait �
moiti� route seulement � par la diff�rence des m�ridiens �, il avait
en r�alit� accompli plus des deux tiers du parcours total. Quels
d�tours forc�s, en effet, de Londres � Aden, d'Aden � Bombay, de
Calcutta � Singapore, de Singapore � Yokohama ! A suivre
circulairement le cinquanti�me parall�le, qui est celui de Londres, la
distance n'e�t �t� que de douze mille milles environ, tandis que
Phileas Fogg �tait forc�, par les caprices des moyens de locomotion,
d'en parcourir vingt-six mille dont il avait fait environ dix-sept
mille cinq cents, � cette date du 23 novembre. Mais maintenant la
route �tait droite, et Fix n'�tait plus l� pour y accumuler les
obstacles !

Il arriva aussi que, ce 23 novembre, Passepartout �prouva une grande
joie. On se rappelle que l'ent�t� s'�tait obstin� � garder l'heure de
Londres � sa fameuse montre de famille, tenant pour fausses toutes les
heures des pays qu'il traversait. Or, ce jour-l�, bien qu'il ne l'e�t
jamais ni avanc�e ni retard�e, sa montre se trouva d'accord avec les
chronom�tres du bord.

Si Passepartout triompha, cela se comprend de reste. Il aurait bien
voulu savoir ce que Fix aurait pu dire, s'il e�t �t� pr�sent.

� Ce coquin qui me racontait un tas d'histoires sur les m�ridiens, sur
le soleil, sur la lune ! r�p�tait Passepartout. Hein ! ces
gens-l� ! Si on les �coutait, on ferait de la belle horlogerie !
J'�tais bien s�r qu'un jour ou l'autre, le soleil se d�ciderait � se
r�gler sur ma montre !... �

Passepartout ignorait ceci : c'est que si le cadran de sa montre e�t
�t� divis� en vingt-quatre heures comme les horloges italiennes, il
n'aurait eu aucun motif de triompher, car les aiguilles de son
instrument, quand il �tait neuf heures du matin � bord, auraient
indiqu� neuf heures du soir, c'est-�-dire la vingt et uni�me heure
depuis minuit, -- diff�rence pr�cis�ment �gale � celle qui existe
entre Londres et le cent quatre-vingti�me m�ridien.

Mais si Fix avait �t� capable d'expliquer cet effet purement physique,
Passepartout, sans doute, e�t �t� incapable, sinon de le comprendre,
du moins de l'admettre. Et en tout cas, si, par impossible,
l'inspecteur de police se f�t inopin�ment montr� � bord en ce moment,
il est probable que Passepartout, � bon droit rancunier, e�t trait�
avec lui un sujet tout diff�rent et d'une tout autre mani�re.

Or, o� �tait Fix en ce moment ?...

Fix �tait pr�cis�ment � bord du _General-Grant_.

En effet, en arrivant � Yokohama, l'agent, abandonnant Mr. Fogg qu'il
comptait retrouver dans la journ�e, s'�tait imm�diatement rendu chez
le consul anglais. L�, il avait enfin trouv� le mandat, qui, courant
apr�s lui depuis Bombay, avait d�j� quarante jours de date, -- mandat
qui lui avait �t� exp�di� de Hong-Kong par ce m�me _Carnatic_ � bord
duquel on le croyait. Qu'on juge du d�sappointement du d�tective !
Le mandat devenait inutile ! Le sieur Fogg avait quitt� les
possessions anglaises ! Un acte d'extradition �tait maintenant
n�cessaire pour l'arr�ter !

� Soit ! se dit Fix, apr�s le premier moment de col�re, mon mandat
n'est plus bon ici, il le sera en Angleterre. Ce coquin a tout l'air
de revenir dans sa patrie, croyant avoir d�pist� la police. Bien. Je
le suivrai jusque-l�. Quant � l'argent, Dieu veuille qu'il en reste !
Mais en voyages, en primes, en proc�s, en amendes, en �l�phant, en
frais de toute sorte, mon homme a d�j� laiss� plus de cinq mille
livres sur sa route. Apr�s tout, la Banque est riche ! �

Son parti pris, il s'embarqua aussit�t sur le _General-Grant_. Il
�tait � bord, quand Mr. Fogg et Mrs. Aouda y arriv�rent. A son
extr�me surprise, il reconnut Passepartout sous son costume de h�raut.
Il se cacha aussit�t dans sa cabine, afin d'�viter une explication qui
pouvait tout compromettre, -- et, gr�ce au nombre des passagers, il
comptait bien n'�tre point aper�u de son ennemi, lorsque ce jour-l�
pr�cis�ment il se trouva face � face avec lui sur l'avant du navire.

Passepartout sauta � la gorge de Fix, sans autre explication, et, au
grand plaisir de certains Am�ricains qui pari�rent imm�diatement pour
lui, il administra au malheureux inspecteur une vol�e superbe, qui
d�montra la haute sup�riorit� de la boxe fran�aise sur la boxe
anglaise.

Quand Passepartout eut fini, il se trouva calme et comme soulag�. Fix
se releva, en assez mauvais �tat, et, regardant son adversaire, il lui
dit froidement :

� Est-ce fini ?

-- Oui, pour l'instant.

-- Alors venez me parler.

-- Que je...

-- Dans l'int�r�t de votre ma�tre. �

Passepartout, comme subjugu� par ce sang-froid, suivit l'inspecteur de
police, et tous deux s'assirent � l'avant du steamer.

� Vous m'avez ross�, dit Fix. Bien. A pr�sent, �coutez-moi.
Jusqu'ici j'ai �t� l'adversaire de Mr. Fogg, mais maintenant je suis
dans son jeu.

-- Enfin ! s'�cria Passepartout, vous le croyez un honn�te homme ?

-- Non, r�pondit froidement Fix, je le crois un coquin... Chut ! ne
bougez pas et laissez-moi dire. Tant que Mr. Fogg a �t� sur les
possessions anglaises, j'ai eu int�r�t � le retenir en attendant un
mandat d'arrestation. J'ai tout fait pour cela. J'ai lanc� contre
lui les pr�tres de Bombay, je vous ai enivr� � Hong-Kong, je vous ai
s�par� de votre ma�tre, je lui ai fait manquer le paquebot de
Yokohama... �

Passepartout �coutait, les poings ferm�s.

� Maintenant, reprit Fix, Mr. Fogg semble retourner en Angleterre ?
Soit, je le suivrai. Mais, d�sormais, je mettrai � �carter les
obstacles de sa route autant de soin et de z�le que j'en ai mis
jusqu'ici � les accumuler. Vous le voyez, mon jeu est chang�, et il
est chang� parce que mon int�r�t le veut. J'ajoute que votre int�r�t
est pareil au mien, car c'est en Angleterre seulement que vous saurez
si vous �tes au service d'un criminel ou d'un honn�te homme ! �

Passepartout avait tr�s attentivement �cout� Fix, et il fut convaincu
que Fix parlait avec une enti�re bonne foi.

� Sommes-nous amis ? demanda Fix.

-- Amis, non, r�pondit Passepartout. Alli�s, oui, et sous b�n�fice
d'inventaire, car, � la moindre apparence de trahison, je vous tords
le cou.

-- Convenu �, dit tranquillement l'inspecteur de police.

Onze jours apr�s, le 3 d�cembre, le _General-Grant_ entrait dans la
baie de la Porte-d'Or et arrivait � San Francisco.

Mr. Fogg n'avait encore ni gagn� ni perdu un seul jour.

                                 XXV
                         --------------------
           O� L'ON DONNE UN L�GER APER�U DE SAN FRANCISCO,
                          UN JOUR DE MEETING

Il �tait sept heures du matin, quand Phileas Fogg, Mrs. Aouda et
Passepartout prirent pied sur le continent am�ricain, -- si toutefois
on peut donner ce nom au quai flottant sur lequel ils d�barqu�rent.
Ces quais, montant et descendant avec la mar�e, facilitent le
chargement et le d�chargement des navires. L� s'embossent les
clippers de toutes dimensions, les steamers de toutes nationalit�s, et
ces steam-boats � plusieurs �tages, qui font le service du Sacramento
et de ses affluents. L� s'entassent aussi les produits d'un commerce
qui s'�tend au Mexique, au P�rou, au Chili, au Br�sil, � l'Europe, �
l'Asie, � toutes les �les de l'oc�an Pacifique.

Passepartout, dans sa joie de toucher enfin la terre am�ricaine, avait
cru devoir op�rer son d�barquement en ex�cutant un saut p�rilleux du
plus beau style. Mais quand il retomba sur le quai dont le plancher
�tait vermoulu, il faillit passer au travers. Tout d�contenanc� de la
fa�on dont il avait � pris pied � sur le nouveau continent, l'honn�te
gar�on poussa un cri formidable, qui fit envoler une innombrable
troupe de cormorans et de p�licans, h�tes habituels des quais mobiles.

Mr. Fogg, aussit�t d�barqu�, s'informa de l'heure � laquelle partait
le premier train pour New York. C'�tait � six heures du soir. Mr.
Fogg avait donc une journ�e enti�re � d�penser dans la capitale
californienne. Il fit venir une voiture pour Mrs. Aouda et pour lui.
Passepartout monta sur le si�ge, et le v�hicule, � trois dollars la
course, se dirigea vers International-H�tel.

De la place �lev�e qu'il occupait, Passepartout observait avec
curiosit� la grande ville am�ricaine : larges rues, maisons basses
bien align�es, �glises et temples d'un gothique anglo-saxon, docks
immenses, entrep�ts comme des palais, les uns en bois, les autres en
brique ; dans les rues, voitures nombreuses, omnibus, � cars � de
tramways, et sur les trottoirs encombr�s, non seulement des Am�ricains
et des Europ�ens, mais aussi des Chinois et des Indiens, -- enfin de
quoi composer une population de plus de deux cent mille habitants.

Passepartout fut assez surpris de ce qu'il voyait. Il en �tait encore
� la cit� l�gendaire de 1849, � la ville des bandits, des incendiaires
et des assassins, accourus � la conqu�te des p�pites, immense
capharna�m de tous les d�class�s, o� l'on jouait la poudre l'or, un
revolver d'une main et un couteau de l'autre. Mais � ce beau temps �
�tait pass�. San Francisco pr�sentait l'aspect d'une grande ville
commer�ante. La haute tour de l'h�tel de ville, o� veillent les
guetteurs, dominait tout cet ensemble de rues et d'avenues, se coupant
� angles droits, entre lesquels s'�panouissaient des squares
verdoyants, puis une ville chinoise qui semblait avoir �t� import�e du
C�leste Empire dans une bo�te � joujoux. Plus de sombreros, plus de
chemises rouges � la mode des coureurs de placers, plus d'Indiens
emplum�s, mais des chapeaux de soie et des habits noirs, que portaient
un grand nombre de gentlemen dou�s d'une activit� d�vorante.
Certaines rues, entre autres Montgommery-street -- le R�gent-street de
Londres, le boulevard des Italiens de Paris, le Broadway de New York
--, �taient bord�es de magasins splendides, qui offraient � leur
�talage les produits du monde entier.

Lorsque Passepartout arriva � International-H�tel, il ne lui semblait
pas qu'il e�t quitt� l'Angleterre.

Le rez-de-chauss�e de l'h�tel �tait occup� par un immense � bar �,
sorte de buffet ouvert _gratis_ � tout passant. Viande s�che, soupe
aux hu�tres, biscuit et chester s'y d�bitaient sans que le
consommateur e�t � d�lier sa bourse. Il ne payait que sa boisson,
ale, porto ou x�r�s, si sa fantaisie le portait � se rafra�chir. Cela
parut � tr�s am�ricain � � Passepartout.

Le restaurant de l'h�tel �tait confortable. Mr. Fogg et Mrs. Aouda
s'install�rent devant une table et furent abondamment servis dans des
plats lilliputiens par des N�gres du plus beau noir.

Apr�s d�jeuner, Phileas Fogg, accompagn� de Mrs. Aouda, quitta
l'h�tel pour se rendre aux bureaux du consul anglais afin d'y faire
viser son passeport. Sur le trottoir, il trouva son domestique, qui
lui demanda si, avant de prendre le chemin de fer du Pacifique, il ne
serait pas prudent d'acheter quelques douzaines de carabines Enfield
ou de revolvers Colt. Passepartout avait entendu parler de Sioux et
de Pawnies, qui arr�tent les trains comme de simples voleurs
espagnols. Mr. Fogg r�pondit que c'�tait l� une pr�caution inutile,
mais il le laissa libre d'agir comme il lui conviendrait. Puis il se
dirigea vers les bureaux de l'agent consulaire.

Phileas Fogg n'avait pas fait deux cents pas que, � par le plus grand
des hasards �, il rencontrait Fix. L'inspecteur se montra extr�mement
surpris. Comment ! Mr. Fogg et lui avaient fait ensemble la
travers�e du Pacifique, et ils ne s'�taient pas rencontr�s � bord !
En tout cas, Fix ne pouvait �tre qu'honor� de revoir le gentleman
auquel il devait tant, et, ses affaires le rappelant en Europe, il
serait enchant� de poursuivre son voyage en une si agr�able compagnie.

Mr. Fogg r�pondit que l'honneur serait pour lui, et Fix -- qui tenait
� ne point le perdre de vue -- lui demanda la permission de visiter
avec lui cette curieuse ville de San Francisco. Ce qui fut accord�.

Voici donc Mrs. Aouda, Phileas Fogg et Fix fl�nant par les rues. Ils
se trouv�rent bient�t dans Montgommery-street, o� l'affluence du
populaire �tait �norme. Sur les trottoirs, au milieu de la chauss�e,
sur les rails des tramways, malgr� le passage incessant des coaches et
des omnibus, au seuil des boutiques, aux fen�tres de toutes les
maisons, et m�me jusque sur les toits, foule innombrable. Des
hommes-affiches circulaient au milieu des groupes. Des banni�res et
des banderoles flottaient au vent. Des cris �clataient de toutes
parts.

� Hurrah pour Kamerfield !

-- Hurrah pour Mandiboy ! �

C'�tait un meeting. Ce fut du moins la pens�e de Fix, et il
communiqua son id�e � Mr. Fogg, en ajoutant :

� Nous ferons peut-�tre bien, monsieur, de ne point nous m�ler � cette
cohue. Il n'y a que de mauvais coups � recevoir.

-- En effet, r�pondit Phileas Fogg, et les coups de poing, pour �tre
politiques, n'en sont pas moins des coups de poing ! �

Fix crut devoir sourire en entendant cette observation, et, afin de
voir sans �tre pris dans la bagarre, Mrs. Aouda, Phileas Fogg et lui
prirent place sur le palier sup�rieur d'un escalier que desservait une
terrasse, situ�e en contre-haut de Montgommery-street. Devant eux, de
l'autre c�t� de la rue, entre le wharf d'un marchand de charbon et le
magasin d'un n�gociant en p�trole, se d�veloppait un large bureau en
plein vent, vers lequel les divers courants de la foule semblaient
converger.

Et maintenant, pourquoi ce meeting ? A quelle occasion se tenait-il ?
Phileas Fogg l'ignorait absolument. S'agissait-il de la nomination
d'un haut fonctionnaire militaire ou civil, d'un gouverneur d'�tat ou
d'un membre du Congr�s ? Il �tait permis de le conjecturer, � voir
l'animation extraordinaire qui passionnait la ville.

En ce moment un mouvement consid�rable se produisit dans la foule.
Toutes les mains �taient en l'air. Quelques-unes, solidement ferm�es,
semblaient se lever et s'abattre rapidement au milieu des cris, --
mani�re �nergique, sans doute, de formuler un vote. Des remous
agitaient la masse qui refluait. Les banni�res oscillaient,
disparaissaient un instant et reparaissaient en loques. Les
ondulations de la houle se propageaient jusqu'� l'escalier, tandis que
toutes les t�tes moutonnaient � la surface comme une mer soudainement
remu�e par un grain. Le nombre des chapeaux noirs diminuait � vue
d'oeil, et la plupart semblaient avoir perdu de leur hauteur normale.

� C'est �videmment un meeting, dit Fix, et la question qui l'a
provoqu� doit �tre palpitante. Je ne serais point �tonn� qu'il f�t
encore question de l'affaire de l'_Alabama_, bien qu'elle soit
r�solue.

-- Peut-�tre, r�pondit simplement Mr. Fogg.

-- En tout cas, reprit Fix, deux champions sont en pr�sence l'un de
l'autre, l'honorable Kamerfield et l'honorable Mandiboy. �

Mrs. Aouda, au bras de Phileas Fogg, regardait avec surprise cette
sc�ne tumultueuse, et Fix allait demander � l'un de ses voisins la
raison de cette effervescence populaire, quand un mouvement plus
accus� se pronon�a. Les hurrahs, agr�ment�s d'injures, redoubl�rent.
La hampe des banni�res se transforma en arme offensive. Plus de
mains, des poings partout. Du haut des voitures arr�t�es, et des
omnibus enray�s dans leur course, s'�changeaient force horions. Tout
servait de projectiles. Bottes et souliers d�crivaient dans l'air des
trajectoires tr�s tendues, et il sembla m�me que quelques revolvers
m�laient aux vocif�rations de la foule leurs d�tonations nationales.

La cohue se rapprocha de l'escalier et reflua sur les premi�res
marches. L'un des partis �tait �videmment repouss�, sans que les
simples spectateurs pussent reconna�tre si l'avantage restait �
Mandiboy ou � Kamerfield.

� Je crois prudent de nous retirer, dit Fix, qui ne tenait pas � ce
que � son homme � re��t un mauvais coup ou se f�t une mauvaise
affaire. S'il est question de l'Angleterre dans tout ceci et qu'on
nous reconnaisse, nous serons fort compromis dans la bagarre !

-- Un citoyen anglais... �, r�pondit Phileas Fogg.

Mais le gentleman ne put achever sa phrase. Derri�re lui, de cette
terrasse qui pr�c�dait l'escalier, partirent des hurlements
�pouvantables. On criait : � Hurrah ! Hip ! Hip ! pour
Mandiboy ! � C'�tait une troupe d'�lecteurs qui arrivait � la
rescousse, prenant en flanc les partisans de Kamerfield.

Mr. Fogg, Mrs. Aouda, Fix se trouv�rent entre deux feux. Il �tait
trop tard pour s'�chapper. Ce torrent d'hommes, arm�s de cannes
plomb�es et de casse-t�te, �tait irr�sistible. Phileas Fogg et Fix,
en pr�servant la jeune femme, furent horriblement bouscul�s. Mr.
Fogg, non moins flegmatique que d'habitude, voulut se d�fendre avec
ces armes naturelles que la nature a mises au bout des bras de tout
Anglais, mais inutilement. Un �norme gaillard � barbiche rouge, au
teint color�, large d'�paules, qui paraissait �tre le chef de la
bande, leva son formidable poing sur Mr. Fogg, et il e�t fort
endommag� le gentleman, si Fix, par d�vouement, n'e�t re�u le coup �
sa place. Une �norme bosse se d�veloppa instantan�ment sous le
chapeau de soie du d�tective, transform� en simple toque.

� Yankee ! dit Mr. Fogg, en lan�ant � son adversaire un regard de
profond m�pris.

-- Englishman ! r�pondit l'autre.

-- Nous nous retrouverons !

-- Quand il vous plaira. -- Votre nom ?

-- Phileas Fogg. Le v�tre ?

-- Le colonel Stamp W. Proctor. �

Puis, cela dit, la mar�e passa. Fix fut renvers� et se releva, les
habits d�chir�s, mais sans meurtrissure s�rieuse. Son paletot de
voyage s'�tait s�par� en deux parties in�gales, et son pantalon
ressemblait � ces culottes dont certains Indiens -- affaire de mode --
ne se v�tent qu'apr�s en avoir pr�alablement enlev� le fond. Mais, en
somme, Mrs. Aouda avait �t� �pargn�e, et, seul, Fix en �tait pour son
coup de poing.

� Merci, dit Mr. Fogg � l'inspecteur, d�s qu'ils furent hors de la
foule.

-- Il n'y a pas de quoi, r�pondit Fix, mais venez.

-- O� ?

-- Chez un marchand de confection. �

En effet, cette visite �tait opportune. Les habits de Phileas Fogg et
de Fix �taient en lambeaux, comme si ces deux gentlemen se fussent
battus pour le compte des honorables Kamerfield et Mandiboy.

Une heure apr�s, ils �taient convenablement v�tus et coiff�s. Puis
ils revinrent � International-H�tel.

L�, Passepartout attendait son ma�tre, arm� d'une demi-douzaine de
revolvers-poignards � six coups et � inflammation centrale. Quand il
aper�ut Fix en compagnie de Mr. Fogg, son front s'obscurcit. Mais
Mrs. Aouda, ayant fait en quelques mots le r�cit de ce qui s'�tait
pass�, Passepartout se rass�r�na. �videmment Fix n'�tait plus un
ennemi, c'�tait un alli�. Il tenait sa parole.

Le d�ner termin�, un coach fut amen�, qui devait conduire � la gare
les voyageurs et leurs colis. Au moment de monter en voiture, Mr.
Fogg dit � Fix :

� Vous n'avez pas revu ce colonel Proctor ?

-- Non, r�pondit Fix.

-- Je reviendrai en Am�rique pour le retrouver, dit froidement Phileas
Fogg. Il ne serait pas convenable qu'un citoyen anglais se laiss�t
traiter de cette fa�on. �

L'inspecteur sourit et ne r�pondit pas. Mais, on le voit, Mr. Fogg
�tait de cette race d'Anglais qui, s'ils ne tol�rent pas le duel chez
eux, se battent � l'�tranger, quand il s'agit de soutenir leur
honneur.

A six heures moins un quart, les voyageurs atteignaient la gare et
trouvaient le train pr�t � partir. Au moment o� Mr. Fogg allait
s'embarquer, il avisa un employ� et le rejoignant :

� Mon ami, lui dit-il, n'y a-t-il pas eu quelques troubles aujourd'hui
� San Francisco ?

-- C'�tait un meeting, monsieur, r�pondit l'employ�.

-- Cependant, j'ai cru remarquer une certaine animation dans les rues.

-- Il s'agissait simplement d'un meeting organis� pour une �lection.

-- L'�lection d'un g�n�ral en chef, sans doute ? demanda Mr. Fogg.

-- Non, monsieur, d'un juge de paix. �

Sur cette r�ponse, Phileas Fogg monta dans le wagon, et le train
partit � toute vapeur.

                                 XXVI
                         --------------------
           DANS LEQUEL ON PREND LE TRAIN EXPRESS DU CHEMIN
                         DE FER DU PACIFIQUE

� Ocean to Ocean � -- ainsi disent les Am�ricains --, et ces trois
mots devraient �tre la d�nomination g�n�rale du � grand trunk �, qui
traverse les �tats-Unis d'Am�rique dans leur plus grande largeur.
Mais, en r�alit�, le � Pacific rail-road � se divise en deux parties
distinctes : � Central Pacific � entre San Francisco et Ogden, et �
Union Pacific � entre Ogden et Omaha. L� se raccordent cinq lignes
distinctes, qui mettent Omaha en communication fr�quente avec New
York.

New York et San Francisco sont donc pr�sentement r�unis par un ruban
de m�tal non interrompu qui ne mesure pas moins de trois mille sept
cent quatre-vingt-six milles. Entre Omaha et le Pacifique, le chemin
de fer franchit une contr�e encore fr�quent�e par les Indiens et les
fauves, -- vaste �tendue de territoire que les Mormons commenc�rent �
coloniser vers 1845, apr�s qu'ils eurent �t� chass�s de l'Illinois.

Autrefois, dans les circonstances les plus favorables, on employait
six mois pour aller de New York � San Francisco. Maintenant, on met
sept jours.

C'est en 1862 que, malgr� l'opposition des d�put�s du Sud, qui
voulaient une ligne plus m�ridionale, le trac� du rail-road fut arr�t�
entre le quarante et uni�me et le quarante-deuxi�me parall�le. Le
pr�sident Lincoln, de si regrett�e m�moire, fixa lui-m�me, dans l'�tat
de Nebraska, � la ville d'Omaha, la t�te de ligne du nouveau r�seau.
Les travaux furent aussit�t commenc�s et poursuivis avec cette
activit� am�ricaine, qui n'est ni paperassi�re ni bureaucratique. La
rapidit� de la main-d'oeuvre ne devait nuire en aucune fa�on � la
bonne ex�cution du chemin. Dans la prairie, on avan�ait � raison d'un
mille et demi par jour. Une locomotive, roulant sur les rails de la
veille, apportait les rails du lendemain, et courait � leur surface au
fur et � mesure qu'ils �taient pos�s.

Le Pacific rail-road jette plusieurs embranchements sur son parcours,
dans les �tats de Iowa, du Kansas, du Colorado et de l'Oregon. En
quittant Omaha, il longe la rive gauche de Platte-river jusqu'�
l'embouchure de la branche du nord, suit la branche du sud, traverse
les terrains de Laramie et les montagnes Wahsatch, contourne le lac
Sal�, arrive � Lake Salt City, la capitale des Mormons, s'enfonce dans
la vall�e de la Tuilla, longe le d�sert am�ricain, les monts de C�dar
et Humboldt, Humboldt-river, la Sierra Nevada, et redescend par
Sacramento jusqu'au Pacifique, sans que ce trac� d�passe en pente cent
douze pieds par mille, m�me dans la travers�e des montagnes Rocheuses.

Telle �tait cette longue art�re que les trains parcouraient en sept
jours, et qui allait permettre � l'honorable Phileas Fogg -- il
l'esp�rait du moins -- de prendre, le 11, � New York, le paquebot de
Liverpool.

Le wagon occup� par Phileas Fogg �tait une sorte de long omnibus qui
reposait sur deux trains form�s de quatre roues chacun, dont la
mobilit� permet d'attaquer des courbes de petit rayon. A l'int�rieur,
point de compartiments : deux files de si�ges, dispos�s de chaque
c�t�, perpendiculairement � l'axe, et entre lesquels �tait r�serv� un
passage conduisant aux cabinets de toilette et autres, dont chaque
wagon est pourvu. Sur toute la longueur du train, les voitures
communiquaient entre elles par des passerelles, et les voyageurs
pouvaient circuler d'une extr�mit� � l'autre du convoi, qui mettait �
leur disposition des wagons-salons, des wagons-terrasses, des
wagons-restaurants et des wagons � caf�s. Il n'y manquait que des
wagons-th��tres. Mais il y en aura un jour.

Sur les passerelles circulaient incessamment des marchands de livres
et de journaux, d�bitant leur marchandise, et des vendeurs de
liqueurs, de comestibles, de cigares, qui ne manquaient point de
chalands.

Les voyageurs �taient partis de la station d'Oakland � six heures du
soir. Il faisait d�j� nuit, -- une nuit froide, sombre, avec un ciel
couvert dont les nuages mena�aient de se r�soudre en neige. Le train
ne marchait pas avec une grande rapidit�. En tenant compte des
arr�ts, il ne parcourait pas plus de vingt milles � l'heure, vitesse
qui devait, cependant, lui permettre de franchir les �tats-Unis dans
les temps r�glementaires.

On causait peu dans le wagon. D'ailleurs, le sommeil allait bient�t
gagner les voyageurs. Passepartout se trouvait plac� aupr�s de
l'inspecteur de police, mais il ne lui parlait pas. Depuis les
derniers �v�nements, leurs relations s'�taient notablement refroidies.
Plus de sympathie, plus d'intimit�. Fix n'avait rien chang� � sa
mani�re d'�tre, mais Passepartout se tenait, au contraire, sur une
extr�me r�serve, pr�t au moindre soup�on � �trangler son ancien ami.

Une heure apr�s le d�part du train, la neige tomba --, neige fine, qui
ne pouvait, fort heureusement, retarder la marche du convoi. On
n'apercevait plus � travers les fen�tres qu'une immense nappe blanche,
sur laquelle, en d�roulant ses volutes, la vapeur de la locomotive
paraissait gris�tre.

A huit heures, un � steward � entra dans le wagon et annon�a aux
voyageurs que l'heure du coucher �tait sonn�e. Ce wagon �tait un
� sleeping-car �, qui, en quelques minutes, fut transform� en dortoir.
Les dossiers des bancs se repli�rent, des couchettes soigneusement
paquet�es se d�roul�rent par un syst�me ing�nieux, des cabines furent
improvis�es en quelques instants, et chaque voyageur eut bient�t � sa
disposition un lit confortable, que d'�pais rideaux d�fendaient contre
tout regard indiscret. Les draps �taient blancs, les oreillers
moelleux. Il n'y avait plus qu'� se coucher et � dormir -- ce que
chacun fit, comme s'il se f�t trouv� dans la cabine confortable d'un
paquebot --, pendant que le train filait � toute vapeur � travers
l'�tat de Californie.

Dans cette portion du territoire qui s'�tend entre San Francisco et
Sacramento, le sol est peu accident�. Cette partie du chemin de fer,
sous le nom de � Central Pacific road �, prit d'abord Sacramento pour
point de d�part, et s'avan�a vers l'est � la rencontre de celui qui
partait d'Omaha. De San Francisco � la capitale de la Californie, la
ligne courait directement au nord-est, en longeant American-river, qui
se jette dans la baie de San Pablo. Les cent vingt milles compris
entre ces deux importantes cit�s furent franchis en six heures, et
vers minuit, pendant qu'ils dormaient de leur premier sommeil, les
voyageurs pass�rent � Sacramento. Ils ne virent donc rien de cette
ville consid�rable, si�ge de la l�gislature de l'�tat de Californie,
ni ses beaux quais, ni ses rues larges, ni ses h�tels splendides, ni
ses squares, ni ses temples.

En sortant de Sacramento, le train, apr�s avoir d�pass� les stations
de Junction, de Roclin, d'Auburn et de Colfax, s'engagea dans le
massif de la Sierra Nevada. Il �tait sept heures du matin quand fut
travers�e la station de Cisco. Une heure apr�s, le dortoir �tait
redevenu un wagon ordinaire et les voyageurs pouvaient � travers les
vitres entrevoir les points de vue pittoresques de ce montagneux pays.
Le trac� du train ob�issait aux caprices de la Sierra, ici accroch�
aux flancs de la montagne, l� suspendu au-dessus des pr�cipices,
�vitant les angles brusques par des courbes audacieuses, s'�lan�ant
dans des gorges �troites que l'on devait croire sans issues. La
locomotive, �tincelante comme une ch�sse, avec son grand fanal qui
jetait de fauves lueurs, sa cloche argent�e, son � chasse-vache �, qui
s'�tendait comme un �peron, m�lait ses sifflements et ses mugissements
� ceux des torrent et des cascades, et tordait sa fum�e � la noire
ramure des sapins.

Peu ou point de tunnels, ni de pont sur le parcours. Le rail-road
contournait le flanc des montagnes, ne cherchant pas dans la ligne
droite le plus court chemin d'un point � un autre, et ne violentant
pas la nature.

Vers neuf heures, par la vall�e de Carson, le train p�n�trait dans
l'�tat de Nevada, suivant toujours la direction du nord-est. A midi,
il quittait Reno, o� les voyageurs eurent vingt minutes pour d�jeuner.

Depuis ce point, la voie ferr�e, c�toyant Humboldt-river, s'�leva
pendant quelques milles vers le nord, en suivant son cours. Puis elle
s'infl�chit vers l'est, et ne devait plus quitter le cours d'eau avant
d'avoir atteint les Humboldt-Ranges, qui lui donnent naissance,
presque � l'extr�mit� orientale de l'�tat du Nevada.

Apr�s avoir d�jeun�, Mr. Fogg, Mrs. Aouda et leurs compagnons
reprirent leur place dans le wagon. Phileas Fogg, la jeune femme, Fix
et Passepartout, confortablement assis, regardaient le paysage vari�
qui passait sous leurs yeux, -- vastes prairies, montagnes se
profilant � l'horizon, � creeks � roulant leurs eaux �cumeuses.
Parfois, un grand troupeau de bisons, se massant au loin, apparaissait
comme une digue mobile. Ces innombrables arm�es de ruminants opposent
souvent un insurmontable obstacle au passage des trains. On a vu des
milliers de ces animaux d�filer pendant plusieurs heures, en rangs
press�s, au travers du rail-road. La locomotive est alors forc�e de
s'arr�ter et d'attendre que la voie soit redevenue libre.

Ce fut m�me ce qui arriva dans cette occasion. Vers trois heures du
soir, un troupeau de dix � douze mille t�tes barra le rail-road. La
machine, apr�s avoir mod�r� sa vitesse, essaya d'engager son �peron
dans le flanc de l'immense colonne, mais elle dut s'arr�ter devant
l'imp�n�trable masse.

On voyait ces ruminants -- ces buffalos, comme les appellent
improprement les Am�ricains -- marcher ainsi de leur pas tranquille,
poussant parfois des beuglements formidables. Ils avaient une taille
sup�rieure � celle des taureaux d'Europe, les jambes et la queue
courtes, le garrot saillant qui formait une bosse musculaire, les
cornes �cart�es � la base, la t�te, le cou et les �paul�s recouverts
d'une crini�re � longs poils. Il ne fallait pas songer � arr�ter
cette migration. Quand les bisons ont adopt� une direction, rien ne
pourrait ni enrayer ni modifier leur marche. C'est un torrent de
chair vivante qu'aucune digue ne saurait contenir.

Les voyageurs, dispers�s sur les passerelles, regardaient ce curieux
spectacle. Mais celui qui devait �tre le plus press� de tous, Phileas
Fogg, �tait demeur� � sa place et attendait philosophiquement qu'il
pl�t aux buffles de lui livrer passage. Passepartout �tait furieux du
retard que causait cette agglom�ration d'animaux. Il e�t voulu
d�charger contre eux son arsenal de revolvers.

� Quel pays ! s'�cria-t-il. De simples boeufs qui arr�tent des
trains, et qui s'en vont l�, processionnellement, sans plus se h�ter
que s'ils ne g�naient pas la circulation ! Pardieu ! je voudrais
bien savoir si Mr. Fogg avait pr�vu ce contretemps dans son
programme ! Et ce m�canicien qui n'ose pas lancer sa machine �
travers ce b�tail encombrant ! �

Le m�canicien n'avait point tent� de renverser l'obstacle, et il avait
prudemment agi. Il e�t �cras� sans doute les premiers buffles
attaqu�s par l'�peron de la locomotive ; mais, si puissante qu'elle
f�t, la machine e�t �t� arr�t�e bient�t, un d�raillement se serait
in�vitablement produit, et le train f�t rest� en d�tresse.

Le mieux �tait donc d'attendre patiemment, quitte ensuite � regagner
le temps perdu par une acc�l�ration de la marche du train. Le d�fil�
des bisons dura trois grandes heures, et la voie ne redevint libre
qu'� la nuit tombante. A ce moment, les derniers rangs du troupeau
traversaient les rails, tandis que les premiers disparaissaient
au-dessous de l'horizon du sud.

Il �tait donc huit heures, quand le train franchit les d�fil�s des
Humboldt-Ranges, et neuf heures et demie, lorsqu'il p�n�tra sur le
territoire de l'Utah, la r�gion du grand lac Sal�, le curieux pays des
Mormons.

                                XXVII
                         --------------------
          DANS LEQUEL PASSEPARTOUT SUIT, AVEC UNE VITESSE DE
         VINGT MILLES A L'HEURE, UN COURS D'HISTOIRE MORMONE

Pendant la nuit du 5 au 6 d�cembre, le train courut au sud-est sur un
espace de cinquante milles environ ; puis il remonta d'autant vers le
nord-est, en s'approchant du grand lac Sal�.

Passepartout, vers neuf heures du matin, vint prendre l'air sur les
passerelles. Le temps �tait froid, le ciel gris, mais il ne neigeait
plus. Le disque du soleil, �largi par les brumes, apparaissait comme
une �norme pi�ce d'or, et Passepartout s'occupait � en calculer la
valeur en livres sterling, quand il fut distrait de cet utile travail
par l'apparition d'un personnage assez �trange.

Ce personnage, qui avait pris le train � la station d'Elko, �tait un
homme de haute taille, tr�s brun, moustaches noires, bas noirs,
chapeau de soie noir, gilet noir, pantalon noir, cravate blanche,
gants de peau de chien. On e�t dit un r�v�rend. Il allait d'une
extr�mit� du train � l'autre, et, sur la porti�re de chaque wagon, il
collait avec des pains � cacheter une notice �crite � la main.

Passepartout s'approcha et lut sur une de ces notices que l'honorable
� elder � William Hitch, missionnaire mormon, profitant de sa pr�sence
sur le train n� 48, ferait, de onze heures � midi, dans le car n� 117,
une conf�rence sur le mormonisme --, invitant � l'entendre tous les
gentlemen soucieux de s'instruire touchant les myst�res de la religion
des � Saints des derniers jours �.

� Certes, j'irai �, se dit Passepartout, qui ne connaissait gu�re du
mormonisme que ses usages polygames, base de la soci�t� mormone.

La nouvelle se r�pandit rapidement dans le train, qui emportait une
centaine de voyageurs. Sur ce nombre, trente au plus, all�ch�s par
l'app�t de la conf�rence, occupaient � onze heures les banquettes du
car n� 117. Passepartout figurait au premier rang des fid�les. Ni
son ma�tre ni Fix n'avaient cru devoir se d�ranger.

A l'heure dite, l'elder William Hitch se leva, et d'une voix assez
irrit�e, comme s'il e�t �t� contredit d'avance, il s'�cria :

� Je vous dis, moi, que Joe Smyth est un martyr, que son fr�re Hvram
est un martyr, et que les pers�cutions du gouvernement de l'Union
contre les proph�tes vont faire �galement un martyr de Brigham Young !
Qui oserait soutenir le contraire ? �

Personne ne se hasarda � contredire le missionnaire, dont l'exaltation
contrastait avec sa physionomie naturellement calme. Mais, sans
doute, sa col�re s'expliquait par ce fait que le mormonisme �tait
actuellement soumis � de dures �preuves. Et, en effet, le
gouvernement des �tats-Unis venait, non sans peine, de r�duire ces
fanatiques ind�pendants. Il s'�tait rendu ma�tre de l'Utah, et
l'avait soumis aux lois de l'Union, apr�s avoir emprisonn� Brigham
Young, accus� de r�bellion et de polygamie. Depuis cette �poque, les
disciples du proph�te redoublaient leurs efforts, et, en attendant les
actes, ils r�sistaient par la parole aux pr�tentions du Congr�s.

On le voit, l'elder William Hitch faisait du pros�lytisme jusqu'en
chemin de fer.

Et alors il raconta, en passionnant son r�cit par les �clats de sa
voix et la violence de ses gestes, l'histoire du mormonisme, depuis
les temps bibliques : � comment, dans Isra�l, un proph�te mormon de la
tribu de Joseph publia les annales de la religion nouvelle, et les
l�gua � son fils Morom ; comment, bien des si�cles plus tard, une
traduction de ce pr�cieux livre, �crit en caract�res �gyptiens, fut
faite par Joseph Smyth junior, fermier de l'�tat de Vermont, qui se
r�v�la comme proph�te mystique en 1825 ; comment, enfin, un messager
c�leste lui apparut dans une for�t lumineuse et lui remit les annales
du Seigneur. �

En ce moment, quelques auditeurs, peu int�ress�s par le r�cit
r�trospectif du missionnaire, quitt�rent le wagon ; mais William
Hitch, continuant, raconta � comment Smyth junior, r�unissant son
p�re, ses deux fr�res et quelques disciples, fonda la religion des
Saints des derniers jours --, religion qui, adopt�e non seulement en
Am�rique, mais en Angleterre, en Scandinavie, en Allemagne, compte
parmi ses fid�les des artisans et aussi nombre de gens exer�ant des
professions lib�rales ; comment une colonie fut fond�e dans l'Ohio ;
comment un temple fut �lev� au prix de deux cent mille dollars et une
ville b�tie � Kirkland ; comment Smyth devint un audacieux banquier et
re�ut d'un simple montreur de momies un papyrus contenant un r�cit
�crit de la main d'Abraham et autres c�l�bres �gyptiens. �

Cette narration devenant un peu longue, les rangs des auditeurs
s'�claircirent encore, et le public ne se composa plus que d'une
vingtaine de personnes.

Mais l'elder, sans s'inqui�ter de cette d�sertion, raconta avec d�tail
� comme quoi Joe Smyth fit banqueroute en 1837 ; comme quoi ses
actionnaires ruin�s l'enduisirent de goudron et le roul�rent dans la
plume ; comme quoi on le retrouva, plus honorable et plus honor� que
jamais, quelques ann�es apr�s, � Independance, dans le Missouri, et
chef d'une communaut� florissante, qui ne comptait pas moins de trois
mille disciples, et qu'alors, poursuivi par la haine des gentils, il
dut fuir dans le Far West am�ricain. �

Dix auditeurs �taient encore l�, et parmi eux l'honn�te Passepartout,
qui �coutait de toutes ses oreilles. Ce fut ainsi qu'il apprit �
comment, apr�s de longues pers�cutions, Smyth reparut dans l'Illinois
et fonda en 1839, sur les bords du Mississippi, Nauvoo-la-Belle, dont
la population s'�leva jusqu'� vingt-cinq mille �mes ; comment Smyth en
devint le maire, le juge supr�me et le g�n�ral en chef ; comment, en
1843, il posa sa candidature � la pr�sidence des �tats-Unis, et
comment enfin, attir� dans un guet-apens, � Carthage, il fut jet� en
prison et assassin� par une bande d'hommes masqu�s. �

En ce moment, Passepartout �tait absolument seul dans le wagon, et
l'elder, le regardant en face, le fascinant par ses paroles, lui
rappela que, deux ans apr�s l'assassinat de Smyth, son successeur, le
proph�te inspir�, Brigham Young, abandonnant Nauvoo, vint s'�tablir
aux bords du lac Sal�, et que l�, sur cet admirable territoire, au
milieu de cette contr�e fertile, sur le chemin des �migrants qui
traversaient l'Utah pour se rendre en Californie, la nouvelle colonie,
gr�ce aux principes polygames du mormonisme, prit une extension
�norme.

� Et voil�, ajouta William Hitch, voil� pourquoi la jalousie du
Congr�s s'est exerc�e contre nous ! pourquoi les soldats de l'Union
ont foul� le sol de l'Utah ! pourquoi notre chef, le proph�te Brigham
Young, a �t� emprisonn� au m�pris de toute justice ! C�derons-nous �
la force ? Jamais ! Chass�s du Vermont, chass�s de l'Illinois,
chass�s de l'Ohio, chass�s du Missouri, chass�s de l'Utah, nous
retrouverons encore quelque territoire ind�pendant o� nous planterons
notre tente... Et vous, mon fid�le, ajouta l'elder en fixant sur son
unique auditeur des regards courrouc�s, planterez-vous la v�tre �
l'ombre de notre drapeau ?

-- Non �, r�pondit bravement Passepartout, qui s'enfuit � son tour,
laissant l'�nergum�ne pr�cher dans le d�sert.

Mais pendant cette conf�rence, le train avait march� rapidement, et,
vers midi et demi, il touchait � sa pointe nord-ouest le grand lac
Sal�. De l�, on pouvait embrasser, sur un vaste p�rim�tre, l'aspect
de cette mer int�rieure, qui porte aussi le nom de mer Morte et dans
laquelle se jette un Jourdain d'Am�rique. Lac admirable, encadr� de
belles roches sauvages, � larges assises, encro�t�es de sel blanc,
superbe nappe d'eau qui couvrait autrefois un espace plus consid�rable
; mais avec le temps, ses bords, montant peu � peu, ont r�duit sa
superficie en accroissant sa profondeur.

Le lac Sal�, long de soixante-dix milles environ, large de
trente-cinq, est situ� � trois mille huit cents pieds au-dessus du
niveau de la mer. Bien diff�rent du lac Asphaltite, dont la
d�pression accuse douze cents pieds au-dessous, sa salure est
consid�rable, et ses eaux tiennent en dissolution le quart de leur
poids de mati�re solide. Leur pesanteur sp�cifique est de 1 170,
celle de l'eau distill�e �tant 1 000. Aussi les poissons n'y peuvent
vivre. Ceux qu'y jettent le Jourdain, le Weber et autres creeks, y
p�rissent bient�t ; mais il n'est pas vrai que la densit� de ses eaux
soit telle qu'un homme n'y puisse plonger.

Autour du lac, la campagne �tait admirablement cultiv�e, car les
Mormons s'entendent aux travaux de la terre : des ranchos et des
corrals pour les animaux domestiques, des champs de bl�, de ma�s, de
sorgho, des prairies luxuriantes, partout des haies de rosiers
sauvages, des bouquets d'acacias et d'euphorbes, tel e�t �t� l'aspect
de cette contr�e, six mois plus tard ; mais en ce moment le sol
disparaissait sous une mince couche de neige, qui le poudrait
l�g�rement.

A deux heures, les voyageurs descendaient � la station d'Ogden. Le
train ne devant repartir qu'� six heures, Mr. Fogg, Mrs. Aouda et
leurs deux compagnons avaient donc le temps de se rendre � la Cit� des
Saints par le petit embranchement qui se d�tache de la station
d'Ogden. Deux heures suffisaient � visiter cette ville absolument
am�ricaine et, comme telle, b�tie sur le patron de toutes les villes
de l'Union, vastes �chiquiers � longues lignes froides, avec la �
tristesse lugubre des angles droits �, suivant l'expression de Victor
Hugo. Le fondateur de la Cit� des Saints ne pouvait �chapper � ce
besoin de sym�trie qui distingue les Anglo-Saxons. Dans ce singulier
pays, o� les hommes ne sont certainement pas � la hauteur des
institutions, tout se fait � carr�ment �, les villes, les maisons et
les sottises.

A trois heures, les voyageurs se promenaient donc par les rues de la
cit�, b�tie entre la rive du Jourdain et les premi�res ondulations des
monts Wahsatch. Ils y remarqu�rent peu ou point d'�glises, mais,
comme monuments, la maison du proph�te, la Court-house et l'arsenal ;
puis, des maisons de brique bleu�tre avec v�randas et galeries,
entour�es de jardins, bord�es d'acacias, de palmiers et de caroubiers.
Un mur d'argile et de cailloux, construit en 1853, ceignait la ville.
Dans la principale rue, o� se tient le march�, s'�levaient quelques
h�tels orn�s de pavillons, et entre autres Lake-Salt-house.

Mr. Fogg et ses compagnons ne trouv�rent pas la cit� fort peupl�e.
Les rues �taient presque d�sertes, -- sauf toutefois la partie du
Temple, qu'ils n'atteignirent qu'apr�s avoir travers� plusieurs
quartiers entour�s de palissades. Les femmes �taient assez
nombreuses, ce qui s'explique par la composition singuli�re des
m�nages mormons. Il ne faut pas croire, cependant, que tous les
Mormons soient polygames. On est libre, mais il est bon de remarquer
que ce sont les citoyennes de l'Utah qui tiennent surtout � �tre
�pous�es, car, suivant la religion du pays, le ciel mormon n'admet
point � la possession de ses b�atitudes les c�libataires du sexe
f�minin. Ces pauvres cr�atures ne paraissaient ni ais�es ni
heureuses. Quelques-unes, les plus riches sans doute, portaient une
jaquette de soie noire ouverte � la taille, sous une capuche ou un
ch�le fort modeste. Les autres n'�taient v�tues que d'indienne.

Passepartout, lui, en sa qualit� de gar�on convaincu, ne regardait pas
sans un certain effroi ces Mormones charg�es de faire � plusieurs le
bonheur d'un seul Mormon. Dans son bon sens, c'�tait le mari qu'il
plaignait surtout. Cela lui paraissait terrible d'avoir � guider tant
de dames � la fois au travers des vicissitudes de la vie, � les
conduire ainsi en troupe jusqu'au paradis mormon, avec cette
perspective de les y retrouver pour l'�ternit� en compagnie du
glorieux Smyth, qui devait faire l'ornement de ce lieu de d�lices.
D�cid�ment, il ne se sentait pas la vocation, et il trouvait --
peut-�tre s'abusait-il en ceci -- que les citoyennes de
Great-Lake-City jetaient sur sa personne des regards un peu
inqui�tants.

Tr�s heureusement, son s�jour dans la Cit� des Saints ne devait pas se
prolonger. A quatre heures moins quelques minutes, les voyageurs se
retrouvaient � la gare et reprenaient leur place dans leurs wagons.

Le coup de sifflet se fit entendre ; mais au moment o� les roues
motrices de la locomotive, patinant sur les rails, commen�aient �
imprimer au train quelque vitesse, ces cris : � Arr�tez ! arr�tez ! �
retentirent.

On n'arr�te pas un train en marche. Le gentleman qui prof�rait ces
cris �tait �videmment un Mormon attard�. Il courait � perdre haleine.
Heureusement pour lui, la gare n'avait ni portes ni barri�res. Il
s'�lan�a donc sur la voie, sauta sur le marchepied de la derni�re
voiture, et tomba essouffl� sur une des banquettes du wagon.

Passepartout, qui avait suivi avec �motion les incidents de cette
gymnastique, vint contempler ce retardataire, auquel il s'int�ressa
vivement, quand il apprit que ce citoyen de l'Utah n'avait ainsi pris
la fuite qu'� la suite d'une sc�ne de m�nage.

Lorsque le Mormon eut repris haleine, Passepartout se hasarda � lui
demander poliment combien il avait de femmes, � lui tout seul, -- et �
la fa�on dont il venait de d�camper, il lui en supposait une vingtaine
au moins.

� Une, monsieur ! r�pondit le Mormon en levant les bras au ciel, une,
et c'�tait assez ! �

                                XXVIII
                         --------------------
           DANS LEQUEL PASSEPARTOUT NE PUT PARVENIR A FAIRE
                   ENTENDRE LE LANGAGE DE LA RAISON

Le train, en quittant Great-Salt-Lake et la station d'Ogden, s'�leva
pendant une heure vers le nord, jusqu'� Weber-river, ayant franchi
neuf cents milles environ depuis San Francisco. A partir de ce point,
il reprit la direction de l'est � travers le massif accident� des
monts Wahsatch. C'est dans cette partie du territoire, comprise entre
ces montagnes et les montagnes Rocheuses proprement dites, que les
ing�nieurs am�ricains ont �t� aux prises avec les plus s�rieuses
difficult�s. Aussi, dans ce parcours, la subvention du gouvernement
de l'Union s'est-elle �lev�e � quarante-huit mille dollars par mille,
tandis qu'elle n'�tait que de seize mille dollars en plaine ; mais les
ing�nieurs, ainsi qu'il a �t� dit, n'ont pas violent� la nature, ils
ont rus� avec elle, tournant les difficult�s, et pour atteindre le
grand bassin, un seul tunnel, long de quatorze mille pieds, a �t�
perc� dans tout le parcours du rail-road.

C'�tait au lac Sal� m�me que le trac� avait atteint jusqu'alors sa
plus haute cote d'altitude. Depuis ce point, son profil d�crivait une
courbe tr�s allong�e, s'abaissant vers la vall�e du Bitter-creek, pour
remonter jusqu'au point de partage des eaux entre l'Atlantique et le
Pacifique. Les rios �taient nombreux dans cette montagneuse r�gion.
Il fallut franchir sur des ponceaux le Muddy, le Green et autres.
Passepartout �tait devenu plus impatient � mesure qu'il s'approchait
du but. Mais Fix, � son tour, aurait voulu �tre d�j� sorti de cette
difficile contr�e. Il craignait les retards, il redoutait les
accidents, et �tait plus press� que Phileas Fogg lui-m�me de mettre le
pied sur la terre anglaise !

A dix heures du soir, le train s'arr�tait � la station de
Fort-Bridger, qu'il quitta presque aussit�t, et, vingt milles plus
loin, il entrait dans l'�tat de Wyoming, -- l'ancien Dakota --, en
suivant toute la vall�e du Bitter-creek, d'o� s'�coulent une partie
des eaux qui forment le syst�me hydrographique du Colorado.

Le lendemain, 7 d�cembre, il y eut un quart d'heure d'arr�t � la
station de Green-river. La neige avait tomb� pendant la nuit assez
abondamment, mais, m�l�e � de la pluie, � demi fondue, elle ne pouvait
g�ner la marche du train. Toutefois, ce mauvais temps ne laissa pas
d'inqui�ter Passepartout, car l'accumulation des neiges, en embourbant
les roues des wagons, e�t certainement compromis le voyage.

� Aussi, quelle id�e, se disait-il, mon ma�tre a-t-il eue de voyager
pendant l'hiver ! Ne pouvait-il attendre la belle saison pour
augmenter ses chances ? �

Mais, en ce moment, o� l'honn�te gar�on ne se pr�occupait que de
l'�tat du ciel et de l'abaissement de la temp�rature, Mrs. Aouda
�prouvait des craintes plus vives, qui provenaient d'une tout autre
cause.

En effet, quelques voyageurs �taient descendus de leur wagon, et se
promenaient sur le quai de la gare de Green-river, en attendant le
d�part du train. Or, � travers la vitre, la jeune femme reconnut
parmi eux le colonel Stamp W. Proctor, cet Am�ricain qui s'�tait si
grossi�rement comport� � l'�gard de Phileas Fogg pendant le meeting de
San Francisco. Mrs. Aouda, ne voulant pas �tre vue, se rejeta en
arri�re.

Cette circonstance impressionna vivement la jeune femme. Elle s'�tait
attach�e � l'homme qui, si froidement que ce f�t, lui donnait chaque
jour les marques du plus absolu d�vouement. Elle ne comprenait pas,
sans doute, toute la profondeur du sentiment que lui inspirait son
sauveur, et � ce sentiment elle ne donnait encore que le nom de
reconnaissance, mais, � son insu, il y avait plus que cela. Aussi son
coeur se serra-t-il, quand elle reconnut le grossier personnage auquel
Mr. Fogg voulait t�t ou tard demander raison de sa conduite.
�videmment, c'�tait le hasard seul qui avait amen� dans ce train le
colonel Proctor, mais enfin il y �tait, et il fallait emp�cher � tout
prix que Phileas Fogg aper�ut son adversaire.

Mrs. Aouda, lorsque le train se fut remis en route, profita d'un
moment o� sommeillait Mr. Fogg pour mettre Fix et Passepartout au
courant de la situation.

� Ce Proctor est dans le train ! s'�cria Fix. Eh bien,
rassurez-vous, madame, avant d'avoir affaire au sieur... � Mr. Fogg,
il aura affaire � moi ! Il me semble que, dans tout ceci, c'est
encore moi qui ai re�u les plus graves insultes !

-- Et, de plus, ajouta Passepartout, je me charge de lui, tout colonel
qu'il est.

-- Monsieur Fix, reprit Mrs. Aouda, Mr. Fogg ne laissera � personne
le soin de le venger. Il est homme, il l'a dit, � revenir en Am�rique
pour retrouver cet insulteur. Si donc il aper�oit le colonel Proctor,
nous ne pourrons emp�cher une rencontre, qui peut amener de
d�plorables r�sultats. Il faut donc qu'il ne le voie pas.

-- Vous avez raison, madame, r�pondit Fix, une rencontre pourrait tout
perdre. Vainqueur ou vaincu, Mr. Fogg serait retard�, et...

-- Et, ajouta Passepartout, cela ferait le jeu des gentlemen du
Reform-Club. Dans quatre jours nous serons � New York ! Eh bien, si
pendant quatre jours mon ma�tre ne quitte pas son wagon, on peut
esp�rer que le hasard ne le mettra pas face � face avec ce maudit
Am�ricain, que Dieu confonde ! Or, nous saurons bien l'emp�cher... �

La conversation fut suspendue. Mr. Fogg s'�tait r�veill�, et
regardait la campagne � travers la vitre tachet�e de neige. Mais,
plus tard, et sans �tre entendu de son ma�tre ni de Mrs. Aouda,
Passepartout dit � l'inspecteur de police :

� Est-ce que vraiment vous vous battriez pour lui ?

-- Je ferai tout pour le ramener vivant en Europe ! � r�pondit
simplement Fix, d'un ton qui marquait une implacable volont�.

Passepartout sentit comme un frisson lui courir par le corps, mais ses
convictions � l'endroit de son ma�tre ne faiblirent pas.

Et maintenant, y avait-il un moyen quelconque de retenir Mr. Fogg
dans ce compartiment pour pr�venir toute rencontre entre le colonel et
lui ? Cela ne pouvait �tre difficile, le gentleman �tant d'un naturel
peu remuant et peu curieux. En tout cas, l'inspecteur de police crut
avoir trouv� ce moyen, car, quelques instants plus tard, il disait �
Phileas Fogg :

� Ce sont de longues et lentes heures, monsieur, que celles que l'on
passe ainsi en chemin de fer.

-- En effet, r�pondit le gentleman, mais elles passent.

-- A bord des paquebots, reprit l'inspecteur, vous aviez l'habitude de
faire votre whist ?

-- Oui, r�pondit Phileas Fogg, mais ici ce serait difficile. Je n'ai
ni cartes ni partenaires.

-- Oh ! les cartes, nous trouverons bien � les acheter. On vend de
tout dans les wagons am�ricains. Quant aux partenaires, si, par
hasard, madame...

-- Certainement, monsieur, r�pondit vivement la jeune femme, je
connais le whist. Cela fait partie de l'�ducation anglaise.

-- Et moi, reprit Fix, j'ai quelques pr�tentions � bien jouer ce jeu.
Or, � nous trois et un mort...

-- Comme il vous plaira, monsieur �, r�pondit Phileas Fogg, enchant�
de reprendre son jeu favori --, m�me en chemin de fer.

Passepartout fut d�p�ch� � la recherche du steward, et il revint
bient�t avec deux jeux complets, des fiches, des jetons et une
tablette recouverte de drap. Rien ne manquait. Le jeu commen�a.
Mrs. Aouda savait tr�s suffisamment le whist, et elle re�ut m�me
quelques compliments du s�v�re Phileas Fogg. Quant � l'inspecteur, il
�tait tout simplement de premi�re force, et digne de tenir t�te au
gentleman.

� Maintenant, se dit Passepartout � lui-m�me, nous le tenons. Il ne
bougera plus ! �

A onze heures du matin, le train avait atteint le point de partage des
eaux des deux oc�ans. C'�tait � Passe-Bridger, � une hauteur de sept
mille cinq cent vingt-quatre pieds anglais au-dessus du niveau de la
mer, un des plus hauts points touch�s par le profil du trac� dans ce
passage � travers les montagnes Rocheuses. Apr�s deux cents milles
environ, les voyageurs se trouveraient enfin sur ces longues plaines
qui s'�tendent jusqu'� l'Atlantique, et que la nature rendait si
propices � l'�tablissement d'une voie ferr�e.

Sur le versant du bassin atlantique se d�veloppaient d�j� les premiers
rios, affluents ou sous-affluents de North-Platte-river. Tout
l'horizon du nord et de l'est �tait couvert par cette immense courtine
semi-circulaire, qui forme la portion septentrionale des
Rocky-Mountains, domin�e par le pic de Laramie. Entre cette courbure
et la ligne de fer s'�tendaient de vastes plaines, largement arros�es.
Sur la droite du rail-road s'�tageaient les premi�res rampes du massif
montagneux qui s'arrondit au sud jusqu'aux sources de la rivi�re de
l'Arkansas, l'un des grands tributaires du Missouri.

A midi et demi, les voyageurs entrevoyaient un instant le fort
Halleck, qui commande cette contr�e. Encore quelques heures, et la
travers�e des montagnes Rocheuses serait accomplie. On pouvait donc
esp�rer qu'aucun accident ne signalerait le passage du train � travers
cette difficile r�gion. La neige avait cess� de tomber. Le temps se
mettait au froid sec. De grands oiseaux, effray�s par la locomotive,
s'enfuyaient au loin. Aucun fauve, ours ou loup, ne se montrait sur
la plaine. C'�tait le d�sert dans son immense nudit�.

Apr�s un d�jeuner assez confortable, servi dans le wagon m�me, Mr.
Fogg et ses partenaires venaient de reprendre leur interminable whist,
quand de violents coups de sifflet se firent entendre. Le train
s'arr�ta.

Passepartout mit la t�te � la porti�re et ne vit rien qui motiv�t cet
arr�t. Aucune station n'�tait en vue.

Mrs. Aouda et Fix purent craindre un instant que Mr. Fogg ne songe�t
� descendre sur la voie. Mais le gentleman se contenta de dire � son
domestique :

� Voyez donc ce que c'est. �

Passepartout s'�lan�a hors du wagon. Une quarantaine de voyageurs
avaient d�j� quitt� leurs places, et parmi eux le colonel Stamp W.
Proctor.

Le train �tait arr�t� devant un signal tourn� au rouge qui fermait la
voie. Le m�canicien et le conducteur, �tant descendus, discutaient
assez vivement avec un garde-voie, que le chef de gare de
Medicine-Bow, la station prochaine, avait envoy� au-devant du train.
Des voyageurs s'�taient approch�s et prenaient part � la discussion,
-- entre autres le susdit colonel Proctor, avec son verbe haut et ses
gestes imp�rieux.

Passepartout, ayant rejoint le groupe, entendit le garde-voie qui
disait :

� Non ! il n'y a pas moyen de passer ! Le pont de Medicine-Bow est
�branl� et ne supporterait pas le poids du train. �

Ce pont, dont il �tait question, �tait un pont suspendu, jet� sur un
rapide, � un mille de l'endroit o� le convoi s'�tait arr�t�. Au dire
du garde-voie, il mena�ait ruine, plusieurs des fils �taient rompus,
et il �tait impossible d'en risquer le passage. Le garde-voie
n'exag�rait donc en aucune fa�on en affirmant qu'on ne pouvait passer.
Et d'ailleurs, avec les habitudes d'insouciance des Am�ricains, on
peut dire que, quand ils se mettent � �tre prudents, il y aurait folie
� ne pas l'�tre.

Passepartout, n'osant aller pr�venir son ma�tre, �coutait, les dents
serr�es, immobile comme une statue.

� Ah ��! s'�cria le colonel Proctor, nous n'allons pas, j'imagine,
rester ici � prendre racine dans la neige !

-- Colonel, r�pondit le conducteur, on a t�l�graphi� � la station
d'Omaha pour demander un train, mais il n'est pas probable qu'il
arrive � Medicine-Bow avant six heures.

-- Six heures ! s'�cria Passepartout.

-- Sans doute, r�pondit le conducteur. D'ailleurs, ce temps nous sera
n�cessaire pour gagner � pied la station.

-- A pied ! s'�cri�rent tous les voyageurs.

-- Mais � quelle distance est donc cette station ? demanda l'un d'eux
au conducteur.

-- A douze milles, de l'autre c�t� de la rivi�re.

-- Douze milles dans la neige ! � s'�cria Stamp W. Proctor.

Le colonel lan�a une bord�e de jurons, s'en prenant � la compagnie,
s'en prenant au conducteur, et Passepartout, furieux, n'�tait pas loin
de faire chorus avec lui. Il y avait l� un obstacle mat�riel contre
lequel �choueraient, cette fois, toutes les bank-notes de son ma�tre.

Au surplus, le d�sappointement �tait g�n�ral parmi les voyageurs, qui,
sans compter le retard, se voyaient oblig�s � faire une quinzaine de
milles � travers la plaine couverte de neige. Aussi �tait-ce un
brouhaha, des exclamations, des vocif�rations, qui auraient
certainement attir� l'attention de Phileas Fogg, si ce gentleman n'e�t
�t� absorb� par son jeu.

Cependant Passepartout se trouvait dans la n�cessit� de le pr�venir,
et, la t�te basse, il se dirigeait vers le wagon, quand le m�canicien
du train -- un vrai Yankee, nomm� Forster --, �levant la voix, dit :

� Messieurs, il y aurait peut-�tre moyen de passer.

-- Sur le pont ? r�pondit un voyageur.

-- Sur le pont.

-- Avec notre train ? demanda le colonel.

-- Avec notre train. �

Passepartout s'�tait arr�t�, et d�vorait les paroles du m�canicien.

� Mais le pont menace ruine ! reprit le conducteur.

-- N'importe, r�pondit Forster. Je crois qu'en lan�ant le train avec
son maximum de vitesse, on aurait quelques chances de passer.

-- Diable ! � fit Passepartout.

Mais un certain nombre de voyageurs avaient �t� imm�diatement s�duits
par la proposition. Elle plaisait particuli�rement au colonel
Proctor. Ce cerveau br�l� trouvait la chose tr�s faisable. Il
rappela m�me que des ing�nieurs avaient eu l'id�e de passer des
rivi�res � sans pont � avec des trains rigides lanc�s � toute vitesse,
etc. Et, en fin de compte, tous les int�ress�s dans la question se
rang�rent � l'avis du m�canicien.

� Nous avons cinquante chances pour passer, disait l'un.

-- Soixante, disait l'autre.

-- Quatre-vingts !... quatre-vingt-dix sur cent ! �

Passepartout �tait ahuri, quoiqu'il f�t pr�t � tout tenter pour op�rer
le passage du Medicine-creek, mais la tentative lui semblait un peu
trop � am�ricaine �.

� D'ailleurs, pensa-t-il, il y a une chose bien plus simple � faire,
et ces gens-l� n'y songent m�me pas !... �

� Monsieur, dit-il � un des voyageurs, le moyen propos� par le
m�canicien me para�t un peu hasard�, mais...

-- Quatre-vingts chances ! r�pondit le voyageur, qui lui tourna le
dos.

-- Je sais bien, r�pondit Passepartout en s'adressant � un autre
gentleman, mais une simple r�flexion...

-- Pas de r�flexion, c'est inutile ! r�pondit l'Am�ricain interpell�
en haussant les �paules, puisque le m�canicien assure qu'on passera !

-- Sans doute, reprit Passepartout, on passera, mais il serait
peut-�tre plus prudent...

-- Quoi ! prudent ! s'�cria le colonel Proctor, que ce mot, entendu
par hasard, fit bondir. A grande vitesse, on vous dit !
Comprenez-vous ? A grande vitesse !

-- Je sais... je comprends..., r�p�tait Passepartout, auquel personne
ne laissait achever sa phrase, mais il serait, sinon plus prudent,
puisque le mot vous choque, du moins plus naturel...

-- Qui ? que ? quoi ? Qu'a-t-il donc celui-l� avec son
naturel ?... � s'�cria-t-on de toutes parts.

Le pauvre gar�on ne savait plus de qui se faire entendre.

� Est-ce que vous avez peur ? lui demanda le colonel Proctor.

-- Moi, peur ! s'�cria Passepartout. Eh bien, soit ! Je montrerai �
ces gens-l� qu'un Fran�ais peut �tre aussi am�ricain qu'eux !

-- En voiture ! en voiture ! criait le conducteur.

-- Oui ! en voiture, r�p�tait Passepartout, en voiture ! Et tout de
suite ! Mais on ne m'emp�chera pas de penser qu'il e�t �t� plus
naturel de nous faire d'abord passer � pied sur ce pont, nous autres
voyageurs, puis le train ensuite !... �

Mais personne n'entendit cette sage r�flexion, et personne n'e�t voulu
en reconna�tre la justesse.

Les voyageurs �taient r�int�gr�s dans leur wagon. Passepartout reprit
sa place, sans rien dire de ce qui s'�tait pass�. Les joueurs �taient
tout entiers � leur whist.

La locomotive siffla vigoureusement. Le m�canicien, renversant la
vapeur, ramena son train en arri�re pendant pr�s d'un mille --,
reculant comme un sauteur qui veut prendre son �lan.

Puis, � un second coup de sifflet, la marche en avant recommen�a :
elle s'acc�l�ra ; bient�t la vitesse devint effroyable ; on
n'entendait plus qu'un seul hennissement sortant de la locomotive ;
les pistons battaient vingt coups � la seconde ; les essieux des roues
fumaient dans les bo�tes � graisse. On sentait, pour ainsi dire, que
le train tout entier, marchant avec une rapidit� de cent milles �
l'heure, ne pesait plus sur les rails. La vitesse mangeait la
pesanteur.

Et l'on passa ! Et ce fut comme un �clair. On ne vit rien du pont.
Le convoi sauta, on peut le dire, d'une rive � l'autre, et le
m�canicien ne parvint � arr�ter sa machine emport�e qu'� cinq milles
au-del� de la station.

Mais � peine le train avait-il franchi la rivi�re, que le pont,
d�finitivement ruin�, s'ab�mait avec fracas dans le rapide de
Medicine-Bow.

                                 XXIX
                         --------------------
        O� IL SERA FAIT LE R�CIT D'INCIDENTS DIVERS QUI NE SE
            RENCONTRENT QUE SUR LES RAIL-ROADS DE L'UNION

Le soir m�me, le train poursuivait sa route sans obstacles, d�passait
le fort Sauders, franchissait la passe de Cheyenne et arrivait � la
passe d'Evans. En cet endroit, le rail-road atteignait le plus haut
point du parcours, soit huit mille quatre-vingt-onze pieds au-dessus
du niveau de l'oc�an. Les voyageurs n'avaient plus qu'� descendre
jusqu'� l'Atlantique sur ces plaines sans limites, nivel�es par la
nature.

L� se trouvait sur le � grand trunk � l'embranchement de Denver-city,
la principale ville du Colorado. Ce territoire est riche en mines
d'or et d'argent, et plus de cinquante mille habitants y ont d�j� fix�
leur demeure.

A ce moment, treize cent quatre-vingt-deux milles avaient �t� faits
depuis San Francisco, en trois jours et trois nuits. Quatre nuits et
quatre jours, selon toute pr�vision, devaient suffire pour atteindre
New York. Phileas Fogg se maintenait donc dans les d�lais
r�glementaires.

Pendant la nuit, on laissa sur la gauche le camp Walbah. Le
Lodge-pole-creek courait parall�lement � la voie, en suivant la
fronti�re rectiligne commune aux �tats du Wyoming et du Colorado. A
onze heures, on entrait dans le Nebraska, on passait pr�s du Sedgwick,
et l'on touchait � Julesburgh, plac� sur la branche sud de
Platte-river.

C'est � ce point que se fit l'inauguration de l'Union Pacific Road, le
23 octobre 1867, et dont l'ing�nieur en chef fut le g�n�ral J. M.
Dodge. L� s'arr�t�rent les deux puissantes locomotives, remorquant
les neuf wagons des invit�s, au nombre desquels figurait le
vice-pr�sident, Mr. Thomas C. Durant ; l� retentirent les
acclamations ; l�, les Sioux et les Pawnies donn�rent le spectacle
d'une petite guerre indienne ; l�, les feux d'artifice �clat�rent ;
l�, enfin, se publia, au moyen d'une imprimerie portative, le premier
num�ro du journal _Railway Pioneer_. Ainsi fut c�l�br�e
l'inauguration de ce grand chemin de fer, instrument de progr�s et de
civilisation, jet� � travers le d�sert et destin� � relier entre elles
des villes et des cit�s qui n'existaient pas encore. Le sifflet de la
locomotive, plus puissant que la lyre d'Amphion, allait bient�t les
faire surgir du sol am�ricain.

A huit heures du matin, le fort Mac-Pherson �tait laiss� en arri�re.
Trois cent cinquante-sept milles s�parent ce point d'Omaha. La voie
ferr�e suivait, sur sa rive gauche, les capricieuses sinuosit�s de la
branche sud de Platte-river. A neuf heures, on arrivait �
l'importante ville de North-Platte, b�tie entre ces deux bras du grand
cours d'eau, qui se rejoignent autour d'elle pour ne plus former
qu'une seule art�re --, affluent consid�rable dont les eaux se
confondent avec celles du Missouri, un peu au-dessus d'Omaha.

Le cent-uni�me m�ridien �tait franchi.

Mr. Fogg et ses partenaires avaient repris leur jeu. Aucun d'eux ne
se plaignait de la longueur de la route --, pas m�me le mort. Fix
avait commenc� par gagner quelques guin�es, qu'il �tait en train de
reperdre, mais il ne se montrait pas moins passionn� que Mr. Fogg.
Pendant cette matin�e, la chance favorisa singuli�rement ce gentleman.
Les atouts et les honneurs pleuvaient dans ses mains. A un certain
moment, apr�s avoir combin� un coup audacieux, il se pr�parait � jouer
pique, quand, derri�re la banquette, une voix se fit entendre, qui
disait :

� Moi, je jouerais carreau... �

Mr. Fogg, Mrs. Aouda, Fix lev�rent la t�te. Le colonel Proctor
�tait pr�s d'eux.

Stamp W. Proctor et Phileas Fogg se reconnurent aussit�t.

� Ah ! c'est vous, monsieur l'Anglais, s'�cria le colonel, c'est vous
qui voulez jouer pique !

-- Et qui le joue, r�pondit froidement Phileas Fogg, en abattant un
dix de cette couleur.

-- Eh bien, il me pla�t que ce soit carreau �, r�pliqua le colonel
Proctor d'une voix irrit�e.

Et il fit un geste pour saisir la carte jou�e, en ajoutant :

� Vous n'entendez rien � ce jeu.

-- Peut-�tre serai-je plus habile � un autre, dit Phileas Fogg, qui se
leva.

-- Il ne tient qu'� vous d'en essayer, fils de John Bull ! � r�pliqua
le grossier personnage.

Mrs. Aouda �tait devenue p�le. Tout son sang lui refluait au coeur.
Elle avait saisi le bras de Phileas Fogg, qui la repoussa doucement.
Passepartout �tait pr�t � se jeter sur l'Am�ricain, qui regardait son
adversaire de l'air le plus insultant. Mais Fix s'�tait lev�, et,
allant au colonel Proctor, il lui dit :

� Vous oubliez que c'est moi � qui vous avez affaire, monsieur, moi
que vous avez, non seulement injuri�, mais frapp� !

-- Monsieur Fix, dit Mr. Fogg, je vous demande pardon, mais ceci me
regarde seul. En pr�tendant que j'avais tort de jouer pique, le
colonel m'a fait une nouvelle injure, et il m'en rendra raison.

-- Quand vous voudrez, et o� vous voudrez, r�pondit l'Am�ricain, et �
l'arme qu'il vous plaira ! �

Mrs. Aouda essaya vainement de retenir Mr. Fogg. L'inspecteur tenta
inutilement de reprendre la querelle � son compte. Passepartout
voulait jeter le colonel par la porti�re, mais un signe de son ma�tre
l'arr�ta. Phileas Fogg quitta le wagon, et l'Am�ricain le suivit sur
la passerelle.

� Monsieur, dit Mr. Fogg � son adversaire, je suis fort press� de
retourner en Europe, et un retard quelconque pr�judicierait beaucoup �
mes int�r�ts.

-- Eh bien ! qu'est-ce que cela me fait ? r�pondit le colonel
Proctor.

-- Monsieur, reprit tr�s poliment Mr. Fogg, apr�s notre rencontre �
San Francisco, j'avais form� le projet de venir vous retrouver en
Am�rique, d�s que j'aurais termin� les affaires qui m'appellent sur
l'ancien continent.

-- Vraiment !

-- Voulez-vous me donner rendez-vous dans six mois ?

-- Pourquoi pas dans six ans ?

-- Je dis six mois, r�pondit Mr. Fogg, et je serai exact au
rendez-vous.

-- Des d�faites, tout cela ! s'�cria Stamp W. Proctor. Tout de suite
ou pas.

-- Soit, r�pondit Mr. Fogg. Vous allez � New York ?

-- Non.

-- A Chicago ?

-- Non.

-- A Omaha ?

-- Peu vous importe ! Connaissez-vous Plum-Creek ?

-- Non, r�pondit Mr. Fogg.

-- C'est la station prochaine. Le train y sera dans une heure. Il y
stationnera dix minutes. En dix minutes, on peut �changer quelques
coups de revolver.

-- Soit, r�pondit Mr. Fogg. Je m'arr�terai � Plum-Creek.

-- Et je crois m�me que vous y resterez ! ajouta l'Am�ricain avec une
insolence sans pareille.

-- Qui sait, monsieur ? � r�pondit Mr. Fogg, et il rentra dans son
wagon, aussi froid que d'habitude.

L�, le gentleman commen�a par rassurer Mrs. Aouda, lui disant que les
fanfarons n'�taient jamais � craindre. Puis il pria Fix de lui servir
de t�moin dans la rencontre qui allait avoir lieu. Fix ne pouvait
refuser, et Phileas Fogg reprit tranquillement son jeu interrompu, en
jouant pique avec un calme parfait.

A onze heures, le sifflet de la locomotive annon�a l'approche de la
station de Plum-Creek. Mr. Fogg se leva, et, suivi de Fix, il se
rendit sur la passerelle. Passepartout l'accompagnait, portant une
paire de revolvers. Mrs. Aouda �tait rest�e dans le wagon, p�le
comme une morte.

En ce moment, la porte de l'autre wagon s'ouvrit, et le colonel
Proctor apparut �galement sur la passerelle, suivi de son t�moin, un
Yankee de sa trempe. Mais � l'instant o� les deux adversaires
allaient descendre sur la voie, le conducteur accourut et leur cria :

� On ne descend pas, messieurs.

-- Et pourquoi ? demanda le colonel.

-- Nous avons vingt minutes de retard, et le train ne s'arr�te pas.

-- Mais je dois me battre avec monsieur.

-- Je le regrette, r�pondit l'employ�, mais nous repartons
imm�diatement. Voici la cloche qui sonne ! �

La cloche sonnait, en effet, et le train se remit en route.

� Je suis vraiment d�sol�, messieurs, dit alors le conducteur. En
toute autre circonstance, j'aurai pu vous obliger. Mais, apr�s tout,
puisque vous n'avez pas eu le temps de vous battre ici, qui vous
emp�che de vous battre en route ?

-- Cela ne conviendra peut-�tre pas � monsieur ! dit le colonel
Proctor d'un air goguenard.

-- Cela me convient parfaitement �, r�pondit Phileas Fogg.

� Allons, d�cid�ment, nous sommes en Am�rique ! pensa Passepartout,
et le conducteur de train est un gentleman du meilleur monde ! �

Et ce disant il suivit son ma�tre.

Les deux adversaires, leurs t�moins, pr�c�d�s du conducteur, se
rendirent, en passant d'un wagon � l'autre, � l'arri�re du train. Le
dernier wagon n'�tait occup� que par une dizaine de voyageurs. Le
conducteur leur demanda s'ils voulaient bien, pour quelques instants,
laisser la place libre � deux gentlemen qui avaient une affaire
d'honneur � vider.

Comment donc ! Mais les voyageurs �taient trop heureux de pouvoir
�tre agr�ables aux deux gentlemen, et ils se retir�rent sur les
passerelles.

Ce wagon, long d'une cinquantaine de pieds, se pr�tait tr�s
convenablement � la circonstance. Les deux adversaires pouvaient
marcher l'un sur l'autre entre les banquettes et s'arquebuser � leur
aise. Jamais duel ne fut plus facile � r�gler. Mr. Fogg et le
colonel Proctor, munis chacun de deux revolvers � six coups, entr�rent
dans le wagon. Leurs t�moins, rest�s en dehors, les y enferm�rent.
Au premier coup de sifflet de la locomotive, ils devaient commencer le
feu... Puis, apr�s un laps de deux minutes, on retirerait du wagon ce
qui resterait des deux gentlemen.

Rien de plus simple en v�rit�. C'�tait m�me si simple, que Fix et
Passepartout sentaient leur coeur battre � se briser.

On attendait donc le coup de sifflet convenu, quand soudain des cris
sauvages retentirent. Des d�tonations les accompagn�rent, mais elles
ne venaient point du wagon r�serv� aux duellistes. Ces d�tonations se
prolongeaient, au contraire, jusqu'� l'avant et sur toute la ligne du
train. Des cris de frayeur se faisaient entendre � l'int�rieur du
convoi.

Le colonel Proctor et Mr. Fogg, revolver au poing, sortirent aussit�t
du wagon et se pr�cipit�rent vers l'avant, o� retentissaient plus
bruyamment les d�tonations et les cris.

Ils avaient compris que le train �tait attaqu� par une bande de Sioux.

Ces hardis Indiens n'en �taient pas � leur coup d'essai, et plus d'une
fois d�j� ils avaient arr�t� les convois. Suivant leur habitude, sans
attendre l'arr�t du train, s'�lan�ant sur les marchepieds au nombre
d'une centaine, ils avaient escalad� les wagons comme fait un clown
d'un cheval au galop.

Ces Sioux �taient munis de fusils. De l� les d�tonations auxquelles
les voyageurs, presque tous arm�s, ripostaient par des coups de
revolver. Tout d'abord, les Indiens s'�taient pr�cipit�s sur la
machine. Le m�canicien et le chauffeur avaient �t� � demi assomm�s �
coups de casse-t�te. Un chef sioux, voulant arr�ter le train, mais ne
sachant pas manoeuvrer la manette du r�gulateur, avait largement
ouvert l'introduction de la vapeur au lieu de la fermer, et la
locomotive, emport�e, courait avec une vitesse effroyable.

En m�me temps, les Sioux avaient envahi les wagons, ils couraient
comme des singes en fureur sur les imp�riales, ils enfon�aient les
porti�res et luttaient corps � corps avec les voyageurs. Hors du
wagon de bagages, forc� et pill�, les colis �taient pr�cipit�s sur la
voie. Cris et coups de feu ne discontinuaient pas.

Cependant les voyageurs se d�fendaient avec courage. Certains wagons,
barricad�s, soutenaient un si�ge, comme de v�ritables forts ambulants,
emport�s avec une rapidit� de cent milles � l'heure.

D�s le d�but de l'attaque, Mrs. Aouda s'�tait courageusement
comport�e. Le revolver � la main, elle se d�fendait h�ro�quement,
tirant � travers les vitres bris�es, lorsque quelque sauvage se
pr�sentait � elle. Une vingtaine de Sioux, frapp�s � mort, �taient
tomb�s sur la voie, et les roues des wagons �crasaient comme des vers
ceux d'entre eux qui glissaient sur les rails du haut des passerelles.

Plusieurs voyageurs, gri�vement atteints par les balles ou les
casse-t�te, gisaient sur les banquettes.

Cependant il fallait en finir. Cette lutte durait d�j� depuis dix
minutes, et ne pouvait que se terminer � l'avantage des Sioux, si le
train ne s'arr�tait pas. En effet, la station du fort Kearney n'�tait
pas � deux milles de distance. L� se trouvait un poste am�ricain ;
mais ce poste pass�, entre le fort Kearney et la station suivante les
Sioux seraient les ma�tres du train.

Le conducteur se battait aux c�t�s de Mr. Fogg, quand une balle le
renversa. En tombant, cet homme s'�cria :

� Nous sommes perdus, si le train ne s'arr�te pas avant cinq minutes !

-- Il s'arr�tera ! dit Phileas Fogg, qui voulut s'�lancer hors du
wagon.

-- Restez, monsieur, lui cria Passepartout. Cela me regarde ! �

Phileas Fogg n'eut pas le temps d'arr�ter ce courageux gar�on, qui,
ouvrant une porti�re sans �tre vu des Indiens, parvint � se glisser
sous le wagon. Et alors, tandis que la lutte continuait, pendant que
les balles se croisaient au-dessus de sa t�te, retrouvant son agilit�,
sa souplesse de clown, se faufilant sous les wagons, s'accrochant aux
cha�nes, s'aidant du levier des freins et des longerons des ch�ssis,
rampant d'une voiture � l'autre avec une adresse merveilleuse, il
gagna ainsi l'avant du train. Il n'avait pas �t� vu, il n'avait pu
l'�tre.

L�, suspendu d'une main entre le wagon des bagages et le tender, de
l'autre il d�crocha les cha�nes de s�ret� ; mais par suite de la
traction op�r�e, il n'aurait jamais pu parvenir � d�visser la barre
d'attelage, si une secousse que la machine �prouva n'e�t fait sauter
cette barre, et le train, d�tach�, resta peu � peu en arri�re, tandis
que la locomotive s'enfuyait avec une nouvelle vitesse.

Emport� par la force acquise, le train roula encore pendant quelques
minutes, mais les freins furent manoeuvr�s � l'int�rieur des wagons,
et le convoi s'arr�ta enfin, � moins de cent pas de la station de
Kearney.

L�, les soldats du fort, attir�s par les coups de feu, accoururent en
h�te. Les Sioux ne les avaient pas attendus, et, avant l'arr�t
complet du train, toute la bande avait d�camp�.

Mais quand les voyageurs se compt�rent sur le quai de la station, ils
reconnurent que plusieurs manquaient � l'appel, et entre autres le
courageux Fran�ais dont le d�vouement venait de les sauver.

                                 XXX
                         --------------------
       DANS LEQUEL PHILEAS FOGG FAIT TOUT SIMPLEMENT SON DEVOIR

Trois voyageurs, Passepartout compris, avaient disparu. Avaient-ils
�t� tu�s dans la lutte ? Etaient-ils prisonniers des Sioux ? On ne
pouvait encore le savoir.

Les bless�s �taient assez nombreux, mais on reconnut qu'aucun n'�tait
atteint mortellement. Un d�s plus gri�vement frapp�, c'�tait le
colonel Proctor, qui s'�tait bravement battu, et qu'une balle � l'aine
avait renvers�. Il fut transport� � la gare avec d'autres voyageurs,
dont l'�tat r�clamait des soins imm�diats.

Mrs. Aouda �tait sauve. Phileas Fogg, qui ne s'�tait pas �pargn�,
n'avait pas une �gratignure. Fix �tait bless� au bras, blessure sans
importance. Mais Passepartout manquait, et des larmes coulaient des
yeux de la jeune femme.

Cependant tous les voyageurs avaient quitt� le train. Les roues des
wagons �taient tach�es de sang. Aux moyeux et aux rayons pendaient
d'informes lambeaux de chair. On voyait � perte de vue sur la plaine
blanche de longues tra�n�es rouges. Les derniers Indiens
disparaissaient alors dans le sud, du c�t� de Republican-river.

Mr. Fogg, les bras crois�s, restait immobile. Il avait une grave
d�cision � prendre. Mrs. Aouda, pr�s de lui, le regardait sans
prononcer une parole... Il comprit ce regard. Si son serviteur �tait
prisonnier, ne devait-il pas tout risquer pour l'arracher aux
Indiens ?...

� Je le retrouverai mort ou vivant, dit-il simplement � Mrs. Aouda.

-- Ah ! monsieur... monsieur Fogg ! s'�cria la jeune femme, en
saisissant les mains de son compagnon qu'elle couvrit de larmes.

-- Vivant ! ajouta Mr. Fogg, si nous ne perdons pas une minute ! �

Par cette r�solution, Phileas Fogg se sacrifiait tout entier. Il
venait de prononcer sa ruine. Un seul jour de retard lui faisait
manquer le paquebot � New York. Son pari �tait irr�vocablement perdu.
Mais devant cette pens�e : � C'est mon devoir ! � il n'avait pas
h�sit�.

Le capitaine commandant le fort Kearney �tait l�. Ses soldats -- une
centaine d'hommes environ -- s'�taient mis sur la d�fensive pour le
cas o� les Sioux auraient dirig� une attaque directe contre la gare.

� Monsieur, dit Mr. Fogg au capitaine, trois voyageurs ont disparu.

-- Morts ? demanda le capitaine.

-- Morts ou prisonniers, r�pondit Phileas Fogg. L� est une
incertitude qu'il faut faire cesser. Votre intention est-elle de
poursuivre les Sioux ?

-- Cela est grave, monsieur, dit le capitaine. Ces Indiens peuvent
fuir jusqu'au-del� de l'Arkansas ! Je ne saurais abandonner le fort
qui m'est confi�.

-- Monsieur, reprit Phileas Fogg, il s'agit de la vie de trois hommes.

-- Sans doute... mais puis-je risquer la vie de cinquante pour en
sauver trois ?

-- Je ne sais si vous le pouvez, monsieur, mais vous le devez.

-- Monsieur, r�pondit le capitaine, personne ici n'a � m'apprendre
quel est mon devoir.

-- Soit, dit froidement Phileas Fogg. J'irai seul !

-- Vous, monsieur ! s'�cria Fix, qui s'�tait approch�, aller seul �
la poursuite des Indiens !

-- Voulez-vous donc que je laisse p�rir ce malheureux, � qui tout ce
qui est vivant ici doit la vie ? J'irai.

-- Eh bien, non, vous n'irez pas seul ! s'�cria le capitaine, �mu
malgr� lui. Non ! Vous �tes un brave coeur !... Trente hommes de
bonne volont� ! � ajouta-t-il en se tournant vers ses soldats.

Toute la compagnie s'avan�a en masse. Le capitaine n'eut qu'� choisir
parmi ces braves gens. Trente soldats furent d�sign�s, et un vieux
sergent se mit � leur t�te.

� Merci, capitaine ! dit Mr. Fogg.

-- Vous me permettrez de vous accompagner ? demanda Fix au gentleman.

-- Vous ferez comme il vous plaira, monsieur, lui r�pondit Phileas
Fogg. Mais si vous voulez me rendre service, vous resterez pr�s de
Mrs. Aouda. Au cas o� il m'arriverait malheur... �

Une p�leur subite envahit la figure de l'inspecteur de police. Se
s�parer de l'homme qu'il avait suivi pas � pas et avec tant de
persistance ! Le laisser s'aventurer ainsi dans ce d�sert ! Fix
regarda attentivement le gentleman, et, quoi qu'il en e�t, malgr� ses
pr�ventions, en d�pit du combat qui se livrait en lui, il baissa les
yeux devant ce regard calme et franc.

� Je resterai �, dit-il.

Quelques instants apr�s, Mr. Fogg avait serr� la main de la jeune
femme ; puis, apr�s lui avoir remis son pr�cieux sac de voyage, il
partait avec le sergent et sa petite troupe.

Mais avant de partir, il avait dit aux soldats :

� Mes amis, il y a mille livres pour vous si nous sauvons les
prisonniers ! �

Il �tait alors midi et quelques minutes.

Mrs. Aouda s'�tait retir�e dans une chambre de la gare, et l�, seule,
elle attendait, songeant � Phileas Fogg, � cette g�n�rosit� simple et
grande, � ce tranquille courage. Mr. Fogg avait sacrifi� sa fortune,
et maintenant il jouait sa vie, tout cela sans h�sitation, par devoir,
sans phrases. Phileas Fogg �tait un h�ros � ses yeux.

L'inspecteur Fix, lui, ne pensait pas ainsi, et il ne pouvait contenir
son agitation. Il se promenait f�brilement sur le quai de la gare.
Un moment subjugu�, il redevenait lui-m�me. Fogg parti, il comprenait
la sottise qu'il avait faite de le laisser partir. Quoi ! cet homme
qu'il venait de suivre autour du monde, il avait consenti � s'en
s�parer ! Sa nature reprenait le dessus, il s'incriminait, il
s'accusait, il se traitait comme s'il e�t �t� le directeur de la
police m�tropolitaine, admonestant un agent pris en flagrant d�lit de
na�vet�.

� J'ai �t� inepte ! pensait-il. L'autre lui aura appris qui
j'�tais ! Il est parti, il ne reviendra pas ! O� le reprendre
maintenant ? Mais comment ai-je pu me laisser fasciner ainsi, moi,
Fix, moi, qui ai en poche son ordre d'arrestation ! D�cid�ment je ne
suis qu'une b�te ! �

Ainsi raisonnait l'inspecteur de police, tandis que les heures
s'�coulaient si lentement � son gr�. Il ne savait que faire.
Quelquefois, il avait envie de tout dire � Mrs. Aouda. Mais il
comprenait comment il serait re�u par la jeune femme. Quel parti
prendre ? Il �tait tent� de s'en aller � travers les longues plaines
blanches, � la poursuite de ce Fogg ! Il ne lui semblait pas
impossible de le retrouver. Les pas du d�tachement �taient encore
imprim�s sur la neige !... Mais bient�t, sous une couche nouvelle,
toute empreinte s'effa�a.

Alors le d�couragement prit Fix. Il �prouva comme une insurmontable
envie d'abandonner la partie. Or, pr�cis�ment, cette occasion de
quitter la station de Kearney et de poursuivre ce voyage, si f�cond en
d�convenues, lui fut offerte.

En effet, vers deux heures apr�s midi, pendant que la neige tombait �
gros flocons, on entendit de longs sifflets qui venaient de l'est.
Une �norme ombre, pr�c�d�e d'une lueur fauve, s'avan�ait lentement,
consid�rablement grandie par les brumes, qui lui donnaient un aspect
fantastique.

Cependant on n'attendait encore aucun train venant de l'est. Les
secours r�clam�s par le t�l�graphe ne pouvaient arriver sit�t, et le
train d'Omaha � San Francisco ne devait passer que le lendemain. --
On fut bient�t fix�.

Cette locomotive qui marchait � petite vapeur, en jetant de grands
coups de sifflet, c'�tait celle qui, apr�s avoir �t� d�tach�e du
train, avait continu� sa route avec une si effrayante vitesse,
emportant le chauffeur et le m�canicien inanim�s. Elle avait couru
sur les rails pendant plusieurs milles ; puis, le feu avait baiss�,
faute de combustible ; la vapeur s'�tait d�tendue, et une heure apr�s,
ralentissant peu � peu sa marche, la machine s'arr�tait enfin � vingt
milles au-del� de la station de Kearney.

Ni le m�canicien ni le chauffeur n'avaient succomb�, et, apr�s un
�vanouissement assez prolong�, ils �taient revenus � eux.

La machine �tait alors arr�t�e. Quand il se vit dans le d�sert, la
locomotive seule, n'ayant plus de wagons � sa suite, le m�canicien
comprit ce qui s'�tait pass�. Comment la locomotive avait �t�
d�tach�e du train, il ne put le deviner, mais il n'�tait pas douteux,
pour lui, que le train, rest� en arri�re, se trouv�t en d�tresse.

Le m�canicien n'h�sita pas sur ce qu'il devait faire. Continuer la
route dans la direction d'Omaha �tait prudent ; retourner vers le
train, que les Indiens pillaient peut-�tre encore, �tait dangereux...
N'importe ! Des pellet�es de charbon et de bois furent engouffr�es
dans le foyer de sa chaudi�re, le feu se ranima, la pression monta de
nouveau, et, vers deux heures apr�s midi, la machine revenait en
arri�re vers la station de Kearney. C'�tait elle qui sifflait dans la
brume.

Ce fut une grande satisfaction pour les voyageurs, quand ils virent la
locomotive se mettre en t�te du train. Ils allaient pouvoir continuer
ce voyage si malheureusement interrompu.

A l'arriv�e de la machine, Mrs. Aouda avait quitt� la gare, et
s'adressant au conducteur :

� Vous allez partir ? lui demanda-t-elle.

-- A l'instant, madame.

-- Mais ces prisonniers... nos malheureux compagnons...

-- Je ne puis interrompre le service, r�pondit le conducteur. Nous
avons d�j� trois heures de retard.

-- Et quand passera l'autre train venant de San Francisco ?

-- Demain soir, madame.

-- Demain soir ! mais il sera trop tard. Il faut attendre...

-- C'est impossible, r�pondit le conducteur. Si vous voulez partir,
montez en voiture.

-- Je ne partirai pas �, r�pondit la jeune femme. Fix avait entendu
cette conversation. Quelques instants auparavant, quand tout moyen de
locomotion lui manquait, il �tait d�cid� � quitter Kearney, et
maintenant que le train �tait l�, pr�t � s'�lancer, qu'il n'avait plus
qu'� reprendre sa place dans le wagon, une irr�sistible force le
rattachait au sol. Ce quai de la gare lui br�lait les pieds, et il ne
pouvait s'en arracher. Le combat recommen�ait en lui. La col�re de
l'insucc�s l'�touffait. Il voulait lutter jusqu'au bout.

Cependant les voyageurs et quelques bless�s -- entre autres le colonel
Proctor, dont l'�tat �tait grave -- avaient pris place dans les
wagons. On entendait les bourdonnements de la chaudi�re surchauff�e,
et la vapeur s'�chappait par les soupapes. Le m�canicien siffla, le
train se mit en marche, et disparut bient�t, m�lant sa fum�e blanche
au tourbillon des neiges.

L'inspecteur Fix �tait rest�.

Quelques heures s'�coul�rent. Le temps �tait fort mauvais, le froid
tr�s vif. Fix, assis sur un banc dans la gare, restait immobile. On
e�t pu croire qu'il dormait. Mrs. Aouda, malgr� la rafale, quittait
� chaque instant la chambre qui avait �t� mise � sa disposition. Elle
venait � l'extr�mit� du quai, cherchant � voir � travers la temp�te de
neige, voulant percer cette brume qui r�duisait l'horizon autour
d'elle, �coutant si quelque bruit se ferait entendre. Mais rien.
Elle rentrait alors, toute transie, pour revenir quelques moments plus
tard, et toujours inutilement.

Le soir se fit. Le petit d�tachement n'�tait pas de retour. O�
�tait-il en ce moment ? Avait-il pu rejoindre les Indiens ? Y
avait-il eu lutte, ou ces soldats, perdus dans la brume, erraient-ils
au hasard ? Le capitaine du fort Kearney �tait tr�s inquiet, bien
qu'il ne voul�t rien laisser para�tre de son inqui�tude.

La nuit vint, la neige tomba moins abondamment, mais l'intensit� du
froid s'accrut. Le regard le plus intr�pide n'e�t pas consid�r� sans
�pouvante cette obscure immensit�. Un absolu silence r�gnait sur la
plaine. Ni le vol d'un oiseau, ni la pass�e d'un fauve n'en troublait
le calme infini.

Pendant toute cette nuit, Mrs. Aouda, l'esprit plein de
pressentiments sinistres, le coeur rempli d'angoisses, erra sur la
lisi�re de la prairie. Son imagination l'emportait au loin et lui
montrait mille dangers. Ce qu'elle souffrit pendant ces longues
heures ne saurait s'exprimer.

Fix �tait toujours immobile � la m�me place, mais, lui non plus, il ne
dormait pas. A un certain moment, un homme s'�tait approch�, lui
avait parl� m�me, mais l'agent l'avait renvoy�, apr�s r�pondu � ses
paroles par un signe n�gatif.

La nuit s'�coula ainsi. A l'aube, le disque � demi �teint du soleil
se leva sur un horizon embrum�. Cependant la port�e du regard pouvait
s'�tendre � une distance de deux milles. C'�tait vers le sud que
Phileas Fogg et le d�tachement s'�taient dirig�s... Le sud �tait
absolument d�sert. Il �tait alors sept heures du matin.

Le capitaine, extr�mement soucieux, ne savait quel parti prendre.
Devait-il envoyer un second d�tachement au secours du premier ?
Devait-il sacrifier de nouveaux hommes avec si peu de chances de
sauver ceux qui �taient sacrifi�s tout d'abord ? Mais son h�sitation
ne dura pas, et d'un geste, appelant un de ses lieutenants, il lui
donnait l'ordre de pousser une reconnaissance dans le sud --, quand
des coups de feu �clat�rent. �tait-ce un signal ? Les soldats se
jet�rent hors du fort, et � un demi-mille ils aper�urent une petite
troupe qui revenait en bon ordre.

Mr. Fogg marchait en t�te, et pr�s de lui Passepartout et les deux
autres voyageurs, arrach�s aux mains des Sioux.

Il y avait eu combat � dix milles au sud de Kearney. Peu d'instants
avant l'arriv�e du d�tachement, Passepartout et ses deux compagnons
luttaient d�j� contre leurs gardiens, et le Fran�ais en avait assomm�
trois � coups de poing, quand son ma�tre et les soldats se
pr�cipit�rent � leur secours.

Tous, les sauveurs et les sauv�s, furent accueillis par des cris de
joie, et Phileas Fogg distribua aux soldats la prime qu'il leur avait
promise, tandis que Passepartout se r�p�tait, non sans quelque
raison :

� D�cid�ment, il faut avouer que je co�te cher � mon ma�tre ! �

Fix, sans prononcer une parole, regardait Mr. Fogg, et il e�t �t�
difficile d'analyser les impressions qui se combattaient alors en lui.
Quant � Mrs. Aouda, elle avait pris la main du gentleman, et elle la
serrait dans les siennes, sans pouvoir prononcer une parole !

Cependant Passepartout, d�s son arriv�e, avait cherch� le train dans
la gare. Il croyait le trouver l�, pr�t � filer sur Omaha, et il
esp�rait que l'on pourrait encore regagner le temps perdu.

� Le train, le train ! s'�cria-t-il.

-- Parti, r�pondit Fix.

-- Et le train suivant, quand passera-t-il ? demanda Phileas Fogg.

-- Ce soir seulement.

-- Ah ! � r�pondit simplement l'impassible gentleman.

                                 XXXI
                         --------------------
         DANS LEQUEL L'INSPECTEUR FIX PREND TR�S S�RIEUSEMENT
                     LES INT�R�TS DE PHILEAS FOGG

Phileas Fogg se trouvait en retard de vingt heures. Passepartout, la
cause involontaire de ce retard, �tait d�sesp�r�. Il avait d�cid�ment
ruin� son ma�tre !

En ce moment, l'inspecteur s'approcha de Mr. Fogg, et, le regardant
bien en face :

� Tr�s s�rieusement, monsieur, lui demanda-t-il, vous �tes press� ?

-- Tr�s s�rieusement, r�pondit Phileas Fogg.

-- J'insiste, reprit Fix. Vous avez bien int�r�t � �tre � New York le
11, avant neuf heures du soir, heure du d�part du paquebot de
Liverpool ?

-- Un int�r�t majeur.

-- Et si votre voyage n'e�t pas �t� interrompu par cette attaque
d'Indiens, vous seriez arriv� � New York le 11, d�s le matin ?

-- Oui, avec douze heures d'avance sur le paquebot.

-- Bien. Vous avez donc vingt heures de retard. Entre vingt et
douze, l'�cart est de huit. C'est huit heures � regagner.
Voulez-vous tenter de le faire ?

-- A pied ? demanda Mr. Fogg.

-- Non, en tra�neau, r�pondit Fix, en tra�neau � voiles. Un homme m'a
propos� ce moyen de transport. �

C'�tait l'homme qui avait parl� � l'inspecteur de police pendant la
nuit, et dont Fix avait refus� l'offre.

Phileas Fogg ne r�pondit pas � Fix ; mais Fix lui ayant montr� l'homme
en question qui se promenait devant la gare, le gentleman alla � lui.
Un instant apr�s, Phileas Fogg et cet Am�ricain, nomm� Mudge,
entraient dans une hutte construite au bas du fort Kearney.

L�, Mr. Fogg examina un assez singulier v�hicule, sorte de ch�ssis,
�tabli sur deux longues poutres, un peu relev�es � l'avant comme les
semelles d'un tra�neau, et sur lequel cinq ou six personnes pouvaient
prendre place. Au tiers du ch�ssis, sur l'avant, se dressait un m�t
tr�s �lev�, sur lequel s'enverguait une immense brigantine. Ce m�t,
solidement retenu par des haubans m�talliques, tendait un �tai de fer
qui servait � guinder un foc de grande dimension. A l'arri�re, une
sorte de gouvernail-godille permettait de diriger l'appareil.

C'�tait, on le voit, un tra�neau gr�� en sloop. Pendant l'hiver, sur
la plaine glac�e, lorsque les trains sont arr�t�s par les neiges, ces
v�hicules font des travers�es extr�mement rapides d'une station �
l'autre. Ils sont, d'ailleurs, prodigieusement voil�s -- plus voil�s
m�me que ne peut l'�tre un cotre de course, expos� � chavirer --, et,
vent arri�re, ils glissent � la surface des prairies avec une rapidit�
�gale, sinon sup�rieure, � celle des express.

En quelques instants, un march� fut conclu entre Mr. Fogg et le
patron de cette embarcation de terre. Le vent �tait bon. Il
soufflait de l'ouest en grande brise. La neige �tait durcie, et Mudge
se faisait fort de conduire Mr. Fogg en quelques heures � la station
d'Omaha. L�, les trains sont fr�quents et les voies nombreuses, qui
conduisent � Chicago et � New York. Il n'�tait pas impossible que le
retard f�t regagn�. Il n'y avait donc pas � h�siter � tenter
l'aventure.

Mr. Fogg, ne voulant pas exposer Mrs. Aouda aux tortures d'une
travers�e en plein air, par ce froid que la vitesse rendrait plus
insupportable encore, lui proposa de rester sous la garde de
Passepartout � la station de Kearney. L'honn�te gar�on se chargerait
de ramener la jeune femme en Europe par une route meilleure et dans
des conditions plus acceptables.

Mrs. Aouda refusa de se s�parer de Mr. Fogg, et Passepartout se
sentit tr�s heureux de cette d�termination. En effet, pour rien au
monde il n'e�t voulu quitter son ma�tre, puisque Fix devait
l'accompagner.

Quant � ce que pensait alors l'inspecteur de police ce serait
difficile � dire. Sa conviction avait-elle �t� �branl�e par le retour
de Phileas Fogg, ou bien le tenait-il pour un coquin extr�mement fort,
qui, son tour du monde accompli, devait croire qu'il serait absolument
en s�ret� en Angleterre ? Peut-�tre l'opinion de Fix touchant Phileas
Fogg �tait-elle en effet modifi�e. Mais il n'en �tait pas moins
d�cid� � faire son devoir et, plus impatient que tous, � presser de
tout son pouvoir le retour en Angleterre.

A huit heures, le tra�neau �tait pr�t � partir. Les voyageurs -- on
serait tent� de dire les passagers -- y prenaient place et se
serraient �troitement dans leurs couvertures de voyage. Les deux
immenses voiles �taient hiss�es, et, sous l'impulsion du vent, le
v�hicule filait sur la neige durcie avec une rapidit� de quarante
milles � l'heure.

La distance qui s�pare le fort Kearney d'Omaha est, en droite ligne --
� vol d'abeille, comme disent les Am�ricains --, de deux cents milles
au plus. Si le vent tenait, en cinq heures cette distance pouvait
�tre franchie. Si aucun incident ne se produisait, � une heure apr�s
midi le tra�neau devait avoir atteint Omaha.

Quelle travers�e ! Les voyageurs, press�s les uns contre les autres,
ne pouvaient se parler. Le froid, accru par la vitesse, leur e�t
coup� la parole. Le tra�neau glissait aussi l�g�rement � la surface
de la plaine qu'une embarcation � la surface des eaux --, avec la
houle en moins. Quand la brise arrivait en rasant la terre, il
semblait que le tra�neau f�t enlev� du sol par ses voiles, vastes
ailes d'une immense envergure. Mudge, au gouvernail se maintenait
dans la ligne droite, et, d'un coup de godille il rectifiait les
embard�es que l'appareil tendait � faire. Toute la toile portait. Le
foc avait �t� perqu� et n'�tait plus abrit� par la brigantine. Un m�t
de hune fut guind�, et une fl�che, tendue au vent, ajouta sa puissance
d'impulsion � celle des autres voiles. On ne pouvait l'estimer,
math�matiquement, mais certainement la vitesse du tra�neau ne devait
pas �tre moindre de quarante milles � l'heure.

� Si rien ne casse, dit Mudge, nous arriverons ! �

Et Mudge avait int�r�t � arriver dans le d�lai convenu, car Mr. Fogg,
fid�le � son syst�me, l'avait all�ch� par une forte prime.

La prairie, que le tra�neau coupait en ligne droite, �tait plate comme
une mer. On e�t dit un immense �tang glac�. Le rail-road qui
desservait cette partie du territoire remontait, du sud-ouest au
nord-ouest, par Grand-Island, Columbus, ville importante du Nebraska,
Schuyler, Fremont, puis Omaha. Il suivait pendant tout son parcours
la rive droite de Platte-river. Le tra�neau, abr�geant cette route,
prenait la corde de l'arc d�crit par le chemin de fer. Mudge ne
pouvait craindre d'�tre arr�t� par la Platte-river, � ce petit coude
qu'elle fait en avant de Fremont, puisque ses eaux �taient glac�es.
Le chemin �tait donc enti�rement d�barrass� d'obstacles, et Phileas
Fogg n'avait donc que deux circonstances � redouter : une avarie �
l'appareil, un changement ou une tomb�e du vent.

Mais la brise ne mollissait pas. Au contraire. Elle soufflait �
courber le m�t, que les haubans de fer maintenaient solidement. Ces
filins m�talliques, semblables aux cordes d'un instrument, r�sonnaient
comme si un archet e�t provoqu� leurs vibrations. Le tra�neau
s'enlevait au milieu d'une harmonie plaintive, d'une intensit� toute
particuli�re.

� Ces cordes donnent la quinte et l'octave �, dit Mr. Fogg.

Et ce furent les seules paroles qu'il pronon�a pendant cette
travers�e. Mrs. Aouda, soigneusement empaquet�e dans les fourrures
et les couvertures de voyage, �tait, autant que possible, pr�serv�e
des atteintes du froid.

Quant � Passepartout, la face rouge comme le disque solaire quand il
se couche dans les brumes, il humait cet air piquant. Avec le fond
d'imperturbable confiance qu'il poss�dait, il s'�tait repris �
esp�rer. Au lieu d'arriver le matin � New York, on y arriverait le
soir, mais il y avait encore quelques chances pour que ce f�t avant le
d�part du paquebot de Liverpool.

Passepartout avait m�me �prouv� une forte envie de serrer la main de
son alli� Fix. Il n'oubliait pas que c'�tait l'inspecteur lui-m�me
qui avait procur� le tra�neau � voiles, et, par cons�quent, le seul
moyen qu'il y e�t de gagner Omaha en temps utile. Mais, par on ne
sait quel pressentiment, il se tint dans sa r�serve accoutum�e.

En tout cas, une chose que Passepartout n'oublierait jamais, c'�tait
le sacrifice que Mr. Fogg avait fait, sans h�siter, pour l'arracher
aux mains des Sioux. A cela, Mr. Fogg avait risqu� sa fortune et sa
vie... Non ! son serviteur ne l'oublierait pas !

Pendant que chacun des voyageurs se laissait aller � des r�flexions si
diverses, le tra�neau volait sur l'immense tapis de neige. S'il
passait quelques creeks, affluents ou sous-affluents de la
Little-Blue-river, on ne s'en apercevait pas. Les champs et les cours
d'eau disparaissaient sous une blancheur uniforme. La plaine �tait
absolument d�serte. Comprise entre l'Union Pacific Road et
l'embranchement qui doit r�unir Kearney � Saint-Joseph, elle formait
comme une grande �le inhabit�e. Pas un village, pas une station, pas
m�me un fort. De temps en temps, on voyait passer comme un �clair
quelque arbre grima�ant, dont le blanc squelette se tordait sous la
brise. Parfois, des bandes d'oiseaux sauvages s'enlevaient du m�me
vol. Parfois aussi, quelques loups de prairies, en troupes
nombreuses, maigres, affam�s, pouss�s par un besoin f�roce, luttaient
de vitesse avec le tra�neau. Alors Passepartout, le revolver � la
main, se tenait pr�t � faire feu sur les plus rapproch�s. Si quelque
accident e�t alors arr�t� le tra�neau, les voyageurs, attaqu�s par ces
f�roces carnassiers, auraient couru les plus grands risques. Mais le
tra�neau tenait bon, il ne tardait pas � prendre de l'avance, et
bient�t toute la bande hurlante restait en arri�re.

A midi, Mudge reconnut � quelques indices qu'il passait le cours glac�
de la Platte-river. Il ne dit rien, mais il �tait d�j� s�r que, vingt
milles plus loin, il aurait atteint la station d'Omaha.

Et, en effet, il n'�tait pas une heure, que ce guide habile,
abandonnant la barre, se pr�cipitait aux drisses des voiles et les
amenait en bande, pendant que le tra�neau, emport� par son
irr�sistible �lan, franchissait encore un demi-mille � sec de toile.
Enfin il s'arr�ta, et Mudge, montrant un amas de toits blancs de
neige, disait :

� Nous sommes arriv�s. �

Arriv�s ! Arriv�s, en effet, � cette station qui, par des trains
nombreux, est quotidiennement en communication avec l'est des
�tats-Unis !

Passepartout et Fix avaient saut� � terre et secouaient leurs membres
engourdis. Ils aid�rent Mr. Fogg et la jeune femme � descendre du
tra�neau. Phileas Fogg r�gla g�n�reusement avec Mudge, auquel
Passepartout serra la main comme � un ami, et tous se pr�cipit�rent
vers la gare d'Omaha.

C'est � cette importante cit� du Nebraska que s'arr�te le chemin de
fer du Pacifique proprement dit, qui met le bassin du Mississippi en
communication avec le grand oc�an. Pour aller d'Omaha � Chicago, le
rail-road, sous le nom de � Chicago-Rock-island-road �, court
directement dans l'est en desservant cinquante stations.

Un train direct �tait pr�t � partir. Phileas Fogg et ses compagnons
n'eurent que le temps de se pr�cipiter dans un wagon. Ils n'avaient
rien vu d'Omaha, mais Passepartout s'avoua � lui-m�me qu'il n'y avait
pas lieu de le regretter, et que ce n'�tait pas de voir qu'il
s'agissait.

Avec une extr�me rapidit�, ce train passa dans l'�tat d'Iowa, par
Council-Bluffs, Des Moines, Iowa-city. Pendant la nuit, il traversait
le Mississippi � Davenport, et par Rock-Island, il entrait dans
l'Illinois. Le lendemain, 10, � quatre heures du soir il arrivait �
Chicago, d�j� relev�e de ses ruines, et plus fi�rement assise que
jamais sur les bords de son beau lac Michigan.

Neuf cents milles s�parent Chicago de New York. Les trains ne
manquaient pas � Chicago. Mr. Fogg passa imm�diatement de l'un dans
l'autre. La fringante locomotive du
� Pittsburg-Fort-Wayne-Chicago-rail-road � partit � toute vitesse,
comme si elle e�t compris que l'honorable gentleman n'avait pas de
temps � perdre. Elle traversa comme un �clair l'Indiana, l'Ohio, la
Pennsylvanie, le New Jersey, passant par des villes aux noms antiques,
dont quelques-unes avaient des rues et des tramways, mais pas de
maisons encore. Enfin l'Hudson apparut, et, le 11 d�cembre, � onze
heures un quart du soir, le train s'arr�tait dans la gare, sur la rive
droite du fleuve, devant le � pier � m�me des steamers de la ligne
Cunard, autrement dite � British and North American royal mail steam
packet Co. �

Le _China_, � destination de Liverpool, �tait parti depuis
quarante-cinq minutes !

                                XXXII
                         --------------------
                 DANS LEQUEL PHILEAS FOGG ENGAGE UNE
               LUTTE DIRECTE CONTRE LA MAUVAISE CHANCE

En partant, le _China_ semblait avoir emport� avec lui le dernier
espoir de Phileas Fogg.

En effet, aucun des autres paquebots qui font le service direct entre
l'Am�rique et l'Europe, ni les transatlantiques fran�ais, ni les
navires du � White-Star-line �, ni les steamers de la Compagnie Imman,
ni ceux de la ligne Hambourgeoise, ni autres, ne pouvaient servir les
projets du gentleman.

En effet, le _Pereire_, de la Compagnie transatlantique fran�aise --
dont les admirables b�timents �galent en vitesse et surpassent en
confortable tous ceux des autres lignes, sans exception --, ne partait
que le surlendemain, 14 d�cembre. Et d'ailleurs, de m�me que ceux de
la Compagnie hambourgeoise, il n'allait pas directement � Liverpool ou
� Londres, mais au Havre, et cette travers�e suppl�mentaire du Havre �
Southampton, en retardant Phileas Fogg, e�t annul� ses derniers
efforts.

Quant aux paquebots Imman, dont l'un, le _City-of-Paris_, mettait en
mer le lendemain, il n'y fallait pas songer. Ces navires sont
particuli�rement affect�s au transport des �migrants, leurs machines
sont faibles, ils naviguent autant � la voile qu'� la vapeur, et leur
vitesse est m�diocre. Ils employaient � cette travers�e de New York �
l'Angleterre plus de temps qu'il n'en restait � Mr. Fogg pour gagner
son pari.

De tout ceci le gentleman se rendit parfaitement compte en consultant
son _Bradshaw_, qui lui donnait, jour par jour, les mouvements de la
navigation transoc�anienne.

Passepartout �tait an�anti. Avoir manqu� le paquebot de quarante-cinq
minutes, cela le tuait. C'�tait sa faute � lui, qui, au lieu d'aider
son ma�tre, n'avait cess� de semer des obstacles sur sa route ! Et
quand il revoyait dans son esprit tous les incidents du voyage, quand
il supputait les sommes d�pens�es en pure perte et dans son seul
int�r�t, quand il songeait que cet �norme pari, en y joignant les
frais consid�rables de ce voyage devenu inutile, ruinait compl�tement
Mr. Fogg, il s'accablait d'injures.

Mr. Fogg ne lui fit, cependant, aucun reproche, et, en quittant le
pier des paquebots transatlantiques, il ne dit que ces mots :

� Nous aviserons demain. Venez. �

Mr. Fogg, Mrs. Aouda, Fix, Passepartout travers�rent l'Hudson dans
le Jersey-city-ferry-boat, et mont�rent dans un fiacre, qui les
conduisit � l'h�tel Saint-Nicolas, dans Broadway. Des chambres furent
mises � leur disposition, et la nuit se passa, courte pour Phileas
Fogg, qui dormit d'un sommeil parfait, mais bien longue pour Mrs.
Aouda et ses compagnons, auxquels leur agitation ne permit pas de
reposer.

Le lendemain, c'�tait le 12 d�cembre. Du 12, sept heures du matin, au
21, huit heures quarante-cinq minutes du soir, il restait neuf jours
treize heures et quarante-cinq minutes. Si donc Phileas Fogg f�t
parti la veille par le _China_, l'un des meilleurs marcheurs de la
ligne Cunard, il serait arriv� � Liverpool, puis � Londres, dans les
d�lais voulus !

Mr. Fogg quitta l'h�tel, seul, apr�s avoir recommand� � son
domestique de l'attendre et de pr�venir Mrs. Aouda de se tenir pr�te
� tout instant.

Mr. Fogg se rendit aux rives de l'Hudson, et parmi les navires
amarr�s au quai ou ancr�s dans le fleuve, il rechercha avec soin ceux
qui �taient en partance. Plusieurs b�timents avaient leur guidon de
d�part et se pr�paraient � prendre la mer � la mar�e du matin, car
dans cet immense et admirable port de New York, il n'est pas de jour
o� cent navires ne fassent route pour tous les points du monde ; mais
la plupart �taient des b�timents � voiles, et ils ne pouvaient
convenir � Phileas Fogg.

Ce gentleman semblait devoir �chouer dans sa derni�re tentative, quand
il aper�ut, mouill� devant la Batterie, � une encablure au plus, un
navire de commerce � h�lice, de formes fines, dont la chemin�e,
laissant �chapper de gros flocons de fum�e, indiquait qu'il se
pr�parait � appareiller.

Phileas Fogg h�la un canot, s'y embarqua, et, en quelques coups
d'aviron, il se trouvait � l'�chelle de l'_Henrietta_, steamer � coque
de fer, dont tous les hauts �taient en bois.

Le capitaine de l'_Henrietta_ �tait � bord. Phileas Fogg monta sur le
pont et fit demander le capitaine. Celui-ci se pr�senta aussit�t.

C'�tait un homme de cinquante ans, une sorte le loup de mer, un bougon
qui ne devait pas �tre commode. Gros yeux, teint de cuivre oxyd�,
cheveux rouges, forte encolure, -- rien de l'aspect d'un homme du
monde.

� Le capitaine ? demanda Mr. Fogg.

-- C'est moi.

-- Je suis Phileas Fogg, de Londres.

-- Et moi, Andrew Speedy, de Cardif.

-- Vous allez partir ?...

-- Dans une heure.

-- Vous �tes charg� pour... ?

-- Bordeaux.

-- Et votre cargaison ?

-- Des cailloux dans le ventre. Pas de fret. Je pars sur lest.

-- Vous avez des passagers ?

-- Pas de passagers. Jamais de passagers. Marchandise encombrante et
raisonnante.

-- Votre navire marche bien ?

-- Entre onze et douze noeuds. L'_Henrietta_, bien connue.

-- Voulez-vous me transporter � Liverpool, moi et trois personnes ?

-- A Liverpool ? Pourquoi pas en Chine ?

-- Je dis Liverpool.

-- Non !

-- Non ?

-- Non. Je suis en partance pour Bordeaux, et je vais � Bordeaux.

-- N'importe quel prix ?

-- N'importe quel prix. �

Le capitaine avait parl� d'un ton qui n'admettait pas de r�plique.

� Mais les armateurs de l'_Henrietta_... reprit Phileas Fogg.

-- Les armateurs, c'est moi, r�pondit le capitaine. Le navire
m'appartient.

-- Je vous affr�te.

-- Non.

-- Je vous l'ach�te.

-- Non. �

Phileas Fogg ne sourcilla pas. Cependant la situation �tait grave.
Il n'en �tait pas de New York comme de Hong-Kong, ni du capitaine de
l'_Henrietta_ comme du patron de la _Tankad�re_. Jusqu'ici l'argent
du gentleman avait toujours eu raison des obstacles. Cette fois-ci,
l'argent �chouait.

Cependant, il fallait trouver le moyen de traverser l'Atlantique en
bateau -- � moins de le traverser en ballon --, ce qui e�t �t� fort
aventureux, et ce qui, d'ailleurs, n'�tait pas r�alisable.

Il para�t, pourtant, que Phileas Fogg eut une id�e, car il dit au
capitaine :

� Eh bien, voulez-vous me mener � Bordeaux ?

-- Non, quand m�me vous me paieriez deux cents dollars !

-- Je vous en offre deux mille (10 000 F).

-- Par personne ?

-- Par personne.

-- Et vous �tes quatre ?

-- Quatre. �

Le capitaine Speedy commen�a � se gratter le front, comme s'il e�t
voulu en arracher l'�piderme. Huit mille dollars � gagner, sans
modifier son voyage, cela valait bien la peine qu'il m�t de c�t� son
antipathie prononc�e pour toute esp�ce de passager. Des passagers �
deux mille dollars, d'ailleurs, ce ne sont plus des passagers, c'est
de la marchandise pr�cieuse.

� Je pars � neuf heures, dit simplement le capitaine Speedy, et si
vous et les v�tres, vous �tes l� ?...

-- A neuf heures, nous serons � bord ! � r�pondit non moins
simplement Mr. Fogg.

Il �tait huit heures et demie. D�barquer de l'_Henrietta_, monter
dans une voiture, se rendre � l'h�tel Saint-Nicolas, en ramener Mrs.
Aouda, Passepartout, et m�me l'ins�parable Fix, auquel il offrait
gracieusement le passage, cela fut fait par le gentleman avec ce calme
qui ne l'abandonnait en aucune circonstance.

Au moment o� l'_Henrietta_ appareillait, tous quatre �taient � bord.

Lorsque Passepartout apprit ce que co�terait cette derni�re travers�e,
il poussa un de ces � Oh ! � prolong�s, qui parcourent tous les
intervalles de la gamme chromatique descendante !

Quant � l'inspecteur Fix, il se dit que d�cid�ment la Banque
d'Angleterre ne sortirait pas indemne de cette affaire. En effet, en
arrivant et en admettant que le sieur Fogg n'en jet�t pas encore
quelques poign�es � la mer, plus de sept mille livres (175 000 F)
manqueraient au sac � bank-notes !

                                XXXIII
                         --------------------
       O� PHILEAS FOGG SE MONTRE A LA HAUTEUR DES CIRCONSTANCES

Une heure apr�s, le steamer _Henrietta_ d�passait le Light-boat qui
marque l'entr�e de l'Hudson, tournait la pointe de Sandy-Hook et
donnait en mer. Pendant la journ�e, il prolongea Long-Island, au
large du feu de Fire-Island, et courut rapidement vers l'est.

Le lendemain, 13 d�cembre, � midi, un homme monta sur la passerelle
pour faire le point. Certes, on doit croire que cet homme �tait le
capitaine Speedy ! Pas le moins du monde. C'�tait Phileas Fogg.
esq.

Quant au capitaine Speedy, il �tait tout bonnement enferm� � clef dans
sa cabine, et poussait des hurlements qui d�notaient une col�re, bien
pardonnable, pouss�e jusqu'au paroxysme.

Ce qui s'�tait pass� �tait tr�s simple. Phileas Fogg voulait aller �
Liverpool, le capitaine ne voulait pas l'y conduire. Alors Phileas
Fogg avait accept� de prendre passage pour Bordeaux, et, depuis trente
heures qu'il �tait � bord, il avait si bien manoeuvr� � coups de
bank-notes, que l'�quipage, matelots et chauffeurs -- �quipage un peu
interlope, qui �tait en assez mauvais termes avec le capitaine --, lui
appartenait. Et voil� pourquoi Phileas Fogg commandait au lieu et
place du capitaine Speedy, pourquoi le capitaine �tait enferm� dans sa
cabine, et pourquoi enfin l'_Henrietta_ se dirigeait vers Liverpool.
Seulement, il �tait tr�s clair, � voir manoeuvrer Mr. Fogg, que Mr.
Fogg avait �t� marin.

Maintenant, comment finirait l'aventure, on le saurait plus tard.
Toutefois, Mrs. Aouda ne laissait pas d'�tre inqui�te, sans en rien
dire. Fix, lui, avait �t� abasourdi tout d'abord. Quant �
Passepartout, il trouvait la chose tout simplement adorable.

� Entre onze et douze noeuds �, avait dit le capitaine Speedy, et en
effet l'_Henrietta_ se maintenait dans cette moyenne de vitesse.

Si donc -- que de � si � encore ! -- si donc la mer ne devenait pas
trop mauvaise, si le vent ne sautait pas dans l'est, s'il ne survenait
aucune avarie au b�timent, aucun accident � la machine, l'_Henrietta_,
dans les neuf jours compt�s du 12 d�cembre au 21, pouvait franchir les
trois mille milles qui s�parent New York de Liverpool. Il est vrai
qu'une fois arriv�, l'affaire de l'_Henrietta_ brochant sur l'affaire
de la Banque, cela pouvait mener le gentleman un peu plus loin qu'il
ne voudrait.

Pendant les premiers jours, la navigation se fit dans d'excellentes
conditions. La mer n'�tait pas trop dure ; le vent paraissait fix� au
nord-est ; les voiles furent �tablies, et, sous ses go�lettes,
l'_Henrietta_ marcha comme un vrai transatlantique.

Passepartout �tait enchant�. Le dernier exploit de son ma�tre, dont
il ne voulait pas voir les cons�quences, l'enthousiasmait. Jamais
l'�quipage n'avait vu un gar�on plus gai, plus agile. Il faisait
mille amiti�s aux matelots et les �tonnait par ses tours de voltige.
Il leur prodiguait les meilleurs noms et les boissons les plus
attrayantes. Pour lui, ils manoeuvraient comme des gentlemen, et les
chauffeurs chauffaient comme des h�ros. Sa bonne humeur, tr�s
communicative, s'impr�gnait � tous. Il avait oubli� le pass�, les
ennuis, les p�rils. Il ne songeait qu'� ce but, si pr�s d'�tre
atteint, et parfois il bouillait d'impatience, comme s'il e�t �t�
chauff� par les fourneaux de l'_Henrietta_. Souvent aussi, le digne
gar�on tournait autour de Fix ; il le regardait d'un oeil � qui en
disait long �! mais il ne lui parlait pas, car il n'existait plus
aucune intimit� entre les deux anciens amis.

D'ailleurs Fix, il faut le dire, n'y comprenait plus rien ! La
conqu�te de l'_Henrietta_, l'achat de son �quipage, ce Fogg
manoeuvrant comme un marin consomm�, tout cet ensemble de choses
l'�tourdissait. Il ne savait plus que penser ! Mais, apr�s tout, un
gentleman qui commen�ait par voler cinquante-cinq mille livres pouvait
bien finir par voler un b�timent. Et Fix fut naturellement amen� �
croire que l'_Henrietta_, dirig�e par Fogg, n'allait point du tout �
Liverpool, mais dans quelque point du monde o� le voleur, devenu
pirate, se mettrait tranquillement en s�ret�! Cette hypoth�se, il
faut bien l'avouer, �tait on ne peut plus plausible, et le d�tective
commen�ait � regretter tr�s s�rieusement de s'�tre embarqu� dans cette
affaire.

Quant au capitaine Speedy, il continuait � hurler dans sa cabine, et
Passepartout, charg� de pourvoir � sa nourriture, ne le faisait qu'en
prenant les plus grandes pr�cautions, quelque vigoureux qu'il f�t.
Mr. Fogg, lui, n'avait plus m�me l'air de se douter qu'il y e�t un
capitaine � bord.

Le 13, on passe sur la queue du banc de Terre-Neuve. Ce sont l� de
mauvais parages. Pendant l'hiver surtout, les brumes y sont
fr�quentes, les coups de vent redoutables. Depuis la veille, le
barom�tre, brusquement abaiss�, faisait pressentir un changement
prochain dans l'atmosph�re. En effet, pendant la nuit, la temp�rature
se modifia, le froid devint plus vif, et en m�me temps le vent sauta
dans le sud-est.

C'�tait un contretemps. Mr. Fogg, afin de ne point s'�carter de sa
route, dut serrer ses voiles et forcer de vapeur. N�anmoins, la
marche du navire fut ralentie, attendu l'�tat de la mer, dont les
longues lames brisaient contre son �trave. Il �prouva des mouvements
de tangage tr�s violents, et cela au d�triment de sa vitesse. La
brise tournait peu � peu � l'ouragan, et l'on pr�voyait d�j� le cas o�
l'_Henrietta_ ne pourrait plus se maintenir debout � la lame. Or,
s'il fallait fuir, c'�tait l'inconnu avec toutes ses mauvaises
chances.

Le visage de Passepartout se rembrunit en m�me temps que le ciel, et,
pendant deux jours, l'honn�te gar�on �prouva de mortelles transes.
Mais Phileas Fogg �tait un marin hardi, qui savait tenir t�te � la
mer, et il fit toujours route, m�me sans se mettre sous petite vapeur.
L'_Henrietta_, quand elle ne pouvait s'�lever � la lame, passait au
travers, et son pont �tait balay� en grand, mais elle passait.
Quelquefois aussi l'h�lice �mergeait, battant l'air de ses branches
affol�es, lorsqu'une montagne d'eau soulevait l'arri�re hors des
flots, mais le navire allait toujours de l'avant.

Toutefois le vent ne fra�chit pas autant qu'on aurait pu le craindre.
Ce ne fut pas un de ces ouragans qui passent avec une vitesse de
quatre-vingt-dix milles � l'heure. Il se tint au grand frais, mais
malheureusement il souffla avec obstination de la partie du sud-est et
ne permit pas de faire de la toile. Et cependant, ainsi qu'on va le
voir, il e�t �t� bien utile de venir en aide � la vapeur !

Le 16 d�cembre, c'�tait le soixante quinzi�me jour �coul� depuis le
d�part de Londres. En somme, l'_Henrietta_ n'avait pas encore un
retard inqui�tant. La moiti� de la travers�e �tait � peu pr�s faite,
et les plus mauvais parages avaient �t� franchis. En �t�, on e�t
r�pondu du succ�s. En hiver, on �tait � la merci de la mauvaise
saison. Passepartout ne se pronon�ait pas. Au fond, il avait espoir,
et, si le vent faisait d�faut, du moins il comptait sur la vapeur.

Or, ce jour-l�, le m�canicien �tant mont� sur le pont, rencontra Mr.
Fogg et s'entretint assez vivement avec lui.

Sans savoir pourquoi -- par un pressentiment sans doute --,
Passepartout �prouva comme une vague inqui�tude. Il e�t donn� une de
ses oreilles pour entendre de l'autre ce qui se disait l�. Cependant,
il put saisir quelques mots, ceux-ci entre autres, prononc�s par son
ma�tre :

� Vous �tes certain de ce que vous avancez ?

-- Certain, monsieur, r�pondit le m�canicien. N'oubliez pas que,
depuis notre d�part, nous chauffons avec tous nos fourneaux allum�s,
et si nous avions assez de charbon pour aller � petite vapeur de New
York � Bordeaux, nous n'en avons pas assez pour aller � toute vapeur
de New York � Liverpool !

-- J'aviserai �, r�pondit Mr. Fogg.

Passepartout avait compris. Il fut pris d'une inqui�tude mortelle.

Le charbon allait manquer !

� Ah ! si mon ma�tre pare celle-l�, se dit-il, d�cid�ment ce sera un
fameux homme ! �

Et ayant rencontr� Fix, il ne put s'emp�cher de le mettre au courant
de la situation.

� Alors, lui r�pondit l'agent les dents serr�es, vous croyez que nous
allons � Liverpool !

-- Parbleu !

-- Imb�cile ! � r�pondit l'inspecteur, qui s'en alla, haussant les
�paules.

Passepartout fut sur le point de relever vertement le qualificatif,
dont il ne pouvait d'ailleurs comprendre la vraie signification ; mais
il se dit que l'infortun� Fix devait �tre tr�s d�sappoint�, tr�s
humili� dans son amour-propre, apr�s avoir si maladroitement suivi une
fausse piste autour du monde, et il passa condamnation.

Et maintenant quel parti allait prendre Phileas Fogg ? Cela �tait
difficile � imaginer. Cependant, il para�t que le flegmatique
gentleman en prit un, car le soir m�me il fit venir le m�canicien et
lui dit :

� Poussez les feux et faites route jusqu'� complet �puisement du
combustible. �

Quelques instants apr�s, la chemin�e de l'_Henrietta_ vomissait des
torrents de fum�e.

Le navire continua donc de marcher � toute vapeur ; mais ainsi qu'il
l'avait annonc�, deux jours plus tard, le 18, le m�canicien fit savoir
que le charbon manquerait dans la journ�e.

� Que l'on ne laisse pas baisser les feux, r�pondit Mr. Fogg. Au
contraire. Que l'on charge les soupapes �.

Ce jour-l�, vers midi, apr�s avoir pris hauteur et calcul� la position
du navire, Phileas Fogg fit venir Passepartout, et il lui donna
l'ordre d'aller chercher le capitaine Speedy. C'�tait comme si on e�t
command� � ce brave gar�on d'aller d�cha�ner un tigre, et il descendit
dans la dunette, se disant :

� Positivement il sera enrag� ! �

En effet, quelques minutes plus tard, au milieu de cris et de jurons,
une bombe arrivait sur la dunette. Cette bombe, c'�tait le capitaine
Speedy. Il �tait �vident qu'elle allait �clater.

� O� sommes-nous ? � telles furent les premi�res paroles qu'il
pronon�a au milieu des suffocations de la col�re, et certes, pour peu
que le digne homme e�t �t� apoplectique, il n'en serait jamais revenu.

� O� sommes-nous ? r�p�ta-t-il, la face congestionn�e.

-- A sept cent soixante-dix milles de Liverpool (300 lieues), r�pondit
Mr. Fogg avec un calme imperturbable.

-- Pirate ! s'�cria Andrew Speedy.

-- Je vous ai fait venir, monsieur...

-- �cumeur de mer !

-- ...monsieur, reprit Phileas Fogg, pour vous prier de me vendre
votre navire.

-- Non ! de par tous les diables, non !

-- C'est que je vais �tre oblig� de le br�ler.

-- Br�ler mon navire !

-- Oui, du moins dans ses hauts, car nous manquons de combustible.

-- Br�ler mon navire ! s'�cria le capitaine Speedy, qui ne pouvait
m�me plus prononcer les syllabes. Un navire qui vaut cinquante mille
dollars (250 000 F).

-- En voici soixante mille (300 000 F)! r�pondit Phileas Fogg, en
offrant au capitaine une liasse de bank-notes.

Cela fit un effet prodigieux sur Andrew Speedy. On n'est pas
Am�ricain sans que la vue de soixante mille dollars vous cause une
certaine �motion. Le capitaine oublia en un instant sa col�re, son
emprisonnement, tous ses griefs contre son passager. Son navire avait
vingt ans. Cela pouvait devenir une affaire d'or !... La bombe ne
pouvait d�j� plus �clater. Mr. Fogg en avait arrach� la m�che.

� Et la coque en fer me restera, dit-il d'un ton singuli�rement
radouci.

-- La coque en fer et la machine, monsieur. Est-ce conclu ?

-- Conclu. �

Et Andrew Speedy, saisissant la liasse de bank-notes, les compta et
les fit dispara�tre dans sa poche.

Pendant cette sc�ne, Passepartout �tait blanc. Quant � Fix, il
faillit avoir un coup de sang. Pr�s de vingt mille livres d�pens�es,
et encore ce Fogg qui abandonnait � son vendeur la coque et la
machine, c'est-�-dire presque la valeur totale du navire ! Il est
vrai que la somme vol�e � la banque s'�levait � cinquante-cinq mille
livres !

Quand Andrew Speedy eut empoch� l'argent :

� Monsieur, lui dit Mr. Fogg, que tout ceci ne vous �tonne pas.
Sachez que je perds vingt mille livres, si je ne suis pas rendu �
Londres le 21 d�cembre, � huit heures quarante-cinq du soir. Or,
j'avais manqu� le paquebot de New York, et comme vous refusiez de me
conduire � Liverpool...

-- Et j'ai bien fait, par les cinquante mille diables de l'enfer,
s'�cria Andrew Speedy, puisque j'y gagne au moins quarante mille
dollars. �

Puis, plus pos�ment :

� Savez-vous une chose, ajouta-t-il, capitaine ?...

-- Fogg.

-- Capitaine Fogg, eh
bien, il y a du Yankee en vous �.

Et apr�s avoir fait � son passager ce qu'il croyait �tre un
compliment, il s'en allait, quand Phileas Fogg lui dit :

� Maintenant ce navire m'appartient ?

-- Certes, de la quille � la pomme des m�ts, pour tout ce qui est �
bois �, s'entend !

-- Bien. Faites d�molir les am�nagements int�rieurs et chauffez avec
ces d�bris. �

On juge ce qu'il fallut consommer de ce bois sec pour maintenir la
vapeur en suffisante pression. Ce jour-l�, la dunette, les rouffles,
les cabines, les logements, le faux pont, tout y passa.

Le lendemain, 19 d�cembre, on br�la la m�ture, les dromes, les
esparres. On abattit les m�ts, on les d�bita � coups de hache.
L'�quipage y mettait un z�le incroyable. Passepartout, taillant,
coupant, sciant, faisait l'ouvrage de dix hommes. C'�tait une fureur
de d�molition.

Le lendemain, 20, les bastingages, les pavois, les oeuvres-mortes, la
plus grande partie du pont, furent d�vor�s. L'_Henrietta_ n'�tait
plus qu'un b�timent ras� comme un ponton.

Mais, ce jour-l�, on avait eu connaissance de la c�te d'Irlande et du
feu de Fastenet.

Toutefois, � dix heures du soir, le navire n'�tait encore que par le
travers de Queenstown. Phileas Fogg n'avait plus que vingt-quatre
heures pour atteindre Londres ! Or, c'�tait le temps qu'il fallait �
l'_Henrietta_ pour gagner Liverpool, -- m�me en marchant � toute
vapeur. Et la vapeur allait manquer enfin � l'audacieux gentleman !

� Monsieur, lui dit alors le capitaine Speedy, qui avait fini par
s'int�resser � ses projets, je vous plains vraiment. Tout est contre
vous ! Nous ne sommes encore que devant Queenstown.

-- Ah ! fit Mr. Fogg, c'est Queenstown, cette ville dont nous
apercevons les feux ?

-- Oui.

-- Pouvons-nous entrer dans le port ?

-- Pas avant trois heures. A pleine mer seulement.

-- Attendons ! � r�pondit tranquillement Phileas Fogg, sans laisser
voir sur son visage que, par une supr�me inspiration, il allait tenter
de vaincre encore une fois la chance contraire !

En effet, Queenstown est un port de la c�te d'Irlande dans lequel les
transatlantiques qui viennent des �tats-Unis jettent en passant leur
sac aux lettres. Ces lettres sont emport�es � Dublin par des express
toujours pr�ts � partir. De Dublin elles arrivent � Liverpool par des
steamers de grande vitesse, -- devan�ant ainsi de douze heures les
marcheurs les plus rapides des compagnies maritimes.

Ces douze heures que gagnait ainsi le courrier d'Am�rique, Phileas
Fogg pr�tendait les gagner aussi. Au lieu d'arriver sur
l'_Henrietta_, le lendemain soir, � Liverpool, il y serait � midi, et,
par cons�quent, il aurait le temps d'�tre � Londres avant huit heures
quarante-cinq minutes du soir.

Vers une heure du matin, l'_Henrietta_ entrait � haute mer dans le
port de Queenstown, et Phileas Fogg, apr�s avoir re�u une vigoureuse
poign�e de main du capitaine Speedy, le laissait sur la carcasse ras�e
de son navire, qui valait encore la moiti� de ce qu'il l'avait
vendue !

Les passagers d�barqu�rent aussit�t. Fix, � ce moment, eut une envie
f�roce d'arr�ter le sieur Fogg. Il ne le fit pas, pourtant !
Pourquoi ? Quel combat se livrait donc en lui ? �tait-il revenu sur
le compte de Mr. Fogg ? Comprenait-il enfin qu'il s'�tait tromp� ?
Toutefois, Fix n'abandonna pas Mr. Fogg. Avec lui, avec Mrs. Aouda,
avec Passepartout, qui ne prenait plus le temps de respirer, il
montait dans le train de Queenstown � une heure et demi du matin,
arrivait � Dublin au jour naissant, et s'embarquait aussit�t sur un
des steamers -- vrais fuseaux d'acier, tout en machine -- qui,
d�daignant de s'�lever � la lame, passent invariablement au travers.

A midi moins vingt, le 21 d�cembre, Phileas Fogg d�barquait enfin sur
le quai de Liverpool. Il n'�tait plus qu'� six heures de Londres.

Mais � ce moment, Fix s'approcha, lui mit la main sur l'�paule, et,
exhibant son mandat :

� Vous �tes le sieur Phileas Fogg ? dit-il.

-- Oui, monsieur.

-- Au nom de la reine, je vous arr�te ! �

                                XXXIV
                         --------------------
        QUI PROCURE A PASSEPARTOUT L'OCCASION DE FAIRE UN JEU
                DE MOTS ATROCE, MAIS PEUT-�TRE IN�DIT

Phileas Fogg �tait en prison. On l'avait enferm� dans le poste de
Custom-house, la douane de Liverpool, et il devait y passer la nuit en
attendant son transf�rement � Londres.

Au moment de l'arrestation, Passepartout avait voulu se pr�cipiter sur
le d�tective. Des policemen le retinrent. Mrs. Aouda, �pouvant�e
par la brutalit� du fait, ne sachant rien, n'y pouvait rien
comprendre. Passepartout lui expliqua la situation. Mr. Fogg, cet
honn�te et courageux gentleman, auquel elle devait la vie, �tait
arr�t� comme voleur. La jeune femme protesta contre une telle
all�gation, son coeur s'indigna, et des pleurs coul�rent de ses yeux,
quand elle vit qu'elle ne pouvait rien faire, rien tenter, pour sauver
son sauveur.

Quant � Fix, il avait arr�t� le gentleman parce que son devoir lui
commandait de l'arr�ter, f�t-il coupable ou non. La justice en
d�ciderait.

Mais alors une pens�e vint � Passepartout, cette pens�e terrible qu'il
�tait d�cid�ment la cause de tout ce malheur ! En effet, pourquoi
avait il cach� cette aventure � Mr. Fogg ? Quand Fix avait r�v�l� et
sa qualit� d'inspecteur de police et la mission dont il �tait charg�,
pourquoi avait-il pris sur lui de ne point avertir son ma�tre ?
Celui-ci, pr�venu, aurait sans doute donn� � Fix des preuves de son
innocence ; il lui aurait d�montr� son erreur ; en tout cas, il n'e�t
pas v�hicul� � ses frais et � ses trousses ce malencontreux agent,
dont le premier soin avait �t� de l'arr�ter, au moment o� il mettait
le pied sur le sol du Royaume-Uni. En songeant � ses fautes, � ses
imprudences, le pauvre gar�on �tait pris d'irr�sistibles remords. Il
pleurait, il faisait peine � voir. Il voulait se briser la t�te !

Mrs. Aouda et lui �taient rest�s, malgr� le froid, sous le p�ristyle
de la douane. Ils ne voulaient ni l'un ni l'autre quitter la place.
Ils voulaient revoir encore une fois Mr. Fogg.

Quant � ce gentleman, il �tait bien et d�ment ruin�, et cela au moment
o� il allait atteindre son but. Cette arrestation le perdait sans
retour. Arriv� � midi moins vingt � Liverpool, le 21 d�cembre, il
avait jusqu'� huit heures quarante-cinq minutes pour se pr�senter au
Reform-Club, soit neuf heures quinze minutes, -- et il ne lui en
fallait que six pour atteindre Londres.

En ce moment, qui e�t p�n�tr� dans le poste de la douane e�t trouv�
Mr. Fogg, immobile, assis sur un banc de bois, sans col�re,
imperturbable. R�sign�, on n'e�t pu le dire, mais ce dernier coup
n'avait pu l'�mouvoir, au moins en apparence. S'�tait-il form� en lui
une de ces rages secr�tes, terribles parce qu'elles sont contenues, et
qui n'�clatent qu'au dernier moment avec une force irr�sistible ? On
ne sait. Mais Phileas Fogg �tait l�, calme, attendant... quoi ?
Conservait-il quelque espoir ? Croyait-il encore au succ�s, quand la
porte de cette prison �tait ferm�e sur lui ?

Quoi qu'il en soit, Mr. Fogg avait soigneusement pos� sa montre sur
une table et il en regardait les aiguilles marcher. Pas une parole ne
s'�chappait de ses l�vres, mais son regard avait une fixit�
singuli�re.

En tout cas, la situation �tait terrible, et, pour qui ne pouvait lire
dans cette conscience, elle se r�sumait ainsi :

Honn�te homme, Phileas Fogg �tait ruin�.

Malhonn�te homme, il �tait pris.

Eut-il alors la pens�e de se sauver ? Songea-t-il � chercher si ce
poste pr�sentait une issue praticable ? Pensa-t-il � fuir ? On
serait tent� de le croire, car, � un certain moment, il fit le tour de
la chambre. Mais la porte �tait solidement ferm�e et la fen�tre
garnie de barreaux de fer. Il vint donc se rasseoir, et il tira de
son portefeuille l'itin�raire du voyage. Sur la ligne qui portait ces
mots :

� 21 d�cembre, samedi, Liverpool �, il ajouta :

� 80e jour, 11 h 40 du matin �, et il attendit.

Une heure sonna � l'horloge de Custom-house. Mr. Fogg constata que
sa montre avan�ait de deux minutes sur cette horloge.

Deux heures ! En admettant qu'il mont�t en ce moment dans un express,
il pouvait encore arriver � Londres et au Reform-Club avant huit
heures quarante-cinq du soir. Son front se plissa l�g�rement...

A deux heures trente-trois minutes, un bruit retentit au-dehors, un
vacarme de portes qui s'ouvraient. On entendait la voix de
Passepartout, on entendait la voix de Fix.

Le regard de Phileas Fogg brilla un instant.

La porte du poste s'ouvrit, et il vit Mrs. Aouda, Passepartout, Fix,
qui se pr�cipit�rent vers lui.

Fix �tait hors d'haleine, les cheveux en d�sordre... Il ne pouvait
parler !

� Monsieur, balbutia-t-il, monsieur... pardon... une ressemblance
d�plorable... Voleur arr�t� depuis trois jours... vous...
libre !... �

Phileas Fogg �tait libre ! Il alla au d�tective. Il le regarda bien
en face, et, faisant le seul mouvement rapide qu'il e�t jamais fait
e�t qu'il d�t jamais faire de sa vie, il ramena ses deux bras en
arri�re, puis, avec la pr�cision d'un automate, il frappa de ses deux
poings le malheureux inspecteur.

� Bien tap�! � s'�cria Passepartout, qui, se permettant un atroce jeu
de mots, bien digne d'un Fran�ais, ajouta : � Pardieu voil� ce qu'on
peut appeler une belle application de poings d'Angleterre ! �

Fix, renvers�, ne pronon�a pas un mot. Il n'avait que ce qu'il
m�ritait. Mais aussit�t Mr, Fogg, Mrs. Aouda, Passepartout
quitt�rent la douane. Ils se jet�rent dans une voiture, et, en
quelques minutes, ils arriv�rent � la gare de Liverpool.

Phileas Fogg demanda s'il y avait un express pr�t � partir pour
Londres...

Il �tait deux heures quarante... L'express �tait parti depuis
trente-cinq minutes.

Phileas Fogg commanda alors un train sp�cial.

Il y avait plusieurs locomotives de grande vitesse en pression ; mais,
attendu les exigences du service, le train sp�cial ne put quitter la
gare avant trois heures.

A trois heures, Phileas Fogg, apr�s avoir dit quelques mots au
m�canicien d'une certaine prime � gagner, filait dans la direction de
Londres, en compagnie de la jeune femme et de son fid�le serviteur.

Il fallait franchir en cinq heures et demie la distance qui s�pare
Liverpool de Londres --, chose tr�s faisable, quand la voie est libre
sur tout le parcours. Mais il y eut des retards forc�s, et, quand le
gentleman arriva � la gare, neuf heures moins dix sonnaient � toutes
les horloges de Londres.

Phileas Fogg, apr�s avoir accompli ce voyage autour du monde, arrivait
avec un retard de cinq minutes !...

Il avait perdu.

              DEUX FOIS L'ORDRE QUE SON MA�TRE LUI DONNE

Le lendemain, les habitants de Saville-row auraient �t� bien surpris,
si on leur e�t affirm� que Mr. Fogg avait r�int�gr� son domicile.
Portes et fen�tres, tout �tait clos. Aucun changement ne s'�tait
produit � l'ext�rieur.

En effet, apr�s avoir quitt� la gare, Phileas Fogg avait donn� �
Passepartout l'ordre d'acheter quelques provisions, et il �tait rentr�
dans sa maison.

Ce gentleman avait re�u avec son impassibilit� habituelle le coup qui
le frappait. Ruin� ! et par la faute de ce maladroit inspecteur de
police ! Apr�s avoir march� d'un pas s�r pendant ce long parcours,
apr�s avoir renvers� mille obstacles, brav� mille dangers, ayant
encore trouv� le temps de faire quelque bien sur sa route, �chouer au
port devant un fait brutal, qu'il ne pouvait pr�voir, et contre lequel
il �tait d�sarm� : cela �tait terrible ! De la somme consid�rable
qu'il avait emport�e au d�part, il ne lui restait qu'un reliquat
insignifiant. Sa fortune ne se composait plus que des vingt mille
livres d�pos�es chez Baring fr�res, et ces vingt mille livres, il les
devait � ses coll�gues du Reform-Club. Apr�s tant de d�penses faites,
ce pari gagn� ne l'e�t pas enrichi sans doute, et il est probable
qu'il n'avait pas cherch� � s'enrichir -- �tant de ces hommes qui
parient pour l'honneur --, mais ce pari perdu le ruinait totalement.
Au surplus, le parti du gentleman �tait pris. Il savait ce qui lui
restait � faire.

Une chambre de la maison de Saville-row avait �t� r�serv�e � Mrs.
Aouda. La jeune femme �tait d�sesp�r�e. A certaines paroles
prononc�es par Mr. Fogg, elle avait compris que celui-ci m�ditait
quelque projet funeste.

On sait, en effet, � quelles d�plorables extr�mit�s se portent
quelquefois ces Anglais monomanes sous la pression d'une id�e fixe.
Aussi Passepartout, sans en avoir l'air, surveillait-il son ma�tre.

Mais, tout d'abord, l'honn�te gar�on �tait mont� dans sa chambre et
avait �teint le bec qui br�lait depuis quatre-vingts jours. Il avait
trouv� dans la bo�te aux lettres une note de la Compagnie du gaz, et
il pensa qu'il �tait plus que temps d'arr�ter ces frais dont il �tait
responsable.

La nuit se passa. Mr. Fogg s'�tait couch�, mais avait-il dormi ?
Quant � Mrs. Aouda, elle ne put prendre un seul instant de repos.
Passepartout, lui, avait veill� comme un chien � la porte de son
ma�tre.

Le lendemain, Mr. Fogg le fit venir et lui recommanda, en termes fort
brefs, de s'occuper du d�jeuner de Mrs. Aouda. Pour lui, il se
contenterait d'une tasse de th� et d'une r�tie. Mrs. Aouda voudrait
bien l'excuser pour le d�jeuner et le d�ner, car tout son temps �tait
consacr� � mettre ordre � ses affaires. Il ne descendrait pas. Le
soir seulement, il demanderait � Mrs. Aouda la permission de
l'entretenir pendant quelques instants.

Passepartout, ayant communication du programme de la journ�e, n'avait
plus qu'� s'y conformer. Il regardait son ma�tre toujours impassible,
et il ne pouvait se d�cider � quitter sa chambre. Son coeur �tait
gros, sa conscience bourrel�e de remords, car il s'accusait plus que
jamais de cet irr�parable d�sastre. Oui ! s'il e�t pr�venu Mr.
Fogg, s'il lui e�t d�voil� les projets de l'agent Fix, Mr. Fogg
n'aurait certainement pas tra�n� l'agent Fix jusqu'� Liverpool, et
alors...

Passepartout ne put plus y tenir.

� Mon ma�tre ! monsieur Fogg ! s'�cria-t-il, maudissez-moi. C'est
par ma faute que...

-- Je n'accuse personne, r�pondit Phileas Fogg du ton le plus calme.
Allez. �

Passepartout quitta la chambre et vint trouver la jeune femme, �
laquelle il fit conna�tre les intentions de son ma�tre.

� Madame, ajouta-t-il, je ne puis rien par moi-m�me, rien ! Je n'ai
aucune influence sur l'esprit de mon ma�tre. Vous, peut-�tre...

-- Quelle influence aurais-je, r�pondit Mrs. Aouda. Mr. Fogg n'en
subit aucune ! A-t-il jamais compris que ma reconnaissance pour lui
�tait pr�te � d�border ! A-t-il jamais lu dans mon coeur !... Mon
ami, il ne faudra pas le quitter, pas un seul instant. Vous dites
qu'il a manifest� l'intention de me parler ce soir ?

-- Oui, madame. Il s'agit sans doute de sauvegarder votre situation
en Angleterre.

-- Attendons �, r�pondit la jeune femme, qui demeura toute pensive.

Ainsi, pendant cette journ�e du dimanche, la maison de Saville-row fut
comme si elle e�t �t� inhabit�e, et, pour la premi�re fois depuis
qu'il demeurait dans cette maison, Phileas Fogg n'alla pas � son club,
quand onze heures et demie sonn�rent � la tour du Parlement.

Et pourquoi ce gentleman se f�t-il pr�sent� au Reform-Club ? Ses
coll�gues ne l'y attendaient plus. Puisque, la veille au soir, �
cette date fatale du samedi 21 d�cembre, � huit heures quarante-cinq,
Phileas Fogg n'avait pas paru dans le salon du Reform-Club, son pari
�tait perdu. Il n'�tait m�me pas n�cessaire qu'il all�t chez son
banquier pour y prendre cette somme de vingt mille livres. Ses
adversaires avaient entre les mains un ch�que sign� de lui, et il
suffisait d'une simple �criture � passer chez Baring fr�res, pour que
les vingt mille livres fussent port�es � leur cr�dit.

Mr. Fogg n'avait donc pas � sortir, et il ne sortit pas. Il demeura
dans sa chambre et mit ordre � ses affaires. Passepartout ne cessa de
monter et de descendre l'escalier de la maison de Saville-row. Les
heures ne marchaient pas pour ce pauvre gar�on. Il �coutait � la
porte de la chambre de son ma�tre, et, ce faisant, il ne pensait pas
commettre la moindre indiscr�tion ! Il regardait par le trou de la
serrure, et il s'imaginait avoir ce droit ! Passepartout redoutait �
chaque instant quelque catastrophe. Parfois, il songeait � Fix, mais
un revirement s'�tait fait dans son esprit. Il n'en voulait plus �
l'inspecteur de police. Fix s'�tait tromp� comme tout le monde �
l'�gard de Phileas Fogg, et, en le filant, en l'arr�tant, il n'avait
fait que son devoir, tandis que lui... Cette pens�e l'accablait, et
il se tenait pour le dernier des mis�rables.

Quand, enfin, Passepartout se trouvait trop malheureux d'�tre seul, il
frappait � la porte de Mrs. Aouda, il entrait dans sa chambre, il
s'asseyait dans un coin sans mot dire, et il regardait la jeune femme
toujours pensive.

Vers sept heures et demie du soir, Mr. Fogg fit demander � Mrs.
Aouda si elle pouvait le recevoir, et quelques instants apr�s, la
jeune femme et lui �taient seuls dans cette chambre.

Phileas Fogg prit une chaise et s'assit pr�s de la chemin�e, en face
de Mrs. Aouda. Son visage ne refl�tait aucune �motion. Le Fogg du
retour �tait exactement le Fogg du d�part. M�me calme, m�me
impassibilit�.

Il resta sans parler pendant cinq minutes. Puis levant les yeux sur
Mrs. Aouda :

� Madame, dit-il, me pardonnerez-vous de vous avoir amen�e en
Angleterre ?

-- Moi, monsieur Fogg !... r�pondit Mrs. Aouda, en comprimant les
battements de son coeur.

-- Veuillez me permettre d'achever, reprit Mr. Fogg. Lorsque j'eus
la pens�e de vous entra�ner loin de cette contr�e, devenue si
dangereuse pour vous, j'�tais riche, et je comptais mettre une partie
de ma fortune � votre disposition. Votre existence e�t �t� heureuse
et libre. Maintenant, je suis ruin�.

-- Je le sais, monsieur Fogg, r�pondit la jeune femme, et je vous
demanderai � mon tour : Me pardonnerez-vous de vous avoir suivi, et --
qui sait ? -- d'avoir peut-�tre, en vous retardant, contribu� � votre
ruine ?

-- Madame, vous ne pouviez rester dans l'Inde, et votre salut n'�tait
assur� que si vous vous �loigniez assez pour que ces fanatiques ne
pussent vous reprendre.

-- Ainsi, monsieur Fogg, reprit Mrs. Aouda, non content de m'arracher
� une mort horrible, vous vous croyiez encore oblig� d'assurer ma
position � l'�tranger ?

-- Oui, madame, r�pondit Fogg, mais les �v�nements ont tourn� contre
moi. Cependant, du peu qui me reste, je vous demande la permission de
disposer en votre faveur.

-- Mais, vous, monsieur Fogg, que deviendrez-vous ? demanda Mrs.
Aouda.

-- Moi, madame, r�pondit froidement le gentleman, je n'ai besoin de
rien.

-- Mais comment, monsieur, envisagez-vous donc le sort qui vous
attend ?

-- Comme il convient de le faire, r�pondit Mr. Fogg.

-- En tout cas, reprit Mrs. Aouda, la mis�re ne saurait atteindre un
homme tel que vous. Vos amis...

-- Je n'ai point d'amis, madame.

-- Vos parents...

-- Je n'ai plus de parents.

-- Je vous plains alors, monsieur Fogg, car l'isolement est une triste
chose. Quoi ! pas un coeur pour y verser vos peines. On dit
cependant qu'� deux la mis�re elle-m�me est supportable encore !

-- On le dit, madame.

-- Monsieur Fogg, dit alors Mrs. Aouda, qui se leva
et tendit sa main au gentleman, voulez-vous � la fois d'une parente et
d'une amie ? Voulez-vous de moi pour votre femme ? �

Mr. Fogg, � cette parole, s'�tait lev� � son tour. Il y avait comme
un reflet inaccoutum� dans ses yeux, comme un tremblement sur ses
l�vres. Mrs. Aouda le regardait. La sinc�rit�, la droiture, la
fermet� et la douceur de ce beau regard d'une noble femme qui ose tout
pour sauver celui auquel elle doit tout, l'�tonn�rent d'abord, puis le
p�n�tr�rent. Il ferma les yeux un instant, comme pour �viter que ce
regard ne s'enfon��t plus avant... Quand il les rouvrit :

� Je vous aime ! dit-il simplement. Oui, en v�rit�, par tout ce qu'il
y a de plus sacr� au monde, je vous aime, et je suis tout � vous !

-- Ah !... � s'�cria Mrs. Aouda, en portant la main � son coeur.

Passepartout fut sonn�. Il arriva aussit�t. Mr. Fogg tenait encore
dans sa main la main de Mrs. Aouda. Passepartout comprit, et sa
large face rayonna comme le soleil au z�nith des r�gions tropicales.

Mr. Fogg lui demanda s'il ne serait pas trop tard pour aller pr�venir
le r�v�rend Samuel Wilson, de la paroisse de Mary-le-Bone.

Passepartout sourit de son meilleur sourire.

� Jamais trop tard �, dit-il.

Il n'�tait que huit heures cinq.

� Ce serait pour demain, lundi ! dit-il.

-- Pour demain lundi ? demanda Mr. Fogg en regardant la jeune femme.

-- Pour demain lundi ! � r�pondit Mrs. Aouda. Passepartout sortit,
tout courant.

                                XXXVI
                         --------------------
               DANS LEQUEL PHILEAS FOGG FAIT DE NOUVEAU
                         PRIME SUR LE MARCH�

Il est temps de dire ici quel revirement de l'opinion s'�tait produit
dans le Royaume-Uni, quand on apprit l'arrestation du vrai voleur de
la Banque un certain James Strand -- qui avait eu lieu le 17 d�cembre,
� Edimbourg.

Trois jours avant, Phileas Fogg �tait un criminel que la police
poursuivait � outrance, et maintenant c'�tait le plus honn�te
gentleman, qui accomplissait math�matiquement son excentrique voyage
autour du monde.

Quel effet, quel bruit dans les journaux ! Tous les parieurs pour ou
contre, qui avaient d�j� oubli� cette affaire, ressuscit�rent comme
par magie. Toutes les transactions redevenaient valables. Tous les
engagements revivaient, et, il faut le dire, les paris reprirent avec
une nouvelle �nergie. Le nom de Phileas Fogg fit de nouveau prime sur
le march�.

Les cinq coll�gues du gentleman, au Reform-Club, pass�rent ces trois
jours dans une certaine inqui�tude. Ce Phileas Fogg qu'ils avaient
oubli� reparaissait � leurs yeux ! O� �tait-il en ce moment ? Le 17
d�cembre --, jour o� James Strand fut arr�t� --, il y avait
soixante-seize jours que Phileas Fogg �tait parti, et pas une nouvelle
de lui ! Avait-il succomb� ? Avait-il renonc� � la lutte, ou
continuait il sa marche suivant l'itin�raire convenu ? Et le samedi
21 d�cembre, � huit heures quarante-cinq du soir, allait-il
appara�tre, comme le dieu de l'exactitude, sur le seuil du salon du
Reform-Club ?

Il faut renoncer � peindre l'anxi�t� dans laquelle, pendant trois
jours, v�cut tout ce monde de la soci�t� anglaise. On lan�a des
d�p�ches en Am�rique, en Asie, pour avoir des nouvelles de Phileas
Fogg ! On envoya matin et soir observer la maison de Saville-row,..
Rien. La police elle-m�me ne savait plus ce qu'�tait devenu le
d�tective Fix, qui s'�tait si malencontreusement jet� sur une fausse
piste. Ce qui n'emp�cha pas les paris de s'engager de nouveau sur une
plus vaste �chelle. Phileas Fogg, comme un cheval de course, arrivait
au dernier tournant. On ne le cotait plus � cent, mais � vingt, mais
� dix, mais � cinq, et le vieux paralytique, Lord Albermale, le
prenait, lui, � �galit�.

Aussi, le samedi soir, y avait-il foule dans Pall-Mall et dans les
rues voisines. On e�t dit un immense attroupement de courtiers,
�tablis en permanence aux abords du Reform-Club. La circulation �tait
emp�ch�e. On discutait, on disputait, on criait les cours du �
Phileas Fogg �, comme ceux des fonds anglais. Les policemen avaient
beaucoup de peine � contenir le populaire, et � mesure que s'avan�ait
l'heure � laquelle devait arriver Phileas Fogg, l'�motion prenait des
proportions invraisemblables.

Ce soir-l�, les cinq coll�gues du gentleman �taient r�unis depuis neuf
heures dans le grand salon du Reform-Club. Les deux banquiers, John
Sullivan et Samuel Fallentin, l'ing�nieur Andrew Stuart, Gauthier
Ralph, administrateur de la Banque d'Angleterre, le brasseur Thomas
Flanagan, tous attendaient avec anxi�t�.

Au moment o� l'horloge du grand salon marqua huit heures vingt-cinq,
Andrew Stuart, se levant, dit :

� Messieurs, dans vingt minutes, le d�lai convenu entre Mr. Phileas
Fogg et nous sera expir�.

-- A quelle heure est arriv� le dernier train de Liverpool ? demanda
Thomas Flanagan.

-- A sept heures vingt-trois, r�pondit Gauthier Ralph, et le train
suivant n'arrive qu'� minuit dix.

-- Eh bien, messieurs, reprit Andrew Stuart, si Phileas Fogg �tait
arriv� par le train de sept heures vingt-trois, il serait d�j� ici.
Nous pouvons donc consid�rer le pari comme gagn�.

-- Attendons, ne nous pronon�ons pas, r�pondit Samuel Fallentin. Vous
voyez que notre coll�gue est un excentrique de premier ordre. Son
exactitude en tout est bien connue. Il n'arrive jamais ni trop tard
ni trop t�t, et il appara�trait ici � la derni�re minute, que je n'en
serais pas autrement surpris.

-- Et moi, dit Andrew Stuart, qui �tait, comme toujours, tr�s nerveux,
je le verrais je n'y croirais pas.

-- En effet, reprit Thomas Flanagan, le projet de Phileas Fogg �tait
insens�. Quelle que f�t son exactitude, il ne pouvait emp�cher des
retards in�vitables de se produire, et un retard de deux ou trois
jours seulement suffisait � compromettre son voyage.

-- Vous remarquerez, d'ailleurs, ajouta John Sullivan, que nous
n'avons re�u aucune nouvelle de notre coll�gue et cependant, les fils
t�l�graphiques ne manquaient pas sur son itin�raire.

-- Il a perdu, messieurs, reprit Andrew Stuart, il a cent fois perdu !
Vous savez, d'ailleurs, que le _China_ -- le seul paquebot de New York
qu'il p�t prendre pour venir � Liverpool en temps utile -- est arriv�
hier. Or, voici la liste des passagers, publi�e par la _Shipping
Gazette_, et le nom de Phileas Fogg n'y figure pas. En admettant les
chances les plus favorables, notre coll�gue est � peine en Am�rique !
J'estime � vingt jours, au moins, le retard qu'il subira sur la date
convenue, et le vieux Lord Albermale en sera, lui aussi, pour ses cinq
mille livres !

-- C'est �vident, r�pondit Gauthier Ralph, et demain nous n'aurons
qu'� pr�senter chez Baring fr�res le ch�que de Mr. Fogg �.

En ce moment l'horloge du salon sonna huit heures quarante.

� Encore cinq minutes �, dit Andrew Stuart.

Les cinq coll�gues se regardaient. On peut croire que les battements
de leur coeur avaient subi une l�g�re acc�l�ration, car enfin, m�me
pour de beaux joueurs, la partie �tait forte ! Mais ils n'en
voulaient rien laisser para�tre, car, sur la proposition de Samuel
Fallentin, ils prirent place � une table de jeu.

� Je ne donnerais pas ma part de quatre mille livres dans le pari, dit
Andrew Stuart en s'asseyant, quand m�me on m'en offrirait trois mille
neuf cent quatre-vingt-dix-neuf ! �

L'aiguille marquait, en ce moment, huit heures quarante-deux minutes.

Les joueurs avaient pris les cartes, mais, � chaque instant, leur
regard se fixait sur l'horloge. On peut affirmer que, quelle que f�t
leur s�curit�, jamais minutes ne leur avaient paru si longues !

� Huit heures quarante-trois �, dit Thomas Flanagan, en coupant le jeu
que lui pr�sentait Gauthier Ralph.

Puis un moment de silence se fit. Le vaste salon du club �tait
tranquille. Mais, au-dehors, on entendait le brouhaha de la foule,
que dominaient parfois des cris aigus. Le balancier de l'horloge
battait la seconde avec une r�gularit� math�matique. Chaque joueur
pouvait compter les divisions sexag�simales qui frappaient son
oreille.

� Huit heures quarante-quatre ! � dit John Sullivan d'une voix dans
laquelle on sentait une �motion involontaire.

Plus qu'une minute, et le pari �tait gagn�. Andrew Stuart et ses
coll�gues ne jouaient plus. Ils avaient abandonn� les cartes ! Ils
comptaient les secondes !

A la quaranti�me seconde, rien. A la cinquanti�me, rien encore !

A la cinquante-cinqui�me, on entendit comme un tonnerre au-dehors, des
applaudissements, des hurrahs, et m�me des impr�cations, qui se
propag�rent dans un roulement continu.

Les joueurs se lev�rent.

A la cinquante-septi�me seconde, la porte du salon s'ouvrit, et le
balancier n'avait pas battu la soixanti�me seconde, que Phileas Fogg
apparaissait, suivi d'une foule en d�lire qui avait forc� l'entr�e du
club, et de sa voix calme :

� Me voici, messieurs �, disait-il.

                                XXXVII
                         --------------------
         DANS LEQUEL IL EST PROUV� QUE PHILEAS FOGG N'A RIEN
        GAGN� A FAIRE CE TOUR DU MONDE, SI CE N'EST LE BONHEUR

Oui ! Phileas Fogg en personne.

On se rappelle qu'� huit heures cinq du soir -- vingt-cinq heures
environ apr�s l'arriv�e des voyageurs � Londres --, Passepartout avait
�t� charg� par son ma�tre de pr�venir le r�v�rend Samuel Wilson au
sujet d'un certain mariage qui devait se conclure le lendemain m�me.

Passepartout �tait donc parti, enchant�. Il se rendit d'un pas rapide
� la demeure du r�v�rend Samuel Wilson, qui n'�tait pas encore rentr�.
Naturellement, Passepartout attendit, mais il attendit vingt bonnes
minutes au moins.

Bref, il �tait huit heures trente-cinq quand il sortit de la maison du
r�v�rend. Mais dans quel �tat ! Les cheveux en d�sordre, sans
chapeau, courant, courant, comme on n'a jamais vu courir de m�moire
d'homme, renversant les passants, se pr�cipitant comme une trombe sur
les trottoirs !

En trois minutes, il �tait de retour � la maison de Saville-row, et il
tombait, essouffl�, dans la chambre de Mr. Fogg.

Il ne pouvait parler.

� Qu'y a-t-il ? demanda Mr. Fogg.

-- Mon ma�tre... balbutia Passepartout... mariage... impossible.

-- Impossible ?

-- Impossible... pour demain.

-- Pourquoi ?

-- Parce que demain... c'est dimanche !

-- Lundi, r�pondit Mr. Fogg.

-- Non... aujourd'hui... samedi.

-- Samedi ? impossible !

-- Si, si, si, si ! s'�cria Passepartout. Vous vous �tes tromp� d'un
jour ! Nous sommes arriv�s vingt-quatre heures en avance... mais il
ne reste plus que dix minutes !... �

Passepartout avait saisi son ma�tre au collet, et il l'entra�nait avec
une force irr�sistible !

Phileas Fogg, ainsi enlev�, sans avoir le temps de r�fl�chir, quitta
sa chambre, quitta sa maison, sauta dans un cab, promit cent livres au
cocher, et apr�s avoir �cras� deux chiens et accroch� cinq voitures,
il arriva au Reform-Club.

L'horloge marquait huit heures quarante-cinq, quand il parut dans le
grand salon...

Phileas Fogg avait accompli ce tour du monde en quatre-vingts
jours !...

Phileas Fogg avait gagn� son pari de vingt mille livres !

Et maintenant, comment un homme si exact, si m�ticuleux, avait-il pu
commettre cette erreur de jour ? Comment se croyait-il au samedi
soir, 21 d�cembre, quand il d�barqua � Londres, alors qu'il n'�tait
qu'au vendredi, 20 d�cembre, soixante dix neuf jours seulement apr�s
son d�part ?

Voici la raison de cette erreur. Elle est fort simple.

Phileas Fogg avait, � sans s'en douter �, gagn� un jour sur son
itin�raire, -- et cela uniquement parce qu'il avait fait le tour du
monde en allant vers l'_est_, et il e�t, au contraire, perdu ce jour
en allant en sens inverse, soit vers l'_ouest_.

En effet, en marchant vers l'est, Phileas Fogg allait au-devant du
soleil, et, par cons�quent les jours diminuaient pour lui d'autant de
fois quatre minutes qu'il franchissait de degr�s dans cette direction.
Or, on compte trois cent soixante degr�s sur la circonf�rence
terrestre, et ces trois cent soixante degr�s, multipli�s par quatre
minutes, donnent pr�cis�ment vingt-quatre heures, -- c'est-�-dire ce
jour inconsciemment gagn�. En d'autres termes, pendant que Phileas
Fogg, marchant vers l'est, voyait le soleil passer _quatre-vingts
fois_ au m�ridien, ses coll�gues rest�s � Londres ne le voyaient
passer que _soixante-dix-neuf fois_. C'est pourquoi, ce jour-l� m�me,
qui �tait le samedi et non le dimanche, comme le croyait Mr. Fogg,
ceux-ci l'attendaient dans le salon du Reform-Club.

Et c'est ce que la fameuse montre de Passepartout -- qui avait
toujours conserv� l'heure de Londres -- e�t constat� si, en m�me temps
que les minutes et les heures, elle e�t marqu� les jours !

Phileas Fogg avait donc gagn� les vingt mille livres. Mais comme il
en avait d�pens� en route environ dix-neuf mille, le r�sultat
p�cuniaire �tait m�diocre. Toutefois, on l'a dit, l'excentrique
gentleman n'avait, en ce pari, cherch� que la lutte, non la fortune.
Et m�me, les mille livres restant, il les partagea entre l'honn�te
Passepartout et le malheureux Fix, auquel il �tait incapable d'en
vouloir. Seulement, et pour la r�gularit�, il retint � son serviteur
le prix des dix-neuf cent vingt heures de gaz d�pens� par sa faute.

Ce soir-l� m�me, Mr. Fogg, aussi impassible, aussi flegmatique,
disait � Mrs. Aouda :

� Ce mariage vous convient-il toujours, madame ?

-- Monsieur Fogg, r�pondit Mrs. Aouda, c'est � moi de vous faire
cette question. Vous �tiez ruin�, vous voici riche...

-- Pardonnez-moi, madame, cette fortune vous appartient. Si vous
n'aviez pas eu la pens�e de ce mariage, mon domestique ne serait pas
all� chez le r�v�rend Samuel Wilson, je n'aurais pas �t� averti de mon
erreur, et...

-- Cher monsieur Fogg..., dit la jeune femme.

-- Ch�re Aouda... �, r�pondit Phileas Fogg.

On comprend bien que le mariage se fit quarante-huit heures plus tard,
et Passepartout, superbe, resplendissant, �blouissant, y figura comme
t�moin de la jeune femme. Ne l'avait-il pas sauv�e, et ne lui
devait-on pas cet honneur ?

Seulement, le lendemain, d�s l'aube, Passepartout frappait avec fracas
� la porte de son ma�tre.

La porte s'ouvrit, et l'impassible gentleman parut.

� Qu'y a-t-il, Passepartout ?

-- Ce qu'il y a, monsieur ! Il y a que je viens d'apprendre �
l'instant...

-- Quoi donc ?

-- Que nous pouvions faire le tour du monde en soixante-dix-huit jours
seulement.

-- Sans doute, r�pondit Mr. Fogg, en ne traversant pas l'Inde. Mais
si je n'avais pas travers� l'Inde, je n'aurais pas sauv� Mrs. Aouda,
elle ne serait pas ma femme, et... �

Et Mr. Fogg ferma tranquillement la porte.

Ainsi donc Phileas Fogg avait gagn� son pari. Il avait accompli en
quatre-vingts jours ce voyage autour du monde ! Il avait employ� pour
ce faire tous les moyens de transport, paquebots, railways, voitures,
yachts, b�timents de commerce, tra�neaux, �l�phant. L'excentrique
gentleman avait d�ploy� dans cette affaire ses merveilleuses qualit�s
de sang-froid et d'exactitude. Mais apr�s ? Qu'avait-il gagn� � ce
d�placement ? Qu'avait-il rapport� de ce voyage ?

Rien, dira-t-on ? Rien, soit, si ce n'est une charmante femme, qui --
quelque invraisemblable que cela puisse para�tre -- le rendit le plus
heureux des hommes !

En v�rit�, ne ferait-on pas, pour moins que cela, le Tour du Monde ?
