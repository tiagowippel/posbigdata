Book 56        Titus

56:001:001 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
           according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging
           of the truth which is after godliness;

56:001:002 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised
           before the world began;

56:001:003 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching,
           which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God
           our Saviour;

56:001:004 To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy,
           and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our
           Saviour.

56:001:005 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set
           in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in
           every city, as I had appointed thee:

56:001:006 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful
           children not accused of riot or unruly.

56:001:007 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
           selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not
           given to filthy lucre;

56:001:008 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just,
           holy, temperate;

56:001:009 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he
           may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince
           the gainsayers.

56:001:010 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
           specially they of the circumcision:

56:001:011 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses,
           teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

56:001:012 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The
           Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

56:001:013 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they
           may be sound in the faith;

56:001:014 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men,
           that turn from the truth.

56:001:015 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are
           defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind
           and conscience is defiled.

56:001:016 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
           being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work
           reprobate.

56:002:001 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:

56:002:002 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith,
           in charity, in patience.

56:002:003 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
           holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers
           of good things;

56:002:004 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
           husbands, to love their children,

56:002:005 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to
           their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

56:002:006 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

56:002:007 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in
           doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,

56:002:008 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the
           contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of
           you.

56:002:009 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
           please them well in all things; not answering again;

56:002:010 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may
           adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

56:002:011 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
           all men,

56:002:012 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
           should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
           world;

56:002:013 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of
           the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

56:002:014 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
           iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous
           of good works.

56:002:015 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
           Let no man despise thee.

56:003:001 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers,
           to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,

56:003:002 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle,
           shewing all meekness unto all men.

56:003:003 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
           deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice
           and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

56:003:004 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward
           man appeared,

56:003:005 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
           according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
           regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

56:003:006 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
           Saviour;

56:003:007 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs
           according to the hope of eternal life.

56:003:008 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
           affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might
           be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and
           profitable unto men.

56:003:009 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions,
           and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and
           vain.

56:003:010 A man that is an heretick after the first and second
           admonition reject;

56:003:011 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being
           condemned of himself.

56:003:012 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent
           to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to
           winter.

56:003:013 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey
           diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.

56:003:014 And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary
           uses, that they be not unfruitful.

56:003:015 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in
           the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
