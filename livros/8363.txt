THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS

St. Paul, having preached the faith in the island of Crete, he ordained
his beloved disciple and companion, Titus, bishop, and left him there to
finish the work which he had begun. Afterwards the Apostle, on a journey
to Nicopolis, a city of Macedonia, wrote this Epistle to Titus, in which
he directs him to ordain bishops and priests for the different cities,
shewing him the principal qualities necessary for a bishop. He also
gives him particular advice for his own conduct to his flock, exhorting
him to hold to strictness of discipline, but seasoned with lenity. It
was written about thirty-three years after our Lord's Ascension.


Titus Chapter 1

What kind of men he is to ordain priests. Some men are to be sharply
rebuked.

1:1. Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to
the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth, which
is according to godliness:

1:2. Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath
promised before the times of the world:

1:3. But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is
committed to me according to the commandment of God our Saviour:

1:4. To Titus, my beloved son according to the common faith, grace and
peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Saviour.

1:5. For this cause I left thee in Crete: that thou shouldest set in
order the things that are wanting and shouldest ordain priests in every
city, as I also appointed thee:

1:6. If any be without crime, the husband of one wife having faithful
children, not accused of riot or unruly.

1:7. For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not
proud, not subject to anger, nor given to wine, no striker, not greedy
of filthy lucre:

1:8. But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:

1:9. Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that
he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to convince the
gainsayers.

1:10. For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers and seducers:
especially they who are of the circumcision.

1:11. Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things
which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

1:12. One of them a prophet of their own, said: The Cretans are always
liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies.

1:13. This testimony is true. Wherefore, rebuke them sharply, that they
may be sound in the faith:

1:14. Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn
themselves away from the truth.

1:15. All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled
and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their
conscience are defiled.

1:16. They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him:
being abominable and incredulous and to every good work reprobate.

Titus Chapter 2

How he is to instruct both old and young. The duty of servants.  The
Christian's rule of life.

2:1. But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine:

2:2. That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in
love, in patience.

2:3. The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers,
not given to much wine, teaching well:

2:4. That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their
husbands, to love their children.

2:5. To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle,
obedient to their husbands: that the word of God be not blasphemed.

2:6. Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober.

2:7. In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in doctrine,
in integrity, in gravity,

2:8. The sound word that can not be blamed: that he who is on the
contrary part may be afraid, having no evil to say of us.

2:9. Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters: in all things
pleasing, not gainsaying:

2:10. Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they
may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

2:11. For the grace of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men:

2:12. Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we
should live soberly and justly and godly in this world,

2:13. Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great
God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.

2:14. Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity
and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good
works.

2:15. These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority.  Let
no man despise thee.

Titus Chapter 3

Other instructions and directions for life and doctrine.

3:1. Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to obey at a
word, to be ready to every good work.

3:2. To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious but gentle: shewing
all mildness towards all men.

3:3. For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring,
slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy,
hateful and hating one another.

3:4. But when the goodness and kindness of God our Saviour appeared:

3:5. Not by the works of justice which we have done, but according to
his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration and renovation of
the Holy Ghost.

3:6. Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ
our Saviour:

3:7. That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs according to
hope of life everlasting.

3:8. It is a faithful saying. And these things I will have thee affirm
constantly, that they who believe in God may be careful to excel in good
works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

3:9. But avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and
strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain.

3:10. A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition,
avoid:

3:11. Knowing that he that is such an one is subverted and sinneth,
being condemned by his own judgment.

By his own judgment... Other offenders are judged, and cast out of the
church, by the sentence of the pastors of the same church.  Heretics,
more unhappy, run out of the church of their own accord, and by doing
so, give judgment and sentence against their own souls.

3:12. When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, make haste to come
unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter.

3:13. Send forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollo, with care that nothing
be wanting to them.

3:14. And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary
uses: that they be not unfruitful.

3:15. All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in the
faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
