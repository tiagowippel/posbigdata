THE NORSK NIGHTINGALE

Being the Lyrics of a "Lumberyack"

By William F. Kirk


1905




PREFACE


It is with a certain amount of misgiving that the author sends out this
little volume of Scandinavian dialect verses. To the residents of
Northern Wisconsin and Minnesota, where the "lumberyack" lives and
thrives, the dialect will seem familiar enough; but to other readers
such terms as "skol" (shall or will), "ban" (been), "panga" (money),
"sum" (than or as), may convey little or no meaning.

But, if the Scandinavian dialect verses are not widely popular, they are
at least comparatively fresh and original; and to those readers who can
readily grasp the patois, as well as to those who are compelled to
struggle painfully through its labyrinths, this volume is respectfully
dedicated.

HIS LYRICS




"YIM"


Dar ban a little faller,
  Ay tenk his name ban Yim,
And nearly every morning
  Ay used to seeing him.
He used to stand in gatevay,
  And call me Svede, and ay
Ant lak to hear dis nickname:
  Ay ban a Norsk, yu say.

But he ban little faller,
  Ay tenk 'bout sax years old,
And so ay used to lak him--
  He ban too small to scold.
Ay used to say, "Val, Yimmie,

Can call me Svede,--ay lak yu
  And ant care vat yu du."

By Yeorge! Ay'm glad, ay tal yu,
  Dat ay ban gude to him,
Because one venter morning
  Ay ant see little Yim.
And next day funeral vagon
  Com driving op to door,
And Yim, poor little faller,
  Can't call me Svede no more!

THE "LUMBERYACK"


"Roll out!" yell cookee

Ve drenk and we sing;
 And calling town faller gude frend,

 But ant got no panga to lend.

OLAF


Yust two years ago last venter

Den our straw boss he skol make us

Sometimes he sing dis har ragtime,

And at night, ven we ban smoking

  Till our belts skol nearly break.

Me and Olaf bunked together,
  And sometimes he taling me
'Bout his vife and little Torger,
  Who ban living cross big sea.
"Ay ban saving dough," say Olaf;
  "And next summer, ef ay can,
Ay skol send for vife and baby;
  Den ay ban a happy man!"

  And his eyes ban gude and damp.

  Close by me, var he skol smoke.

"PEEK-A-BOO"


"Peek-a-boo!" say little Olaf.
  "Yu can't find me. Ay ban hid."

  For my little blue-eyed kid.
Op in attic, down in cellar,
  Back of chairs on parlor floor;
Den he used to laugh, and tal me,
  "Ay ban back of kitchen door."

"Peek-a-boo!" he used to tal me.
  "Shut yure eyes, and don't you peek!"
Den ay feel his arms around me
  And his kisses on my cheek.
"Now ay'm hiding, dad," he tal me!
  "Maybe, ef you look some more,
Yu skol find yure little Olaf--
  Ay ban back of kitchen door."

"Peek-a-boo!" ay hear him calling,
  Lak he called long time ago.
Var ban little Olaf hiding?
  Maybe anyel fallers know.
Tousand times ay look to find him
  Hiding back of kitchen door,
But ay only see some shadows:
  Ay can't find him any more.




SONNET ON STEWED PRUNES


Ay ant lak pie-plant pie so wery vell;
Ven ay skol eat ice-cream, my yaws du ache;

Or crackers yust so dry sum peanut shell.
And ven ay eat dried apples, ay skol svell
Until ay tenk my belt skol nearly break;
And dis har breakfast food, ay tenk, ban fake:

Vith yuice dat taste about lak nice port vine,
Only it ant cost hardly any money,--

A GOOD FELLOW


Dey tal me ay ban a gude faller.

And purty sune yure chance ban tru.
  So, ef yu lak to stack chips high,
Val, Maester, it ban op to yu.

  Who vatch big bridge at night:
It ban gude many years ago,
  Ay ant got date yust right.
Dar ban some foxy geezers
  Who march avay from home,
And tenk they having qvite gude chance
  To raise some hal in Rome.

  Ay tenk Lars ban a Svede;
He raise 'bout tousand soldiers,
  And put himself in lead.
Then he began tu marching,
  And all his frends march, tu,
Till they skol come almost to Rome,
  Var dey skol rest a few.

Then op spake Maester Horatius,
  Captain of dis har gate:
"To every yackass on dis earth
  Death coming sune or late.
So how can ay die better
  Than vatching bridge, yu say?
Now who skol standing on my front
  And vatching bridge vith me?"

Then Maester Laertus Larson,

Say, "Ay skol standing on yure back,
  But not on front, by yee!"
And old Herminius Hermanson--

  Say, "Ay skol taking little smash
    At dese har Svedes vith yu!"

  Novere in whole dam town.

So ven dis bridge start falling,

And yu bet yure life dey vent back, tu,
And put gude crimp in dis Rebel crew.
But soldiers ban careless sons of guns,
And the yeneral never settled for buns.

And yump ven the vash-voman com for her pay.

And ay skol feel dam sleepy,

  Whose songs ban sveet to hear--
Who making, from his poetry,

  Vich follows drenk of rye.
And night skol be full of music,
  And tengs we lak to forget
Skol fold op tents lak yipsies,
  And sneaking avay, yu bet!

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
