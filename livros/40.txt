There are two files (and their zipped counterparts) associated with 
this etext:

40.ps - a Postscript file, intended only for printing to a Postscript
printer.

40-pdf.pdf - a PDF version of the above file, produced with Ghostscript.


A text version of 40.ps was attempted, but it was deemed a failure.
Its lines were unwrapped/unformatted, and there were no blank lines 
between paragraphs.
