Book 14 2 Chronicles
001:001 Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,
        and Yahweh his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.
001:002 Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands
        and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince
        in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' [houses].
001:003 So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place
        that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God,
        which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness.
001:004 But David had brought the ark of God up from Kiriath Jearim
        to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched
        a tent for it at Jerusalem.
001:005 Moreover the bronze altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri,
        the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tent of Yahweh:
        and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there.
001:006 Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh,
        which was at the tent of meeting, and offered one thousand
        burnt offerings on it.
001:007 In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him,
        "Ask what I shall give you."
001:008 Solomon said to God, You have shown great loving kindness
        to David my father, and have made me king in his place.
001:009 Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be established;
        for you have made me king over a people like the dust
        of the earth in multitude.
001:010 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come
        in before this people; for who can judge this your people,
        that is so great?
001:011 God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart,
        and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life
        of those who hate you, neither yet have asked long life;
        but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you
        may judge my people, over whom I have made you king:
001:012 wisdom and knowledge is granted to you; and I will give you riches,
        and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had
        who have been before you; neither shall there any after you
        have the like.
001:013 So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon,
        from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem;
        and he reigned over Israel.
001:014 Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen:  and he had one thousand
        four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed
        in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
001:015 The king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones,
        and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are
        in the lowland, for abundance.
001:016 The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue;
        the king's merchants purchased them from Kue.
001:017 They brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six
        hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty:
        and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria,
        did they bring them out by their means.
002:001 Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Yahweh,
        and a house for his kingdom.
002:002 Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens,
        and eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains,
        and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
002:003 Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As you dealt
        with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house
        in which to dwell, [even so deal with me].
002:004 Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh
        my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him
        incense of sweet spices, and for the continual show bread,
        and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths,
        and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our God.
        This is [an ordinance] forever to Israel.
002:005 The house which I build is great; for great is our God
        above all gods.
002:006 But who is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven
        of heavens can't contain him? who am I then, that I should
        build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?
002:007 Now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver,
        and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue,
        and who knows how to engrave [all manner of] engravings,
        [to be] with the skillful men who are with me in Judah
        and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
002:008 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon;
        for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon:
        and behold, my servants shall be with your servants,
002:009 even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I
        am about to build shall be great and wonderful.
002:010 Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber,
        twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand
        measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine,
        and twenty thousand baths of oil.
002:011 Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent
        to Solomon, "Because Yahweh loves his people, he has made
        you king over them."
002:012 Huram continued, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, that made
        heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son,
        endowed with discretion and understanding, that should build
        a house for Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom.
002:013 Now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding,
        of Huram my father's,
002:014 the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father
        was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver,
        in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple,
        in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave
        any manner of engraving, and to devise any device; that there
        may be a place appointed to him with your skillful men,
        and with the skillful men of my lord David your father.
002:015 Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine,
        which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants:
002:016 and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need;
        and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa;
        and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem."
002:017 Solomon numbered all the foreigners who were in the land
        of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father
        had numbered them; and they were found one hundred fifty-three
        thousand six hundred.
002:018 He set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, and eighty
        thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three
        thousand six hundred overseers to set the people at work.
003:001 Then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem
        on Mount Moriah, where [Yahweh] appeared to David his father,
        which he made ready in the place that David had appointed,
        in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
003:002 He began to build in the second [day] of the second month,
        in the fourth year of his reign.
003:003 Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building
        of the house of God.  The length by cubits after the first
        measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
003:004 The porch that was before [the house], the length of it,
        according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits,
        and the height one hundred twenty; and he overlaid it within
        with pure gold.
003:005 The greater house he made a ceiling with fir wood,
        which he overlaid with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm
        trees and chains.
003:006 He garnished the house with precious stones for beauty:
        and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
003:007 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds,
        and the walls of it, and the doors of it, with gold;
        and engraved cherubim on the walls.
003:008 He made the most holy house:  the length of it, according to
        the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth
        of it twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold,
        amounting to six hundred talents.
003:009 The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold.
        He overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
003:010 In the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work;
        and they overlaid them with gold.
003:011 The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long:
        the wing of the one [cherub] was five cubits, reaching to the wall
        of the house; and the other wing was [likewise] five cubits,
        reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
003:012 The wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall
        of the house; and the other wing was five cubits [also],
        joining to the wing of the other cherub.
003:013 The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits:
        and they stood on their feet, and their faces were
        toward the house.
003:014 He made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen,
        and ornamented it with cherubim.
003:015 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty-five
        cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each
        of them was five cubits.
003:016 He made chains in the oracle, and put [them] on the tops
        of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates,
        and put them on the chains.
003:017 He set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand,
        and the other on the left; and called the name of that on
        the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
004:001 Then he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
        of it, and twenty cubits the breadth of it, and ten cubits
        the height of it.
004:002 Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,
        round in compass; and the height of it was five cubits;
        and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
004:003 Under it was the likeness of oxen, which did compass it
        round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about.
        The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
004:004 It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north,
        and three looking toward the west, and three looking
        toward the south, and three looking toward the east:
        and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder
        parts were inward.
004:005 It was a handbreadth thick; and the brim of it was worked
        like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily:
        it received and held three thousand baths.
004:006 He made also ten basins, and put five on the right hand,
        and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged
        to the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was
        for the priests to wash in.
004:007 He made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance
        concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on
        the right hand, and five on the left.
004:008 He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple,
        five on the right side, and five on the left.  He made one
        hundred basins of gold.
004:009 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court,
        and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
004:010 He set the sea on the right side [of the house] eastward,
        toward the south.
004:011 Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins.
        So Huram made an end of doing the work that he did for king
        Solomon in the house of God:
004:012 the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were
        on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two
        bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,
004:013 and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks;
        two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two
        bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.
004:014 He made also the bases, and the basins made he on the bases;
004:015 one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.
004:016 The pots also, and the shovels, and the forks, and all the vessels
        of it, did Huram his father make for king Solomon for the house
        of Yahweh of bright brass.
004:017 In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
        ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
004:018 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance:
        for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
004:019 Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God,
        the golden altar also, and the tables with the show bread on them;
004:020 and the lampstands with their lamps, to burn according
        to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;
004:021 and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,
        and that perfect gold;
004:022 and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the
        fire pans, of pure gold:  and as for the entry of the house,
        the inner doors of it for the most holy place, and the doors
        of the main hall of the temple were of gold.
005:001 Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yahweh
        was finished.  Solomon brought in the things that David
        his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold,
        and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of
        the house of God.
005:002 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all
        the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers'
        [houses] of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up
        the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David,
        which is Zion.
005:003 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king
        at the feast, which was [in] the seventh month.
005:004 All the elders of Israel came:  and the Levites took up the ark;
005:005 and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting,
        and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did
        the priests the Levites bring up.
005:006 King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were
        assembled to him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen,
        that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
005:007 The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to
        its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place,
        even under the wings of the cherubim.
005:008 For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place
        of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the poles
        of it above.
005:009 The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen
        from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen outside:
        and there it is to this day.
005:010 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put
        [there] at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children
        of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
005:011 It happened, when the priests were come out of the holy place,
        (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves,
        and did not keep their divisions;
005:012 also the Levites who were the singers, all of them,
        even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers,
        arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed instruments
        and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them
        one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets;)
005:013 it happened, when the trumpeters and singers were as one,
        to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Yahweh;
        and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals
        and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh, [saying], For he
        is good; for his loving kindness endures forever; that then
        the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Yahweh,
005:014 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason
        of the cloud:  for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of God.
006:001 Then spoke Solomon, Yahweh has said that he would dwell
        in the thick darkness.
006:002 But I have built you a house of habitation, and a place for you
        to dwell in forever.
006:003 The king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel:
        and all the assembly of Israel stood.
006:004 He said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke
        with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands
        fulfilled it, saying,
006:005 Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land
        of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel
        to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose
        I any man to be prince over my people Israel:
006:006 but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there;
        and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
006:007 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house
        for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
006:008 But Yahweh said to David my father, Whereas it was in your
        heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it
        was in your heart:
006:009 nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who
        shall come forth out of your body, he shall build the house
        for my name.
006:010 Yahweh has performed his word that he spoke; for I am risen up
        in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel,
        as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name
        of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
006:011 There have I set the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh,
        which he made with the children of Israel.
006:012 He stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all
        the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands
006:013 (for Solomon had made a bronze scaffold, five cubits long,
        and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it
        in the midst of the court; and on it he stood, and kneeled
        down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel,
        and spread forth his hands toward heaven;)
006:014 and he said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you,
        in heaven, or on earth; who keep covenant and loving kindness
        with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart;
006:015 who have kept with your servant David my father that which you
        did promise him:  yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have
        fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.
006:016 Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant
        David my father that which you have promised him, saying,
        There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne
        of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way,
        to walk in my law as you have walked before me.
006:017 Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, let your word be verified,
        which you spoke to your servant David.
006:018 But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth?
        Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain you;
        how much less this house which I have built!
006:019 Yet have you respect to the prayer of your servant,
        and to his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry
        and to the prayer which your servant prays before you;
006:020 that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night,
        even toward the place where you have said that you would put
        your name; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall
        pray toward this place.
006:021 Listen to the petitions of your servant, and of your
        people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place:
        yes, hear from your dwelling place, even from heaven;
        and when you hear, forgive.
006:022 If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him
        to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before your
        altar in this house;
006:023 then hear from heaven, and do, and judge your servants,
        bringing retribution to the wicked, to bring his way on his
        own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according
        to his righteousness.
006:024 If your people Israel be struck down before the enemy,
        because they have sinned against you, and shall turn again
        and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before
        you in this house;
006:025 then hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel,
        and bring them again to the land which you gave to them
        and to their fathers.
006:026 When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
        have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place,
        and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you
        do afflict them:
006:027 then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants,
        and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way
        in which they should walk; and send rain on your land,
        which you have given to your people for an inheritance.
006:028 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
        if there is blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar;
        if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities;
        whatever plague or whatever sickness there be;
006:029 whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man,
        or by all your people Israel, who shall know every man his own
        plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands
        toward this house:
006:030 then hear from heaven, your dwelling place and forgive, and render
        to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know;
        (for you, even you only, know the hearts of the children of men;)
006:031 that they may fear you, to walk in your ways, so long as they
        live in the land which you gave to our fathers.
006:032 Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel,
        when he shall come from a far country for your great name's sake,
        and your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm; when they
        shall come and pray toward this house:
006:033 then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place,
        and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for;
        that all the peoples of the earth may know your name,
        and fear you, as does your people Israel, and that they may know
        that this house which I have built is called by your name.
006:034 If your people go out to battle against their enemies,
        by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to you
        toward this city which you have chosen, and the house which I
        have built for your name;
006:035 then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication,
        and maintain their cause.
006:036 If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn't sin),
        and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy,
        so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near;
006:037 yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they
        are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication
        to you in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned,
        we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;
006:038 if they return to you with all their heart and with all
        their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have
        carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which you
        gave to their fathers, and the city which you have chosen,
        and toward the house which I have built for your name:
006:039 then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place,
        their prayer and their petitions, and maintain their cause,
        and forgive your people who have sinned against you.
006:040 Now, my God, let, I beg you, your eyes be open, and let your
        ears be attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place.
006:041 Now therefore arise, Yahweh God, into your resting place,
        you, and the ark of your strength:  let your priests,
        Yahweh God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints
        rejoice in goodness.
006:042 Yahweh God, don't turn away the face of your anointed:
        remember [your] loving kindnesses to David your servant.
007:001 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down
        from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices;
        and the glory of Yahweh filled the house.
007:002 The priests could not enter into the house of Yahweh,
        because the glory of Yahweh filled Yahweh's house.
007:003 All the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down,
        and the glory of Yahweh was on the house; and they bowed
        themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement,
        and worshiped, and gave thanks to Yahweh, [saying], For he is good;
        for his loving kindness endures for ever.
007:004 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Yahweh.
007:005 King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen,
        and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep.  So the king and all
        the people dedicated the house of God.
007:006 The priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites
        also with instruments of music of Yahweh, which David the king
        had made to give thanks to Yahweh, (for his loving kindness
        endures for ever), when David praised by their ministry:
        and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood.
007:007 Moreover Solomon made the middle of the court holy that was before
        the house of Yahweh; for there he offered the burnt offerings,
        and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar
        which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offering,
        and the meal offering, and the fat.
007:008 So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all
        Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance
        of Hamath to the brook of Egypt.
007:009 On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly:
        for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days,
        and the feast seven days.
007:010 On the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent
        the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for
        the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David, and to Solomon,
        and to Israel his people.
007:011 Thus Solomon finished the house of Yahweh, and the king's house:
        and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon's
        heart to make in the house of Yahweh, and in his own house.
007:012 Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him,
        I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place to myself
        for a house of sacrifice.
007:013 If I shut up the sky so that there is no rain, or if I command
        the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence
        among my people;
007:014 if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves,
        and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways;
        then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin,
        and will heal their land.
007:015 Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive, to the prayer
        that is made in this place.
007:016 For now have I chosen and made this house holy, that my
        name may be there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall
        be there perpetually.
007:017 As for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked,
        and do according to all that I have commanded you, and will
        keep my statutes and my ordinances;
007:018 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I
        covenanted with David your father, saying, There shall not
        fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.
007:019 But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments
        which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods,
        and worship them;
007:020 then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I
        have given them; and this house, which I have made holy
        for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it
        a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
007:021 This house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it shall
        be astonished, and shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus
        to this land, and to this house?
007:022 They shall answer, Because they abandoned Yahweh, the God of
        their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,
        and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them:
        therefore has he brought all this evil on them.
008:001 It happened at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had
        built the house of Yahweh, and his own house,
008:002 that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them,
        and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
008:003 Solomon went to Hamath Zobah, and prevailed against it.
008:004 He built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities,
        which he built in Hamath.
008:005 Also he built Beth Horon the upper, and Beth Horon the lower,
        fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
008:006 and Baalath, and all the storage cities that Solomon had,
        and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for
        his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his
        pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land
        of his dominion.
008:007 As for all the people who were left of the Hittites,
        and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites,
        and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel;
008:008 of their children who were left after them in the land,
        whom the children of Israel didn't consume, of them did
        Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day.
008:009 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for
        his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains,
        and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
008:010 These were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two-hundred fifty,
        who ruled over the people.
008:011 Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city
        of David to the house that he had built for her; for he said,
        My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel,
        because the places where the ark of Yahweh has come are holy.
008:012 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar
        of Yahweh, which he had built before the porch,
008:013 even as the duty of every day required, offering according to
        the commandment of Moses, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons,
        and on the set feasts, three times in the year, [even] in
        the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks,
        and in the feast of tents.
008:014 He appointed, according to the ordinance of David
        his father, the divisions of the priests to their service,
        and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister
        before the priests, as the duty of every day required;
        the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate:
        for so had David the man of God commanded.
008:015 They didn't depart from the commandment of the king to the priests
        and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
008:016 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the
        foundation of the house of Yahweh, and until it was finished.
        [So] the house of Yahweh was completed.
008:017 Then went Solomon to Ezion Geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore
        in the land of Edom.
008:018 Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea
        by the hands of his servants; and they came with the servants
        of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from there four hundred
        fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.
009:001 When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon,
        she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem,
        with a very great train, and camels that bore spices,
        and gold in abundance, and precious stones:  and when she
        was come to Solomon, she talked with him of all that was
        in her heart.
009:002 Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything
        hid from Solomon which he didn't tell her.
009:003 When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon,
        and the house that he had built,
009:004 and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
        and the attendance of his ministers, and their clothing,
        his cup bearers also, and their clothing, and his ascent
        by which he went up to the house of Yahweh; there was no more
        spirit in her.
009:005 She said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my
        own land of your acts, and of your wisdom.
009:006 However I didn't believe their words, until I came, and my eyes
        had seen it; and behold, the half of the greatness of your
        wisdom was not told me:  you exceed the fame that I heard.
009:007 Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants,
        who stand continually before you, and hear your wisdom.
009:008 Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you
        on his throne, to be king for Yahweh your God:  because your
        God loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore made
        he you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.
009:009 She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold,
        and spices in great abundance, and precious stones:
        neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave
        to king Solomon.
009:010 The servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought
        gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
009:011 The king made of the algum trees terraces for the house of Yahweh,
        and for the king's house, and harps and stringed instruments
        for the singers:  and there were none like these seen before
        in the land of Judah.
009:012 King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
        whatever she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king.
        So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
009:013 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
        hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
009:014 besides that which the traders and merchants brought:
        and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country
        brought gold and silver to Solomon.
009:015 King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold;
        six hundred [shekels] of beaten gold went to one buckler.
009:016 [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold;
        three hundred [shekels] of gold went to one shield:
        and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
009:017 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
        it with pure gold.
009:018 And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,
        which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either
        side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing
        beside the stays.
009:019 Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on
        the six steps:  there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.
009:020 All king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels
        of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold:
        silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
009:021 For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants
        of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish,
        bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
009:022 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in
        riches and wisdom.
009:023 All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon,
        to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
009:024 They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels
        of gold, and clothing, armor, and spices, horses, and mules,
        a rate year by year.
009:025 Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve
        thousand horsemen, that he stationed in the chariot cities,
        and with the king at Jerusalem.
009:026 He ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land
        of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
009:027 The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones,
        and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are
        in the lowland, for abundance.
009:028 They brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
009:029 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last,
        aren't they written in the history of Nathan the prophet,
        and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions
        of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
009:030 Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
009:031 Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city
        of David his father:  and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
010:001 Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem
        to make him king.
010:002 It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it,
        (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence
        of king Solomon), that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
010:003 They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came,
        and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
010:004 Your father made our yoke grievous:  now therefore make you
        the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke
        which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.
010:005 He said to them, Come again to me after three days.
        The people departed.
010:006 King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before
        Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel
        give you me to return answer to this people?
010:007 They spoke to him, saying, If you are kind to this people,
        and please them, and speak good words to them, then they
        will be your servants forever.
010:008 But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,
        and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him,
        who stood before him.
010:009 He said to them, What counsel give you, that we may return answer
        to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke
        that your father did put on us lighter?
010:010 The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying,
        Thus shall you tell the people who spoke to you, saying,
        Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us;
        thus shall you say to them, My little finger is thicker
        than my father's waist.
010:011 Now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke,
        I will add to your yoke:  my father chastised you with whips,
        but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.
010:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
        as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
010:013 The king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook
        the counsel of the old men,
010:014 and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,
        My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto:
        my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise
        you] with scorpions.
010:015 So the king didn't listen to the people; for it was brought about
        of God, that Yahweh might establish his word, which he spoke
        by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
010:016 When all Israel saw that the king didn't listen to them,
        the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we
        in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse:
        every man to your tents, Israel:  now see to your own house, David.
        So all Israel departed to their tents.
010:017 But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities
        of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
010:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject
        to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him
        to death with stones.  King Rehoboam made speed to get him
        up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
010:019 So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.
011:001 When Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house
        of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen men,
        who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom
        again to Rehoboam.
011:002 But the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
011:003 Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah,
        and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
011:004 Thus says Yahweh, You shall not go up, nor fight against
        your brothers:  return every man to his house; for this
        thing is of me.  So they listened to the words of Yahweh,
        and returned from going against Jeroboam.
011:005 Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.
011:006 He built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
011:007 Beth Zur, and Soco, and Adullam,
011:008 and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
011:009 and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
011:010 and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and
        in Benjamin, fortified cities.
011:011 He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them,
        and stores of food, and oil and wine.
011:012 In every city [he put] shields and spears, and made them
        exceeding strong.  Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.
011:013 The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted
        to him out of all their border.
011:014 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession,
        and came to Judah and Jerusalem:  for Jeroboam and his sons
        cast them off, that they should not execute the priest's
        office to Yahweh;
011:015 and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for
        the male goats, and for the calves which he had made.
011:016 After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their
        hearts to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem
        to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.
011:017 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam
        the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked
        three years in the way of David and Solomon.
011:018 Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth
        the son of David, [and of] Abihail the daughter of Eliab
        the son of Jesse;
011:019 and she bore him sons:  Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.
011:020 After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore
        him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
011:021 Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his
        wives and his concubines:  (for he took eighteen wives,
        and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight
        sons and sixty daughters.)
011:022 Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief,
        [even] the prince among his brothers; for [he was minded]
        to make him king.
011:023 He dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all
        the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city:
        and he gave them food in abundance.  He sought [for
        them] many wives.
012:001 It happened, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established,
        and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Yahweh,
        and all Israel with him.
012:002 It happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak
        king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had
        trespassed against Yahweh,
012:003 with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen.
        The people were without number who came with him out of Egypt:
        the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.
012:004 He took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah,
        and came to Jerusalem.
012:005 Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes
        of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak,
        and said to them, Thus says Yahweh, You have forsaken me,
        therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
012:006 Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves;
        and they said, Yahweh is righteous.
012:007 When Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh
        came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves:
        I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance,
        and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the
        hand of Shishak.
012:008 Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know
        my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
012:009 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,
        and took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh,
        and the treasures of the king's house:  he took all away:
        he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
012:010 King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass,
        and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard,
        who kept the door of the king's house.
012:011 It was so, that as often as the king entered into the house
        of Yahweh, the guard came and bore them, and brought them
        back into the guard chamber.
012:012 When he humbled himself, the wrath of Yahweh turned from him,
        so as not to destroy him altogether:  and moreover in Judah
        there were good things [found].
012:013 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned:
        for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh
        had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there:
        and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
012:014 He did that which was evil, because he didn't set his heart
        to seek Yahweh.
012:015 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, aren't they written
        in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer,
        after the manner of genealogies?  There were wars between
        Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
012:016 Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David:
        and Abijah his son reigned in his place.
013:001 In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to
        reign over Judah.
013:002 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem:  and his mother's
        name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.
        There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
013:003 Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war,
        even four hundred thousand chosen men:  and Jeroboam set
        the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand
        chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.
013:004 Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country
        of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:
013:005 Ought you not to know that Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him
        and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
013:006 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son
        of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.
013:007 There were gathered to him worthless men, base fellows,
        who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon,
        when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could
        not withstand them.
013:008 Now you think to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand
        of the sons of David; and you are a great multitude,
        and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made
        you for gods.
013:009 Haven't you driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron,
        and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner
        of the peoples of [other] lands? so that whoever comes
        to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams,
        the same may be a priest of [those who are] no gods.
013:010 But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him;
        and [we have] priests ministering to Yahweh, the sons of Aaron,
        and the Levites in their work:
013:011 and they burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt
        offerings and sweet incense:  the show bread also [set
        they] in order on the pure table; and the lampstand of gold
        with the lamps of it, to burn every evening:  for we keep
        the charge of Yahweh our God; but you have forsaken him.
013:012 Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with
        the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you.
        Children of Israel, don't you fight against Yahweh, the God
        of your fathers; for you shall not prosper.
013:013 But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them:
        so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
013:014 When Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and
        behind them; and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests sounded
        with the trumpets.
013:015 Then the men of Judah gave a shout:  and as the men of Judah shouted,
        it happened, that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before
        Abijah and Judah.
013:016 The children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered
        them into their hand.
013:017 Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter:
        so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
013:018 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time,
        and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied
        on Yahweh, the God of their fathers.
013:019 Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
        Bethel with the towns of it, and Jeshanah with the towns of it,
        and Ephron with the towns of it.
013:020 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah:
        and Yahweh struck him, and he died.
013:021 But Abijah grew mighty, and took to himself fourteen wives,
        and became the father of twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters.
013:022 The rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings,
        are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.
014:001 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
        the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his place.
        In his days the land was quiet ten years.
014:002 Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God:
014:003 for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places,
        and broke down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,
014:004 and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers,
        and to do the law and the commandment.
014:005 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places
        and the sun images:  and the kingdom was quiet before him.
014:006 He built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet,
        and he had no war in those years, because Yahweh had
        given him rest.
014:007 For he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make
        about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land
        is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God;
        we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side.
        So they built and prospered.
014:008 Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah
        three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore
        shields and drew bows, two hundred eighty thousand:
        all these were mighty men of valor.
014:009 There came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an
        army of a million troops, and three hundred chariots;
        and he came to Mareshah.
014:010 Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array
        in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
014:011 Asa cried to Yahweh his God, and said, Yahweh, there is none besides
        you to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength:
        help us, Yahweh our God; for we rely on you, and in your name
        are we come against this multitude.  Yahweh, you are our God;
        don't let man prevail against you.
014:012 So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
        and the Ethiopians fled.
014:013 Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar:
        and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not
        recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Yahweh,
        and before his army; and they carried away very much booty.
014:014 They struck all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear
        of Yahweh came on them:  and they despoiled all the cities;
        for there was much spoil in them.
014:015 They struck also the tents of livestock, and carried away
        sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.
015:001 The Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded:
015:002 and he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear you me, Asa,
        and all Judah and Benjamin:  Yahweh is with you, while you
        are with him; and if you seek him, he will be found of you;
        but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.
015:003 Now for a long season Israel was without the true God,
        and without a teaching priest, and without law:
015:004 But when in their distress they turned to Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
015:005 In those times there was no peace to him who went out,
        nor to him who came in; but great vexations were on all
        the inhabitants of the lands.
015:006 They were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city
        against city; for God did vex them with all adversity.
015:007 But be you strong, and don't let your hands be slack;
        for your work shall be rewarded.
015:008 When Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet,
        he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all
        the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which
        he had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and he renewed
        the altar of Yahweh, that was before the porch of Yahweh.
015:009 He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who sojourned
        with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon:
        for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they
        saw that Yahweh his God was with him.
015:010 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month,
        in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
015:011 They sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the spoil which they
        had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
015:012 They entered into the covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of
        their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;
015:013 and that whoever would not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        should be put to death, whether small or great,
        whether man or woman.
015:014 They swore to Yahweh with a loud voice, and with shouting,
        and with trumpets, and with cornets.
015:015 All Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with
        all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire;
        and he was found of them:  and Yahweh gave them rest round about.
015:016 Also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen,
        because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah;
        and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt
        it at the brook Kidron.
015:017 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:
        nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
015:018 He brought into the house of God the things that his father
        had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver,
        and gold, and vessels.
015:019 There was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of
        the reign of Asa.
016:001 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king
        of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might
        not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
016:002 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures
        of the house of Yahweh and of the king's house, and sent
        to Ben Hadad king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,
016:003 [There is] a league between me and you, as [there was] between
        my father and your father:  behold, I have sent you silver
        and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel,
        that he may depart from me.
016:004 Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his
        armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon,
        and Dan, and Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.
016:005 It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off
        building Ramah, and let his work cease.
016:006 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones
        of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha had built;
        and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
016:007 At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah,
        and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria,
        and have not relied on Yahweh your God, therefore is the army
        of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.
016:008 Weren't the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots
        and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because you did rely on Yahweh,
        he delivered them into your hand.
016:009 For the eyes of Yahweh run back and forth throughout the whole earth,
        to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart
        is perfect toward him.  Herein you have done foolishly;
        for from henceforth you shall have wars.
016:010 Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison;
        for he was in a rage with him because of this thing.
        Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.
016:011 Behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are
        written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
016:012 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet;
        his disease was exceeding great:  yet in his disease he didn't
        seek Yahweh, but to the physicians.
016:013 Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth
        year of his reign.
016:014 They buried him in his own tombs, which he had hewn out
        for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed
        which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds [of spices]
        prepared by the perfumers' art:  and they made a very great
        burning for him.
017:001 Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened
        himself against Israel.
017:002 He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set
        garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim,
        which Asa his father had taken.
017:003 Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first
        ways of his father David, and didn't seek the Baals,
017:004 but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments,
        and not after the doings of Israel.
017:005 Therefore Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand;
        and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches
        and honor in abundance.
017:006 His heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh:  and furthermore
        he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.
017:007 Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes,
        even Ben Hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel,
        and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;
017:008 and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah,
        and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan,
        and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites;
        and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.
017:009 They taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Yahweh with them;
        and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah,
        and taught among the people.
017:010 The fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were
        round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
017:011 Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents,
        and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks,
        seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand
        and seven hundred male goats.
017:012 Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built in Judah
        castles and cities of store.
017:013 He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war,
        mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.
017:014 This was the numbering of them according to their fathers' houses:
        Of Judah, the captains of thousands:  Adnah the captain,
        and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand;
017:015 and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two
        hundred eighty thousand;
017:016 and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered
        himself to Yahweh; and with him two hundred thousand mighty
        men of valor.
017:017 Of Benjamin:  Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two
        hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;
017:018 and next to him Jehozabad and with him one hundred eighty
        thousand ready prepared for war.
017:019 These were those who waited on the king, besides those whom
        the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
018:001 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he joined
        affinity with Ahab.
018:002 After certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria.
        Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for
        the people who were with him, and moved him to go up [with
        him] to Ramoth Gilead.
018:003 Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will you
        go with me to Ramoth Gilead?  He answered him, I am as you are,
        and my people as your people; and [we will be] with you
        in the war.
018:004 Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire first
        for the word of Yahweh.
018:005 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together,
        four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead
        to battle, or shall I forbear?  They said, Go up; for God
        will deliver it into the hand of the king.
018:006 But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophet of Yahweh besides,
        that we may inquire of him?
018:007 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one
        man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh:  but I hate him;
        for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil:
        the same is Micaiah the son of Imla.  Jehoshaphat said,
        Don't let the king say so.
018:008 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Get quickly
        Micaiah the son of Imla.
018:009 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
        each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were
        sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria;
        and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
018:010 Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said,
        Thus says Yahweh, With these shall you push the Syrians,
        until they be consumed.
018:011 All the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead,
        and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand
        of the king.
018:012 The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold,
        the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one mouth:
        let your word therefore, Please be like one of theirs,
        and speak you good.
018:013 Micaiah said, As Yahweh lives, what my God says, that will I speak.
018:014 When he was come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah,
        shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?
        He said, Go up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered
        into your hand.
018:015 The king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you
        speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh?
018:016 He said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep
        that have no shepherd:  and Yahweh said, These have no master;
        let them return every man to his house in peace.
018:017 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Didn't I tell you
        that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
018:018 [Micaiah] said, "Therefore hear you the word of Yahweh:  I saw
        Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven
        standing on his right hand and on his left.
018:019 Yahweh said, 'Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may
        go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?'  One spoke saying after
        this manner, and another saying after that manner.
018:020 There came forth a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and said,
        'I will entice him.'  Yahweh said to him, 'How?'
018:021 He said, 'I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth
        of all his prophets.'  He said, 'You shall entice him,
        and shall prevail also:  go forth, and do so.'
018:022 Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit
        in the mouth of these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken
        evil concerning you."
018:023 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah
        on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Yahweh
        from me to speak to you?
018:024 Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day, when you
        shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.
018:025 The king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
        to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
018:026 and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
        and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction,
        until I return in peace.
018:027 Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not
        spoken by me.  He said, Hear, you peoples, all of you.
018:028 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
        up to Ramoth Gilead.
018:029 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself,
        and go into the battle; but put you on your robes.
        So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went
        into the battle.
018:030 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of
        his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great,
        save only with the king of Israel.
018:031 It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat,
        that they said, It is the king of Israel.  Therefore they
        turned about to fight against him:  but Jehoshaphat cried out,
        and Yahweh helped him; and God moved them [to depart] from him.
018:032 It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was
        not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
018:033 A certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck
        the king of Israel between the joints of the armor.
        Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn your hand,
        and carry me out of the army; for I am sore wounded.
018:034 The battle increased that day:  however the king of Israel stayed
        himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even;
        and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.
019:001 Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in
        peace to Jerusalem.
019:002 Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him,
        and said to king Jehoshaphat, Should you help the wicked,
        and love those who hate Yahweh? for this thing wrath is on you
        from before Yahweh.
019:003 Nevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you
        have put away the Asheroth out of the land, and have set
        your heart to seek God.
019:004 Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem:  and he went out again among
        the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim,
        and brought them back to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.
019:005 He set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities
        of Judah, city by city,
019:006 and said to the judges, Consider what you do:  for you
        don't judge for man, but for Yahweh; and [he is] with you
        in the judgment.
019:007 Now therefore let the fear of Yahweh be on you; take heed and do it:
        for there is no iniquity with Yahweh our God, nor respect
        of persons, nor taking of bribes.
019:008 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and
        the priests, and of the heads of the fathers' [houses] of Israel,
        for the judgment of Yahweh, and for controversies.
        They returned to Jerusalem.
019:009 He charged them, saying, Thus shall you do in the fear
        of Yahweh, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
019:010 Whenever any controversy shall come to you from your brothers
        who dwell in their cities, between blood and blood,
        between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances,
        you shall warn them, that they not be guilty towards Yahweh,
        and so wrath come on you and on your brothers:  this do,
        and you shall not be guilty.
019:011 Behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all
        matters of Yahweh; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael,
        the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king's matters:
        also the Levites shall be officers before you.
        Deal courageously, and Yahweh be with the good.
020:001 It happened after this, that the children of Moab,
        and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites,
        came against Jehoshaphat to battle.
020:002 Then there came some who told Jehoshaphat, saying, There comes
        a great multitude against you from beyond the sea from Syria;
        and behold, they are in Hazazon Tamar (the same is En Gedi).
020:003 Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek to Yahweh;
        and he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
020:004 Judah gathered themselves together, to seek [help] of Yahweh:
        even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek Yahweh.
020:005 Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem,
        in the house of Yahweh, before the new court;
020:006 and he said, Yahweh, the God of our fathers, aren't you
        God in heaven? and aren't you ruler over all the kingdoms
        of the nations? and in your hand is power and might,
        so that none is able to withstand you.
020:007 Did not you, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land
        before your people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham
        your friend forever?
020:008 They lived therein, and have built you a sanctuary therein
        for your name, saying,
020:009 If evil come on us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence,
        or famine, we will stand before this house, and before you,
        (for your name is in this house), and cry to you in our affliction,
        and you will hear and save.
020:010 Now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir,
        whom you would not let Israel invade, when they came out
        of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them,
        and didn't destroy them;
020:011 behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession,
        which you have given us to inherit.
020:012 Our God, will you not judge them? for we have no might against this
        great company that comes against us; neither know we what to do:
        but our eyes are on you.
020:013 All Judah stood before Yahweh, with their little ones,
        their wives, and their children.
020:014 Then on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah,
        the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite,
        of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of Yahweh in the midst
        of the assembly;
020:015 and he said, Listen you, all Judah, and you inhabitants
        of Jerusalem, and you king Jehoshaphat:  Thus says Yahweh to you,
        Don't be afraid you, neither be dismayed by reason of this
        great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.
020:016 Tomorrow go you down against them:  behold, they come up
        by the ascent of Ziz; and you shall find them at the end
        of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
020:017 You shall not need to fight in this [battle]: set yourselves,
        stand you still, and see the salvation of Yahweh with you,
        O Judah and Jerusalem; don't be afraid, nor be dismayed:
        tomorrow go out against them:  for Yahweh is with you.
020:018 Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground;
        and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down
        before Yahweh, worshipping Yahweh.
020:019 The Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children
        of the Korahites, stood up to praise Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        with an exceeding loud voice.
020:020 They rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness
        of Tekoa:  and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said,
        Hear me, Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem:
        believe in Yahweh your God, so shall you be established;
        believe his prophets, so shall you prosper.
020:021 When he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those
        who should sing to Yahweh, and give praise in holy array,
        as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks to Yahweh;
        for his loving kindness endures forever.
020:022 When they began to sing and to praise, Yahweh set ambushers
        against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir,
        who had come against Judah; and they were struck.
020:023 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
        inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to kill and destroy them:
        and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir,
        everyone helped to destroy another.
020:024 When Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness,
        they looked at the multitude; and behold, they were dead
        bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none who escaped.
020:025 When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them,
        they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies,
        and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves,
        more than they could carry away:  and they were three days
        in taking the spoil, it was so much.
020:026 On the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley
        of Beracah; for there they blessed Yahweh:  therefore the name
        of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this day.
020:027 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat
        in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy;
        for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
020:028 They came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments and harps
        and trumpets to the house of Yahweh.
020:029 The fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries,
        when they heard that Yahweh fought against the enemies of Israel.
020:030 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gave him
        rest round about.
020:031 Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah:  he was thirty-five years old when
        he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem:
        and his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
020:032 He walked in the way of Asa his father, and didn't turn aside
        from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh.
020:033 However the high places were not taken away; neither as yet
        had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers.
020:034 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold,
        they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani,
        which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel.
020:035 After this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
        Ahaziah king of Israel; the same did very wickedly:
020:036 and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish;
        and they made the ships in Ezion Geber.
020:037 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied
        against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have joined
        yourself with Ahaziah, Yahweh has destroyed your works.
        The ships were broken, so that they were not able to
        go to Tarshish.
021:001 Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David:  and Jehoram his son reigned
        in his place.
021:002 He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat:  Azariah, and Jehiel,
        and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah;
        all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
021:003 Their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold,
        and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah:
        but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.
021:004 Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father,
        and had strengthened himself, he killed all his brothers
        with the sword, and various also of the princes of Israel.
021:005 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
021:006 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house
        of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife:
        and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.
021:007 However Yahweh would not destroy the house of David, because of
        the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised
        to give a lamp to him and to his children always.
021:008 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah,
        and made a king over themselves.
021:009 Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots
        with him:  and he rose up by night, and struck the Edomites
        who surrounded him, along with the captains of the chariots.
021:010 So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day:
        then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under his hand,
        because he had forsaken Yahweh, the God of his fathers.
021:011 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah,
        and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute,
        and led Judah astray.
021:012 There came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,
        Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father, Because you
        have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father,
        nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
021:013 but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made
        Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute,
        like as the house of Ahab did, and also have slain your brothers
        of your father's house, who were better than yourself:
021:014 behold, Yahweh will strike with a great plague your people,
        and your children, and your wives, and all your substance;
021:015 and you shall have great sickness by disease of your bowels,
        until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness,
        day by day.
021:016 Yahweh stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines,
        and of the Arabians who are beside the Ethiopians:
021:017 and they came up against Judah, and broke into it, and carried
        away all the substance that was found in the king's house,
        and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son
        left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
021:018 After all this Yahweh struck him in his bowels with
        an incurable disease.
021:019 It happened, in process of time, at the end of two years,
        that his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died
        of sore diseases.  His people made no burning for him,
        like the burning of his fathers.
021:020 Thirty-two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned
        in Jerusalem eight years:  and he departed without being desired;
        and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs
        of the kings.
022:001 The inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest
        son king in his place; for the band of men who came
        with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest.
        So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
022:002 Forty-two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign;
        and he reigned one year in Jerusalem:  and his mother's name
        was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
022:003 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his mother
        was his counselor to do wickedly.
022:004 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did
        the house of Ahab; for they were his counselors after the death
        of his father, to his destruction.
022:005 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram
        the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king
        of Syria at Ramoth Gilead:  and the Syrians wounded Joram.
022:006 He returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had
        given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria.
        Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see
        Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
022:007 Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram:
        for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu
        the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had anointed to cut off
        the house of Ahab.
022:008 It happened, when Jehu was executing judgment on the house
        of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons
        of the brothers of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah,
        and killed them.
022:009 He sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding
        in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and killed him;
        and they buried him, for they said, He is the son
        of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with all his heart.
        The house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.
022:010 Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead,
        she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah.
022:011 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son
        of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons
        who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber.
        So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife
        of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah),
        hid him from Athaliah, so that she didn't kill him.
022:012 He was with them hid in the house of God six years:
        and Athaliah reigned over the land.
023:001 In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took
        the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham,
        and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed,
        and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri,
        into covenant with him.
023:002 They went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out
        of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers'
        [houses] of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
023:003 All the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God.
        He said to them, Behold, the king's son shall reign,
        as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David.
023:004 This is the thing that you shall do:  a third part of you,
        who come in on the Sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites,
        shall be porters of the thresholds;
023:005 and a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third
        part at the gate of the foundation:  and all the people shall
        be in the courts of the house of Yahweh.
023:006 But let none come into the house of Yahweh, save the priests,
        and those who minister of the Levites; they shall come in,
        for they are holy:  but all the people shall keep the
        charge of Yahweh.
023:007 The Levites shall compass the king round about, every man
        with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes into the house,
        let him be slain:  and be you with the king when he comes in,
        and when he goes out.
023:008 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada
        the priest commanded:  and they took every man his men,
        those who were to come in on the Sabbath; with those who were
        to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest didn't
        dismiss the shift.
023:009 Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds
        the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's,
        which were in the house of God.
023:010 He set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand,
        from the right side of the house to the left side of the house,
        along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.
023:011 Then they brought out the king's son, and put the crown
        on him, and [gave him] the testimony, and made him king:
        and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and they said,
        [Long] live the king.
023:012 When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising
        the king, she came to the people into the house of Yahweh:
023:013 and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at
        the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king;
        and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets;
        the singers also [played] on instruments of music, and led
        the singing of praise.  Then Athaliah tore her clothes,
        and said, Treason! treason!
023:014 Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set
        over the army, and said to them, Have her forth between the ranks;
        and whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword:
        for the priest said, Don't kill her in the house of Yahweh.
023:015 So they made way for her; and she went to the entrance of the horse
        gate to the king's house:  and they killed her there.
023:016 Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people,
        and the king, that they should be Yahweh's people.
023:017 All the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down,
        and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and killed
        Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
023:018 Jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of Yahweh under
        the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed
        in the house of Yahweh, to offer the burnt offerings of Yahweh,
        as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and
        with singing, according to the order of David.
023:019 He set the porters at the gates of the house of Yahweh,
        that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in.
023:020 He took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
        governors of the people, and all the people of the land,
        and brought down the king from the house of Yahweh:
        and they came through the upper gate to the king's house,
        and set the king on the throne of the kingdom.
023:021 So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet.
        Athaliah they had slain with the sword.
024:001 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem:  and his mother's
        name was Zibiah, of Beersheba.
024:002 Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days
        of Jehoiada the priest.
024:003 Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he became the father
        of sons and daughters.
024:004 It happened after this, that Joash was minded to restore
        the house of Yahweh.
024:005 He gathered together the priests and the Levites,
        and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather
        of all Israel money to repair the house of your God
        from year to year; and see that you hasten the matter.
        However the Levites didn't hurry.
024:006 The king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him,
        Why haven't you required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah
        and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of Yahweh,
        and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?
024:007 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up
        the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house
        of Yahweh did they bestow on the Baals.
024:008 So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it
        outside at the gate of the house of Yahweh.
024:009 They made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem,
        to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the servant of God
        laid on Israel in the wilderness.
024:010 All the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in,
        and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
024:011 It was so, that whenever the chest was brought to the king's
        officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw
        that there was much money, the king's scribe and the chief
        priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it,
        and carried it to its place again.  Thus they did day by day,
        and gathered money in abundance.
024:012 The king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of
        the service of the house of Yahweh; and they hired masons
        and carpenters to restore the house of Yahweh, and also such
        as worked iron and brass to repair the house of Yahweh.
024:013 So the workmen worked, and the work of repairing went forward
        in their hands, and they set up the house of God in its state,
        and strengthened it.
024:014 When they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money
        before the king and Jehoiada, of which were made vessels
        for the house of Yahweh, even vessels with which to minister
        and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver.
        They offered burnt offerings in the house of Yahweh continually
        all the days of Jehoiada.
024:015 But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died;
        one hundred thirty years old was he when he died.
024:016 They buried him in the city of David among the kings,
        because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.
024:017 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah,
        and made obeisance to the king.  Then the king listened to them.
024:018 They forsook the house of Yahweh, the God of their fathers,
        and served the Asherim and the idols:  and wrath came on Judah
        and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.
024:019 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to Yahweh;
        and they testified against them:  but they would not give ear.
024:020 The Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
        the priest; and he stood above the people, and said to them,
        Thus says God, Why disobey you the commandments of Yahweh,
        so that you can't prosper? because you have forsaken Yahweh,
        he has also forsaken you.
024:021 They conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at
        the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Yahweh.
024:022 Thus Joash the king didn't remember the kindness which
        Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son.
        When he died, he said, Yahweh look on it, and require it.
024:023 It happened at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians
        came up against him:  and they came to Judah and Jerusalem,
        and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people,
        and sent all the spoil of them to the king of Damascus.
024:024 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men;
        and Yahweh delivered a very great army into their hand,
        because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers.
        So they executed judgment on Joash.
024:025 When they were departed for him (for they left him very sick),
        his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons
        of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died;
        and they buried him in the city of David, but they didn't
        bury him in the tombs of the kings.
024:026 These are those who conspired against him:  Zabad the son
        of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of
        Shimrith the Moabitess.
024:027 Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens
        [laid] on him, and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold,
        they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings.
        Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
025:001 Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem:
        and his mother's name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.
025:002 He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, but not
        with a perfect heart.
025:003 Now it happened, when the kingdom was established to him,
        that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father.
025:004 But he didn't put their children to death, but did according
        to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses,
        as Yahweh commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for
        the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers;
        but every man shall die for his own sin.
025:005 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them
        according to their fathers' houses, under captains of thousands
        and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin:
        and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward,
        and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go
        forth to war, who could handle spear and shield.
025:006 He hired also one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out
        of Israel for one hundred talents of silver.
025:007 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, don't let
        the army of Israel go with you; for Yahweh is not with Israel,
        [to wit], with all the children of Ephraim.
025:008 But if you will go, do [valiantly], be strong for the battle:
        God will cast you down before the enemy; for God has power
        to help, and to cast down.
025:009 Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred
        talents which I have given to the army of Israel?  The man
        of God answered, Yahweh is able to give you much more than this.
025:010 Then Amaziah separated them, [to wit], the army that
        had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again:
        therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah,
        and they returned home in fierce anger.
025:011 Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went
        to the Valley of Salt, and struck of the children of
        Seir ten thousand.
025:012 [other] ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive,
        and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from
        the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.
025:013 But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they
        should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah,
        from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and struck of them three thousand,
        and took much spoil.
025:014 Now it happened, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter
        of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children
        of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself
        before them, and burned incense to them.
025:015 Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Amaziah,
        and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, Why have you
        sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered
        their own people out of your hand?
025:016 It happened, as he talked with him, that [the king] said to him,
        Have we made you of the king's counsel?  Stop!  Why should
        you be struck down?  Then the prophet stopped, and said,
        I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you
        have done this, and have not listened to my counsel.
025:017 Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash,
        the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel,
        saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
025:018 Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,
        The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was
        in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife:
        and there passed by a wild animal that was in Lebanon,
        and trod down the thistle.
025:019 You say, Behold, you have struck Edom; and your heart
        lifts you up to boast:  abide now at home; why should you
        meddle to [your] hurt, that you should fall, even you,
        and Judah with you?
025:020 But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might
        deliver them into the hand [of their enemies], because they
        had sought after the gods of Edom.
025:021 So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king
        of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh,
        which belongs to Judah.
025:022 Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every
        man to his tent.
025:023 Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
        of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh, and brought
        him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from
        the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
025:024 [He took] all the gold and silver, and all the vessels
        that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom,
        and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also,
        and returned to Samaria.
025:025 Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death
        of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
025:026 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,
        aren't they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
025:027 Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following
        Yahweh they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem;
        and he fled to Lachish:  but they sent after him to Lachish,
        and killed him there.
025:028 They brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers
        in the city of Judah.
026:001 All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old,
        and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.
026:002 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
        slept with his fathers.
026:003 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign;
        and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem:  and his mother's
        name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.
026:004 He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to
        all that his father Amaziah had done.
026:005 He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah,
        who had understanding in the vision of God:  and as long
        as he sought Yahweh, God made him to prosper.
026:006 He went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke
        down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall
        of Ashdod; and he built cities in [the country of] Ashdod,
        and among the Philistines.
026:007 God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians
        who lived in Gur Baal, and the Meunim.
026:008 The Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah:  and his name spread abroad
        even to the entrance of Egypt; for he grew exceeding strong.
026:009 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate,
        and at the valley gate, and at the turning [of the wall],
        and fortified them.
026:010 He built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns,
        for he had much livestock; in the lowland also, and in the plain:
        [and he had] farmers and vineyard keepers in the mountains
        and in the fruitful fields; for he loved farming.
026:011 Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, who went out to war
        by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made
        by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand
        of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.
026:012 The whole number of the heads of fathers' [houses], even the mighty
        men of valor, was two thousand and six hundred.
026:013 Under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven
        thousand and five hundred, who made war with mighty power,
        to help the king against the enemy.
026:014 Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the army, shields,
        and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows,
        and stones for slinging.
026:015 He made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skillful men,
        to be on the towers and on the battlements, with which to
        shoot arrows and great stones.  His name spread far abroad;
        for he was marvelously helped, until he was strong.
026:016 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that
        he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Yahweh his God;
        for he went into the temple of Yahweh to burn incense on
        the altar of incense.
026:017 Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty
        priests of Yahweh, who were valiant men:
026:018 and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, It pertains
        not to you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but to the priests
        the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense:
        go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed; neither shall
        it be for your honor from Yahweh God.
026:019 Then Uzziah was angry; and he had a censer in his hand
        to burn incense; and while he was angry with the priests,
        the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the priests
        in the house of Yahweh, beside the altar of incense.
026:020 Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked on him,
        and behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him
        out quickly from there; yes, himself hurried also to go out,
        because Yahweh had struck him.
026:021 Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death,
        and lived in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut
        off from the house of Yahweh:  and Jotham his son was over
        the king's house, judging the people of the land.
026:022 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah
        the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.
026:023 So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his
        fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings;
        for they said, He is a leper:  and Jotham his son reigned
        in his place.
027:001 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem:  and his mother's
        name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.
027:002 He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh,
        according to all that his father Uzziah had done:
        however he didn't enter into the temple of Yahweh.
        The people did yet corruptly.
027:003 He built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and on the wall
        of Ophel he built much.
027:004 Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah,
        and in the forests he built castles and towers.
027:005 He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon,
        and prevailed against them.  The children of Ammon gave
        him the same year one hundred talents of silver, and ten
        thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley.
        So much did the children of Ammon render to him, in the second
        year also, and in the third.
027:006 So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before
        Yahweh his God.
027:007 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars,
        and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings
        of Israel and Judah.
027:008 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign,
        and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
027:009 Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city
        of David:  and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
028:001 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned
        sixteen years in Jerusalem:  and he didn't do that which was
        right in the eyes of Yahweh, like David his father;
028:002 but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made
        also molten images for the Baals.
028:003 Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
        and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations
        of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.
028:004 He sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on
        the hills, and under every green tree.
028:005 Therefore Yahweh his God delivered him into the hand of the king
        of Syria; and they struck him, and carried away of his a
        great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus.
        He was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel,
        who struck him with a great slaughter.
028:006 For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred
        twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men;
        because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers.
028:007 Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son,
        and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah who was
        next to the king.
028:008 The children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers
        two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took
        also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
028:009 But a prophet of Yahweh was there, whose name was Oded:
        and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria, and said
        to them, Behold, because Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
        was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand,
        and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.
028:010 Now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah
        and Jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids to you:
        [but] aren't there even with you trespasses of your own
        against Yahweh your God?
028:011 Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that you
        have taken captive of your brothers; for the fierce wrath
        of Yahweh is on you.
028:012 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah
        the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth,
        and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai,
        stood up against those who came from the war,
028:013 and said to them, You shall not bring in the captives here:
        for you purpose that which will bring on us a trespass
        against Yahweh, to add to our sins and to our trespass; for our
        trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.
028:014 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before
        the princes and all the assembly.
028:015 The men who have been mentioned by name rose up, and took
        the captives, and with the spoil clothed all who were
        naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them,
        and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them,
        and carried all the feeble of them on donkeys, and brought
        them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers:
        then they returned to Samaria.
028:016 At that time did king Ahaz send to the kings of Assyria
        to help him.
028:017 For again the Edomites had come and struck Judah,
        and carried away captives.
028:018 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland,
        and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh,
        and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns of it,
        and Timnah with the towns of it, Gimzo also and the towns of it:
        and they lived there.
028:019 For Yahweh brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;
        for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed
        severely against Yahweh.
028:020 Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him,
        but didn't strengthen him.
028:021 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Yahweh,
        and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave
        it to the king of Assyria:  but it didn't help him.
028:022 In the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Yahweh,
        this same king Ahaz.
028:023 For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which struck him;
        and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them,
        [therefore] will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me.
        But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
028:024 Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God,
        and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut
        up the doors of the house of Yahweh; and he made him altars
        in every corner of Jerusalem.
028:025 In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense
        to other gods, and provoked to anger Yahweh, the God
        of his fathers.
028:026 Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold,
        they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
028:027 Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city,
        even in Jerusalem; for they didn't bring him into the tombs
        of the kings of Israel:  and Hezekiah his son reigned
        in his place.
029:001 Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old;
        and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem:
        and his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
029:002 He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to
        all that David his father had done.
029:003 He in the first year of his reign, in the first month,
        opened the doors of the house of Yahweh, and repaired them.
029:004 He brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them
        together into the broad place on the east,
029:005 and said to them, Hear me, you Levites; now sanctify yourselves,
        and sanctify the house of Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
        and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.
029:006 For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil
        in the sight of Yahweh our God, and have forsaken him,
        and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh,
        and turned their backs.
029:007 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out
        the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt
        offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.
029:008 Therefore the wrath of Yahweh was on Judah and Jerusalem,
        and he has delivered them to be tossed back and forth,
        to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as you see with your eyes.
029:009 For, behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons
        and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
029:010 Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.
029:011 My sons, don't be negligent now; for Yahweh has chosen you
        to stand before him, to minister to him, and that you should
        be his ministers, and burn incense.
029:012 Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai,
        and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites;
        and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah
        the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son
        of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;
029:013 and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons
        of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
029:014 and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons
        of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
029:015 They gathered their brothers, and sanctified themselves,
        and went in, according to the commandment of the king
        by the words of Yahweh, to cleanse the house of Yahweh.
029:016 The priests went in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh,
        to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found
        in the temple of Yahweh into the court of the house of Yahweh.
        The Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.
029:017 Now they began on the first [day] of the first month to sanctify,
        and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Yahweh;
        and they sanctified the house of Yahweh in eight days:
        and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
029:018 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within [the palace],
        and said, We have cleansed all the house of Yahweh,
        and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels of it,
        and the table of show bread, with all the vessels of it.
029:019 Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast
        away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified;
        and behold, they are before the altar of Yahweh.
029:020 Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes
        of the city, and went up to the house of Yahweh.
029:021 They brought seven bulls, and seven rams, and seven lambs,
        and seven male goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom
        and for the sanctuary and for Judah.  He commanded the priests
        the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Yahweh.
029:022 So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood,
        and sprinkled it on the altar:  and they killed the rams,
        and sprinkled the blood on the altar:  they killed also the lambs,
        and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
029:023 They brought near the male goats for the sin offering before
        the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands on them:
029:024 and the priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with
        their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel;
        for the king commanded [that] the burnt offering and the sin
        offering [should be made] for all Israel.
029:025 He set the Levites in the house of Yahweh with cymbals,
        with stringed instruments, and with harps, according to
        the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer,
        and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Yahweh
        by his prophets.
029:026 The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests
        with the trumpets.
029:027 Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar.
        When the burnt offering began, the song of Yahweh began also,
        and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David
        king of Israel.
029:028 All the assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the
        trumpeters sounded; all this [continued] until the burnt
        offering was finished.
029:029 When they had made an end of offering, the king and all who
        were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped.
029:030 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded
        the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David,
        and of Asaph the seer.  They sang praises with gladness,
        and they bowed their heads and worshiped.
029:031 Then Hezekiah answered, Now you have consecrated yourselves
        to Yahweh; come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings
        into the house of Yahweh.  The assembly brought in sacrifices
        and thank offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart
        [brought] burnt offerings.
029:032 The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought
        was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs:
        all these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh.
029:033 The consecrated things were six hundred oxen and
        three thousand sheep.
029:034 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all
        the burnt offerings:  therefore their brothers the Levites
        helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests
        had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright
        in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
029:035 Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat
        of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every
        burnt offering.  So the service of the house of Yahweh was
        set in order.
029:036 Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God
        had prepared for the people:  for the thing was done suddenly.
030:001 Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also
        to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house
        of Yahweh at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to Yahweh,
        the God of Israel.
030:002 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly
        in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover in the second month.
030:003 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests
        had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had
        the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
030:004 The thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.
030:005 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout
        all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come
        to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem:
        for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort
        as it is written.
030:006 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his
        princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to
        the commandment of the king, saying, You children of Israel,
        turn again to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
        that he may return to the remnant that have escaped of you
        out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
030:007 Don't be you like your fathers, and like your brothers,
        who trespassed against Yahweh, the God of their fathers,
        so that he gave them up to desolation, as you see.
030:008 Now don't you be stiff-necked, as your fathers were;
        but yield yourselves to Yahweh, and enter into his sanctuary,
        which he has sanctified forever, and serve Yahweh your God,
        that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
030:009 For if you turn again to Yahweh, your brothers and your children
        shall find compassion before those who led them captive,
        and shall come again into this land:  for Yahweh your God is
        gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you,
        if you return to him.
030:010 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
        Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun:  but they ridiculed them,
        and mocked them.
030:011 Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun
        humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
030:012 Also on Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart,
        to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by
        the word of Yahweh.
030:013 There assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
        of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.
030:014 They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem,
        and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them
        into the brook Kidron.
030:015 Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth [day] of the
        second month:  and the priests and the Levites were ashamed,
        and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into
        the house of Yahweh.
030:016 They stood in their place after their order, according to the law
        of Moses the man of God:  the priests sprinkled the blood
        [which they received] of the hand of the Levites.
030:017 For there were many in the assembly who had not
        sanctified themselves:  therefore the Levites had the charge
        of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean,
        to sanctify them to Yahweh.
030:018 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim
        and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves,
        yet did they eat the Passover otherwise than it is written.
        For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good
        Yahweh pardon everyone
030:019 who sets his heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his fathers,
        though not [cleansed] according to the purification
        of the sanctuary.
030:020 Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
030:021 The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept
        the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness;
        and the Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day,
        [singing] with loud instruments to Yahweh.
030:022 Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who had good
        understanding [in the service] of Yahweh.  So they ate
        throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices
        of peace offerings, and making confession to Yahweh, the God
        of their fathers.
030:023 The whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days;
        and they kept [other] seven days with gladness.
030:024 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings
        one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes
        gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep:
        and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
030:025 All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites,
        and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the
        foreigners who came out of the land of Israel, and who lived
        in Judah, rejoiced.
030:026 So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time
        of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not
        the like in Jerusalem.
030:027 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people:
        and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his
        holy habitation, even to heaven.
031:001 Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went
        out to the cities of Judah, and broke in pieces the pillars,
        and hewed down the Asherim, and broke down the high places
        and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim
        also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all.
        Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to
        his possession, into their own cities.
031:002 Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites
        after their divisions, every man according to his service,
        both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings
        and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks,
        and to praise in the gates of the camp of Yahweh.
031:003 [He appointed] also the king's portion of his substance for
        the burnt offerings, [to wit], for the morning and evening
        burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths,
        and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written
        in the law of Yahweh.
031:004 Moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give
        the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might
        give themselves to the law of Yahweh.
031:005 As soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel
        gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine,
        and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field;
        and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.
031:006 The children of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities
        of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep,
        and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated
        to Yahweh their God, and laid them by heaps.
031:007 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps,
        and finished them in the seventh month.
031:008 When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps,
        they blessed Yahweh, and his people Israel.
031:009 Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites
        concerning the heaps.
031:010 Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him
        and said, Since [the people] began to bring the offerings
        into the house of Yahweh, we have eaten and had enough,
        and have left plenty:  for Yahweh has blessed his people;
        and that which is left is this great store.
031:011 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Yahweh;
        and they prepared them.
031:012 They brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated
        things faithfully:  and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler,
        and Shimei his brother was second.
031:013 Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
        and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah,
        were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother,
        by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler
        of the house of God.
031:014 Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east [gate],
        was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute
        the offerings of Yahweh, and the most holy things.
031:015 Under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah,
        and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their
        office of trust, to give to their brothers by divisions,
        as well to the great as to the small:
031:016 besides those who were reckoned by genealogy of males,
        from three years old and upward, even everyone who entered
        into the house of Yahweh, as the duty of every day required,
        for their service in their offices according to their divisions;
031:017 and those who were reckoned by genealogy of the priests
        by their fathers' houses, and the Levites from twenty years
        old and upward, in their offices by their divisions;
031:018 and those who were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones,
        their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all
        the congregation:  for in their office of trust they sanctified
        themselves in holiness.
031:019 Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields
        of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men
        who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males
        among the priests, and to all who were reckoned by genealogy
        among the Levites.
031:020 Thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and he worked that
        which was good and right and faithful before Yahweh his God.
031:021 In every work that he began in the service of the house of God,
        and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God,
        he did it with all his heart, and prospered.
032:001 After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king
        of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against
        the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.
032:002 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was
        purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
032:003 he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop
        the waters of the springs which were outside of the city;
        and they helped him.
032:004 So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped
        all the springs, and the brook that flowed through the midst
        of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come,
        and find much water?
032:005 He took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down,
        and raised [it] up to the towers, and the other wall outside,
        and strengthened Millo [in] the city of David, and made
        weapons and shields in abundance.
032:006 He set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
        together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city,
        and spoke comfortably to them, saying,
032:007 Be strong and of good courage, don't be afraid nor dismayed for
        the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude who is with him;
        for there is a greater with us than with him:
032:008 with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Yahweh our God
        to help us, and to fight our battles.  The people rested
        themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
032:009 After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants
        to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and all his power
        with him), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah
        who were at Jerusalem, saying,
032:010 Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do you trust,
        that you abide the siege in Jerusalem?
032:011 Does not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die
        by famine and by thirst, saying, Yahweh our God will deliver
        us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
032:012 Has not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars,
        and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, You shall worship
        before one altar, and on it shall you burn incense?
032:013 Don't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples
        of the lands?  Were the gods of the nations of the lands
        in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?
032:014 Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers
        utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand,
        that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
032:015 Now therefore don't let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade
        you after this manner, neither believe you him; for no god
        of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people
        out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers:
        how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?
032:016 His servants spoke yet more against Yahweh God, and against
        his servant Hezekiah.
032:017 He wrote also letters, to rail on Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations
        of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of
        my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people
        out of my hand.
032:018 They cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people
        of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them,
        and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
032:019 They spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples
        of the earth, which are the work of men's hands.
032:020 Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz,
        prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.
032:021 Yahweh sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor,
        and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria.
        So he returned with shame of face to his own land.
        When he was come into the house of his god, those who came
        forth from his own bowels killed him there with the sword.
032:022 Thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
        from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from
        the hand of all [others], and guided them on every side.
032:023 Many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem, and precious things
        to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight
        of all nations from thenceforth.
032:024 In those days Hezekiah was sick even to death:  and he prayed
        to Yahweh; and he spoke to him, and gave him a sign.
032:025 But Hezekiah didn't render again according to the benefit done to him;
        for his heart was lifted up:  therefore there was wrath on him,
        and on Judah and Jerusalem.
032:026 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart,
        both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath
        of Yahweh didn't come on them in the days of Hezekiah.
032:027 Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor:
        and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold,
        and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields,
        and for all manner of goodly vessels;
032:028 storehouses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil;
        and stalls for all manner of animals, and flocks in folds.
032:029 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and
        herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance.
032:030 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters
        of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side
        of the city of David.  Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
032:031 However in [the business of] the ambassadors of the princes
        of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was
        done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know
        all that was in his heart.
032:032 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds,
        behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet
        the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
032:033 Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
        the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David:  and all Judah
        and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death.
        Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
033:001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
033:002 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh,
        after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out
        before the children of Israel.
033:003 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father
        had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baals,
        and made Asheroth, and worshiped all the army of the sky,
        and served them.
033:004 He built altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh said,
        In Jerusalem shall my name be forever.
033:005 He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts
        of the house of Yahweh.
033:006 He also made his children to pass through the fire in
        the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practiced sorcery,
        and used enchantments, and practiced sorcery, and dealt
        with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards:
        he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke
        him to anger.
033:007 He set the engraved image of the idol, which he had made,
        in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon
        his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen
        out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever:
033:008 neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off
        the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they
        will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all
        the law and the statutes and the ordinances [given] by Moses.
033:009 Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
        so that they did evil more than did the nations whom Yahweh
        destroyed before the children of Israel.
033:010 Yahweh spoke to Manasseh, and to his people; but they
        gave no heed.
033:011 Therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the army
        of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains,
        and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
033:012 When he was in distress, he begged Yahweh his God, and humbled
        himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
033:013 He prayed to him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his
        supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom.
        Then Manasseh knew that Yahweh he was God.
033:014 Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David,
        on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance
        at the fish gate; and he compassed Ophel about [with it],
        and raised it up to a very great height:  and he put valiant
        captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.
033:015 He took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house
        of Yahweh, and all the altars that he had built in the mountain
        of the house of Yahweh, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out
        of the city.
033:016 He built up the altar of Yahweh, and offered thereon sacrifices
        of peace offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah
        to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel.
033:017 Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places,
        but only to Yahweh their God.
033:018 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God,
        and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts
        of the kings of Israel.
033:019 His prayer also, and how [God] was entreated of him, and all
        his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built
        high places, and set up the Asherim and the engraved images,
        before he humbled himself:  behold, they are written in
        the history of Hozai.
033:020 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his
        own house:  and Amon his son reigned in his place.
033:021 Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
033:022 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did
        Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved
        images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.
033:023 He didn't humble himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his
        father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed
        more and more.
033:024 His servants conspired against him, and put him to death
        in his own house.
033:025 But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired
        against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah
        his son king in his place.
034:001 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
034:002 He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked
        in the ways of David his father, and didn't turn aside
        to the right hand or to the left.
034:003 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young,
        he began to seek after the God of David his father;
        and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem
        from the high places, and the Asherim, and the engraved images,
        and the molten images.
034:004 They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence;
        and the incense altars that were on high above them he hewed down;
        and the Asherim, and the engraved images, and the molten images,
        he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it
        on the graves [of those] who had sacrificed to them.
034:005 He burnt the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged
        Judah and Jerusalem.
034:006 [So did he] in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon,
        even to Naphtali, in their ruins round about.
034:007 He broke down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the engraved
        images into powder, and hewed down all the incense altars
        throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.
034:008 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged
        the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah,
        and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son
        of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Yahweh his God.
034:009 They came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money
        that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites,
        the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand
        of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel,
        and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
034:010 They delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the
        oversight of the house of Yahweh; and the workmen who labored
        in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house;
034:011 even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it,
        to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams
        for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
034:012 The men did the work faithfully:  and the overseers of them
        were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari;
        and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites,
        to set it forward; and [others of] the Levites, all who were
        skillful with instruments of music.
034:013 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set
        forward all who did the work in every manner of service:
        and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
034:014 When they brought out the money that was brought into the house
        of Yahweh, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law
        of Yahweh [given] by Moses.
034:015 Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book
        of the law in the house of Yahweh.  Hilkiah delivered
        the book to Shaphan.
034:016 Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back
        word to the king, saying, All that was committed to your servants,
        they are doing.
034:017 They have emptied out the money that was found in the house
        of Yahweh, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers,
        and into the hand of the workmen.
034:018 Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has
        delivered me a book.  Shaphan read therein before the king.
034:019 It happened, when the king had heard the words of the law,
        that he tore his clothes.
034:020 The king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
        and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah
        the king's servant, saying,
034:021 Go you, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel
        and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found;
        for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is poured out on us,
        because our fathers have not kept the word of Yahweh,
        to do according to all that is written in this book.
034:022 So Hilkiah, and they whom the king [had commanded],
        went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son
        of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe;
        (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter;)
        and they spoke to her to that effect.
034:023 She said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel:  Tell you
        the man who sent you to me,
034:024 Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on this place,
        and on the inhabitants of it, even all the curses that are written
        in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.
034:025 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods,
        that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of
        their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out on this place,
        and it shall not be quenched.
034:026 But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh,
        thus shall you tell him, Thus says Yahweh, the God
        of Israel:  As touching the words which you have heard,
034:027 because your heart was tender, and you did humble yourself
        before God, when you heard his words against this place,
        and against the inhabitants of it, and have humbled yourself
        before me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me;
        I also have heard you, says Yahweh.
034:028 Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered
        to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil
        that I will bring on this place, and on the inhabitants of it.
        They brought back word to the king.
034:029 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders
        of Judah and Jerusalem.
034:030 The king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men
        of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests,
        and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small:
        and he read in their ears all the words of the book of
        the covenant that was found in the house of Yahweh.
034:031 The king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Yahweh,
        to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments,
        and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart,
        and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant
        that were written in this book.
034:032 He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin
        to stand [to it]. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according
        to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
034:033 Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries
        that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all who were
        found in Israel to serve, even to serve Yahweh their God.
        All his days they didn't depart from following Yahweh,
        the God of their fathers.
035:001 Josiah kept a Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem:  and they killed
        the Passover on the fourteenth [day] of the first month.
035:002 He set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them
        to the service of the house of Yahweh.
035:003 He said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy
        to Yahweh, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son
        of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be
        a burden on your shoulders:  now serve Yahweh your God,
        and his people Israel.
035:004 Prepare yourselves after your fathers' houses by your divisions,
        according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according
        to the writing of Solomon his son.
035:005 Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers'
        houses of your brothers the children of the people,
        and [let there be for each] a portion of a fathers'
        house of the Levites.
035:006 Kill the Passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for
        your brothers, to do according to the word of Yahweh by Moses.
035:007 Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock,
        lambs and kids, all of them for the Passover offerings,
        to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand,
        and three thousand bulls:  these were of the king's substance.
035:008 His princes gave for a freewill offering to the people,
        to the priests, and to the Levites.  Hilkiah and Zechariah
        and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests
        for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hundred
        [small livestock], and three hundred oxen.
035:009 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers,
        and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites,
        gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand
        [small livestock], and five hundred oxen.
035:010 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in
        their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to
        the king's commandment.
035:011 They killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled [the blood
        which they received] of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.
035:012 They removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them
        according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the children
        of the people, to offer to Yahweh, as it is written in the book
        of Moses.  So did they with the oxen.
035:013 They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance:
        and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons,
        and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children
        of the people.
035:014 Afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests,
        because the priests the sons of Aaron [were busied]
        in offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night:
        therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests
        the sons of Aaron.
035:015 The singers the sons of Asaph were in their place,
        according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman,
        and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters were at every gate:
        they didn't need to depart from their service; for their
        brothers the Levites prepared for them.
035:016 So all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day,
        to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings on the altar
        of Yahweh, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
035:017 The children of Israel who were present kept the Passover
        at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
035:018 There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days
        of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel
        keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, and the priests,
        and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present,
        and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
035:019 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept.
035:020 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king
        of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates:
        and Josiah went out against him.
035:021 But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you,
        you king of Judah?  [I come] not against you this day,
        but against the house with which I have war; and God has commanded
        me to make haste:  forbear you from [meddling with] God,
        who is with me, that he not destroy you.
035:022 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him,
        but disguised himself, that he might fight with him,
        and didn't listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God,
        and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
035:023 The archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants,
        Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
035:024 So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in
        the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem;
        and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers.
        All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
035:025 Jeremiah lamented for Josiah:  and all the singing men
        and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations
        to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel:
        and behold, they are written in the lamentations.
035:026 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds,
        according to that which is written in the law of Yahweh,
035:027 and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written
        in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
036:001 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,
        and made him king in his father's place in Jerusalem.
036:002 Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
036:003 The king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land
        one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
036:004 The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah
        and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim.
        Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
036:005 Jehoiakim was Twenty-five years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:  and he did that
        which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God.
036:006 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound
        him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
036:007 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Yahweh
        to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
036:008 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations
        which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are
        written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah:
        and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.
036:009 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem:
        and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.
036:010 At the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought
        him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Yahweh,
        and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
036:011 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:
036:012 and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God;
        he didn't humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet [speaking]
        from the mouth of Yahweh.
036:013 He also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made
        him swear by God:  but he stiffened his neck, and hardened
        his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
036:014 Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people,
        trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations;
        and they polluted the house of Yahweh which he had made
        holy in Jerusalem.
036:015 Yahweh, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers,
        rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on
        his people, and on his dwelling place:
036:016 but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words,
        and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Yahweh arose
        against his people, until there was no remedy.
036:017 Therefore he brought on them the king of the Chaldeans,
        who killed their young men with the sword in the house of
        their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin,
        old man or gray-headed: he gave them all into his hand.
036:018 All the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the
        treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king,
        and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.
036:019 They burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem,
        and burnt all the palaces of it with fire, and destroyed
        all the goodly vessels of it.
036:020 He carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon;
        and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign
        of the kingdom of Persia:
036:021 to fulfill the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah,
        until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths:  [for] as long as it
        lay desolate it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.
036:022 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
        of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished,
        Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia,
        so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom,
        and [put it] also in writing, saying,
036:023 Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth
        has Yahweh, the God of heaven, given me; and he has charged
        me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
        Whoever there is among you of all his people, Yahweh his God
        be with him, and let him go up.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the

[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the

          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the

     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
