Book 50 Philippians
001:001 Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ; To all the saints
        in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers{or,
        superintendents, or bishops} and servants{Or, deacons}:
001:002 Grace to you, and peace from God, our Father, and the
        Lord Jesus Christ.
001:003 I thank my God whenever I remember you,
001:004 always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making
        my requests with joy,
001:005 for your partnership{The word translated "partnership"
        (koinonia) also means "fellowship" and "sharing."} in furtherance
        of the Good News from the first day until now;
001:006 being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good
        work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.
001:007 It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you,
        because I have you in my heart, because, both in my bonds
        and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News,
        you all are partakers with me of grace.
001:008 For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender
        mercies of Christ Jesus.
001:009 This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more
        in knowledge and all discernment;
001:010 so that you may approve the things that are excellent;
        that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ;
001:011 being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are
        through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
001:012 Now I desire to have you know, brothers,{The word for "brothers"
        here and where context allows may also be correctly translated
        "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."} that the things
        which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress
        of the Good News;
001:013 so that it became evident to the whole praetorian guard,
        and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;
001:014 and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident
        through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word
        of God without fear.
001:015 Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife,
        and some also out of good will.
001:016 The former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition,
        thinking that they add affliction to my chains;
001:017 but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed
        for the defense of the Good News.
001:018 What does it matter?  Only that in every way,
        whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed.
        I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.
001:019 For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your
        supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
001:020 according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will
        in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always,
        now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life,
        or by death.
001:021 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
001:022 But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work;
        yet I don't make known what I will choose.
001:023 But I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire
        to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.
001:024 Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.
001:025 Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain
        with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,
001:026 that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through
        my presence with you again.
001:027 Only let your manner of life be worthy of the Good News
        of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent,
        I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit,
        with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;
001:028 and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is
        for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation,
        and that from God.
001:029 Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ,
        not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,
001:030 having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear
        is in me.
002:001 If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any
        consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit,
        if any tender mercies and compassion,
002:002 make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love,
        being of one accord, of one mind;
002:003 doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility,
        each counting others better than himself;
002:004 each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you
        also to the things of others.
002:005 Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,
002:006 who, existing in the form of God, didn't consider equality
        with God a thing to be grasped,
002:007 but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made
        in the likeness of men.
002:008 And being found in human form, he humbled himself,
        becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross.
002:009 Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name
        which is above every name;
002:010 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven,
        those on earth, and those under the earth,
002:011 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
        to the glory of God the Father.
002:012 So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed,
        not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence,
        work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
002:013 For it is God who works in you both to will and to work,
        for his good pleasure.
002:014 Do all things without murmurings and disputes,
002:015 that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without
        blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation,
        among whom you are seen as lights in the world,
002:016 holding up the word of life; that I may have something
        to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn't run in vain nor
        labor in vain.
002:017 Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service
        of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.
002:018 In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.
002:019 But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon,
        that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.
002:020 For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.
002:021 For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
002:022 But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father,
        so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.
002:023 Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it
        will go with me.
002:024 But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.
002:025 But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus,
        my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle
        and servant of my need;
002:026 since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you
        had heard that he was sick.
002:027 For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him;
        and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have
        sorrow on sorrow.
002:028 I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see
        him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
002:029 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold
        such in honor,
002:030 because for the work of Christ he came near to death,
        risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your
        service toward me.
003:001 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.  To write the same
        things to you, to me indeed is not tiresome, but for you
        it is safe.
003:002 Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of
        the false circumcision.
003:003 For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit,
        and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh;
003:004 though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh.
        If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh,
        I yet more:
003:005 circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe
        of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;
003:006 concerning zeal, persecuting the assembly; concerning the
        righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.
003:007 However, what things were gain to me, these have I counted
        loss for Christ.
003:008 Yes most certainly, and I count all things to be loss for
        the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord,
        for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and count them
        nothing but refuse, that I may gain Christ
003:009 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own,
        that which is of the law, but that which is through faith
        in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;
003:010 that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection,
        and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed
        to his death;
003:011 if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
003:012 Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect;
        but I press on, if it is so that I may take hold of that for
        which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus.
003:013 Brothers, I don't regard myself as yet having taken hold,
        but one thing I do.  Forgetting the things which are behind,
        and stretching forward to the things which are before,
003:014 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the high calling
        of God in Christ Jesus.
003:015 Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, think this way.
        If in anything you think otherwise, God will also reveal
        that to you.
003:016 Nevertheless, to the extent that we have already attained,
        let us walk by the same rule.  Let us be of the same mind.
003:017 Brothers, be imitators together of me, and note those who walk
        this way, even as you have us for an example.
003:018 For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you
        even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ,
003:019 whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose
        glory is in their shame, who think about earthly things.
003:020 For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait
        for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;
003:021 who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed
        to the body of his glory, according to the working by which
        he is able even to subject all things to himself.
004:001 Therefore, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown,
        so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.
004:002 I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way
        in the Lord.
004:003 Yes, I beg you also, true yokefellow, help these women,
        for they labored with me in the Good News, with Clement also,
        and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the
        book of life.
004:004 Rejoice in the Lord always!  Again I will say, Rejoice!
004:005 Let your gentleness be known to all men.  The Lord is at hand.
004:006 In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition
        with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
004:007 And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,
        will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
004:008 Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things
        are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure,
        whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report;
        if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise,
        think about these things.
004:009 The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me:
        do these things, and the God of peace will be with you.
004:010 But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you
        have revived your thought for me; in which you did indeed
        take thought, but you lacked opportunity.
004:011 Not that I speak in respect to lack, for I have learned
        in whatever state I am, to be content in it.
004:012 I know how to be humbled, and I know also how to abound.
        In everything and in all things I have learned the secret
        both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to
        be in need.
004:013 I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.
004:014 However you did well that you shared in my affliction.
004:015 You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning
        of the Good News, when I departed from Macedonia, no assembly
        shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving
        but you only.
004:016 For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.
004:017 Not that I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that
        increases to your account.
004:018 But I have all things, and abound.  I am filled, having
        received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you,
        a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing
        sacrifice to God.
004:019 My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches
        in glory in Christ Jesus.
004:020 Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever!  Amen.
004:021 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.  The brothers who are
        with me greet you.
004:022 All the saints greet you, especially those who are
        of Caesar's household.
004:023 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.  Amen.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
