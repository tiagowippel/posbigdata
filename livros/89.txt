DESCRIPTION: Cross-Border Services

Title III of the Export Trading
Company Act of 1982 authorizes the
Secretary of Commerce to issue
"certificates of review" with respect
to export conduct.  The Act calls for
the issuance of a certificate of
review if the Secretary determines,
and the Attorney General concurs, that
the export conduct specified in an
application will not have the
anticompetitive effects proscribed by
the Act.  A certificate of review
limits the liability under federal and
state antitrust laws in engaging in
the export conduct certified.

Only a "person" as defined by the Act
can apply for a certificate of review.
The term "person" means "an individual
who is a resident of the United
States; a partnership that is created
under and exists pursuant to the laws
of any State or of the United States;
a State or local government entity; a
corporation, whether organized as a
profit or nonprofit corporation, that
is created under and exists pursuant
to the laws of any State or of the
United States; or any association or
combination, by contract or other
arrangement, between such persons."

A foreign national or enterprise can
receive the protection provided by a
certificate of review by becoming a
"member" of a qualified applicant.
The regulations define "member" to
mean "an entity (U.S. or foreign)
which is seeking protection under the
certificate with the applicant.  A
member may be a partner in a
partnership or a joint venture; a
shareholder of a corporation; or a
participant in an association,
cooperative, or other form of profit
or nonprofit organization or
relationship, by contract or other
arrangement."

Department of Commerce.  A general
license requires no application or
documentation and is generally
available for use by all persons.

An application for a validated license
may be made only by a person subject
to the jurisdiction of the United
States who is in fact the exporter, or
by his duly authorized agent.  An
application may be made on behalf of a
person not subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States by an authorized
agent in the United States, who then
becomes the applicant.

pipelines, or pipelines carrying
products refined from them, across on-
shore federal lands, or acquire leases
or interests in certain minerals, such

federal lands or lease to develop
mineral resources on on-shore federal

home country denies similar or like
privileges for the mineral or access
in question to U.S. citizens or
corporations, as compared with the
privileges it accords to its own
(30 U.S.C. 181, 183(a)).

2.  Nationalization is not considered
to be denial of similar or like
privileges.


3.  See also 10 U.S.C. 7435, which
restricts foreign citizens, or
corporations controlled by them, from
obtaining access to leases on Naval
Petroleum Reserves, should the laws,

LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT: Federal

LEGAL CITATION: Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended;
		14 C.F.R.  For purposes of this entry, the Description
		governs.

DESCRIPTION: Investment

Whether an entity is a U.S. citizen
determines the type of commercial air
services company that it can own or
control.  Under the Federal Aviation
Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. App. Ch. 20),
"citizens" include (1) individuals who
are citizens;  (2) a partnership in
which each member is a citizen of the
U.S.;  or (3) a U.S. corporation of
which the president and at least
two-thirds of the board of directors
and other managing officers are U.S.
citizens, and at least seventy-five
percent of the voting interest in the
corporation is owned or controlled by
U.S. citizens. 49 U.S.C. App.
1301(16).

In addition, this statutory
requirement has historically been
interpreted by the Department of
Transportation (and the Civil
Aeronautics Board before it) to
require that an air carrier in fact be
under the actual control of U.S.
citizens.  The Department of
Transportation makes this
determination on a case-by-case basis.
Nevertheless, the Department has
provided guidance as to some lines of
demarcation.  For example, total
foreign equity investment of up to 49
percent (with a maximum of 25 percent
being voting stock), taken alone, is
not construed as indicative of foreign
control.  (See Department of
Transportation Order 91-1-41, January
23, 1991.)

Only air carriers that are U.S.
citizens are permitted to operate
domestic air services or operate
international air services as a "U.S."
carrier;  non-U.S. citizens may own
and control foreign air carriers that
operate between the U.S. and foreign
points.  See Sections 401, 402,
417(b)(7) and 1108 of the Federal
Aviation Act.  The different rights of
each type of air carrier are usually
spelled out in the applicable aviation
bilateral agreement.

Certain distinctions based on
citizenship also exist with regard to
other types of air services providers,
such as air freight forwarders (14
C.F.R. 297), charter operators (14
C.F.R. 380), and intermodal operators
(14 C.F.R. 222).

Air freight forwarders may be "U.S.
citizens" (defined as indicated above)
which use the services of (inter alia)
direct air carriers (with a Department
of Transportation certificate,
regulation, order or permit) to
transport property. 14 C.F.R. Part
296.  They may also be "foreign air
freight forwarders", which similarly
use direct air carriers to transport
property.  14 C.F.R. Part 296.	There
is no "U.S. citizenship" requirement
for "foreign air freight forwarders."
14 C.F.R. 297.3(d).  Foreign air
freight forwarders may obtain the same
operating exemptions available to U.S.
citizens.  They must, however, apply
for registration with the Department
of Transportation.  Their application
can be rejected "for reasons relating
to the failure of effective
reciprocity, or if the Department
finds that it is in the public
interest to do so."  14 C.F.R.
297.22.

Charter operators may be "public
charter operators", which inter alia
must be "U.S. citizens" (defined as
indicated above) or "foreign charter
operators," for which there is not a
citizenship requirement.  14 C.F.R.
380.2.  Unlike domestic charter
operators, "foreign charter operators"
wishing to operate charters which
originate in the U.S. must register
with the Department of Transportation.
14 C.F.R. 380.61.  The Department of
Transportation may reject a
registration application "for reasons
relating to the failure of effective
reciprocity or if the Department finds
it would be in the public interest to
do so."  14 C.F.R.  380.64.

A direct foreign air carrier may
engage in the surface transport of
property (which it has carried by air)
in a zone extending 35 miles from the
boundary of the airport or city it is
authorized to serve.  There is no such
geographic limitation on a direct U.S.
air carrier, or on a U.S. or foreign
indirect air carrier.

DESCRIPTION: Cross-Border Services

Operating authority from the
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)
is required to provide interstate or
cross border bus or truck services in
the territory of the United States.  A
moratorium has been imposed on new
grants of operating authority for
persons of Mexico, except for
provision of cross-border charter or
tour bus services.

Under the moratorium, persons of
Mexico without operating authority may
operate only within ICC Border
Commercial Zones, for which ICC
operating authority is not required.
Persons of Mexico providing truck
services (including for hire, private,
and exempt services) without operating
authority are required to obtain a
certificate of registration from the
ICC to enter the United States and
operate in the ICC Border Commercial
Zones.	Persons of Mexico providing
bus service are not required to obtain
an ICC certificate of registration to
provide such service within the ICC
Border Commercial Zones.

A person providing bus or truck
service between points in the United
States is required to use United
States-registered and either U.S.-
built or duty-paid equipment.

Investment

The moratorium has the effect of being
an investment restriction because
enterprises of the United States
providing bus or truck services that
are owned or controlled by persons of
Mexico may not obtain ICC operating
authority.

DURATION: On entry into force of this Agreement, the Description shall govern.
	  Cross-Border Services

A person of Mexico will be permitted
to obtain operating authority to
provide:

(a)  three years after signature of
  this Agreement, cross-border
  truck services to or from border
  states (California, Arizona, New
  Mexico, and Texas), and such
  persons will be permitted to
  enter and depart the territory of
  United States through different
  ports of entry;

(b)  three years after entry into
  force of this Agreement,
  cross-border scheduled bus
  services; and

(c)  six years after entry into force
  of this Agreement, cross-border
  truck services.


Investment

A person of Mexico will be permitted
to establish an enterprise in the
United States to provide:

(a)  three years after signature of
  this Agreement, truck services
  for the distribution of
  international cargo between
  points in the United States; and

(b)  seven years after entry into
  force of this Agreement, bus
  services between points in the
  United States.

Indeterminate:	The moratorium will
remain in place on grants of authority
for the provision of truck services by
persons of Mexico between points in
the United States for the
transportation of goods other than
international cargo.

		Parliament on 18 June 1992)

DESCRIPTION: Investment

1.     Under the Investment Canada Act,
the following acquisitions of Canadian
businesses by "non-Canadians" are
subject to review by Investment
Canada:

(1)  all direct acquisitions of
  Canadian businesses with assets
  of $5 million or more;

(2)  all indirect acquisitions of
  Canadian businesses with assets
  of $50 million or more; and

(3)  indirect acquisitions of Canadian
  businesses with assets between $5
  million and $50 million which
  represent more than 50 percent of
  the value, calculated in the
  prescribed manner, of the assets
  of all the entities the control
  of which is being acquired,
  directly or indirectly, in the
  transaction in question.

2.     "Canadian business", "Canadian"
and "non-Canadian" are defined in the
Investment Canada Act.	A "non-
Canadian" is an individual, government
or agency thereof or an entity which
is not "Canadian".

3.     In addition, specific
acquisitions or new businesses in
designated types of business
activities related to Canada's
cultural heritage or national
identity, which are normally
notifiable, may be reviewed if the
Governor in Council authorizes a
review in the public interest.

4.     Investments subject to review
under the Investment Canada Act are
not to be implemented unless the
Minister responsible for the
Investment Canada Act advises the
applicant that the investment is
likely to be of net benefit to Canada.
Such a determination is made in
accordance with six factors described
in the Act.

5.     These factors are summarized as
follows:

(a)  the effect of the investment on
  the level and nature of economic
  activity in Canada, including the
  effect on employment, on the
  utilization of parts, components
  and services produced in Canada,
  and on exports from Canada;

(b)  the degree and significance of
  participation by Canadians in the
  investment;

(c)  the effect of the investment on
  productivity, industrial
  efficiency, technological
  development and product
  innovation in Canada;

(d)  the effect of the investment on
  competition within any industry
  or industries in Canada;

(e)  the compatibility of the
  investment with national
  industrial, economic and cultural
  policies, taking into
  consideration industrial,
  economic and cultural policy
  objectives enunciated by the
  government or legislature of any
  province likely to be
  significantly affected by the
  investment; and

(f)  the contribution of the
  investment to Canada's ability to
  compete in world markets.

6.     In making a net benefit
determination, the Minister, through
Investment Canada, may review plans
under which the applicant demonstrates
the net benefit to Canada of the
proposed acquisition.  An applicant
may also submit undertakings to the
Minister in connection with any
proposed acquisition which is the
subject of review.  In the event of
noncompliance with an undertaking by
an applicant, the Minister may seek a
court order directing compliance or
any other remedy authorized under the
Act.

7.     The establishment or acquisition
of Canadian businesses by non-
Canadians, other than those described
above, are to be notified to the
agency administering the Act,
Investment Canada.

8.     Review of "acquisition of
control", as defined in the Investment
Canada Act, of a Canadian business by
an American or Mexican will take place
if the value of the gross assets of
the Canadian business is not less than
the applicable thresholds, effective
on the date of entry into force of
this Agreement and adjusted on each
anniversary thereof.  The calculation
of the applicable review threshold is
set out in the Duration section below.

9.     The review threshold applicable
to American and Mexican investors is
higher than those set out above.
However, this higher review threshold
does not apply in the following
sectors:  uranium production and
ownership of uranium producing
properties; oil and gas; financial
services; transportation services and
cultural businesses.

10.	Indirect "acquisitions of
control", as defined in the Investment
Canada Act, of Canadian businesses by
"American" and "Mexican" investors are
not reviewable.  Notwithstanding the
definition of "investor of a Party" in
Chapter Eleven, only investors who are
nationals, or entities controlled by
nationals, (as defined in the
Investment Canada Act) of the United
States or Mexico, may benefit from the
higher review threshold.

11.	Notwithstanding Article 1106(1),
Canada reserves the right to impose
requirements, or enforce any
commitment or undertaking, in
connection with the establishment,
acquisition, expansion, conduct or
operation of an investment of an
investor of another Party for the
transfer of technology, production
process or other proprietary knowledge
to a national or enterprise,
affiliated to the transferor, in
Canada, in connection with the review
of an acquisition of an investment
pursuant to the Investment Canada Act.

12.	Except for requirements,
commitments or undertakings related to
technology transfer as set out above,
Article 1106(1) shall apply to
requirements, commitments or
undertakings imposed or enforced under
the Investment Canada Act.  However,
Article 1106(1) shall not be construed
to apply to any requirement,
commitment or undertaking imposed or
enforced in connection with a review
under the Investment Canada Act, to
locate production, carry out research
and development, employ or train
workers, or to construct or expand
particular facilities, in Canada.

DURATION: Paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 of the
Description setting out Canada's
reservations and commitments with
respect to Articles 1102,  1106(1),
and 1138 shall govern.

For American and Mexican investors,
the applicable threshold for the
review of a direct acquisition of
control of a Canadian business shall
be:

(a)  for the twelve month period
  commencing on the date of entry
  into force of this Agreement,
  such monetary amount as
  determined in accordance with
  Annex 1607.3 of the Canada-United
  State Free Trade Agreement;

(b)  commencing on the first
  anniversary of the date of entry
  into force of this Agreement, the
  monetary amount for the preceding
  year multiplied by an annual
  adjustment representing the
  increase in nominal Gross
  Domestic Product, as set out
  below.

The calculation of the annual
adjustment shall be determined in
January of each year after 1994 using
the most recently available data as
published by Statistics Canada and
using the following formula:

Ann																															    ual Adjustment =

     Current nominal GDP at market
     prices
     ---------------------------------
    ----------------------Previous
    year nominal GDP at market prices

"Current nominal GDP at market prices"
means the arithmetic mean of the
nominal Gross Domestic Product at
market prices for the most recent four
consecutive quarters (seasonally
adjusted at annual rates).

"Previous year nominal GDP at market
prices" means the arithmetic mean of
the nominal Gross Domestic Product at
market prices for the four consecutive
quarters (seasonally adjusted at
annual rates) for the comparable
period in the year preceding the year
used in calculating the "current
nominal GDP at market prices".

The amounts determined in this manner
shall be rounded to the nearest
million dollars.

DESCRIPTION: Investment

The Canada Business Corporations Act
requires that a simple majority of

to apply for Canadian citizenship.

In the case of a holding corporation,
not more than 1/3 of the directors
need be resident Canadians if the
earnings in Canada of the holding
corporation and its subsidiaries are
less than 5% of the gross earnings of
the holding corporation and its
subsidiaries.

Under the Canada Corporations Act, a
simple majority of the elected
directors of a Special Act corporation
must be residents of Canada and

DESCRIPTION: Investment

Canadian legislation contains certain
qualifications for holders of oil and
gas production licenses for
discoveries made after March 5, 1982.
These qualifications ensure that
holders of such licenses, or shares
therein, are Canadian citizens
ordinarily resident in Canada,
permanent residents or corporations
incorporated in Canada.

Notwithstanding qualification to hold
a production license, no production
license shall be issued for
discoveries made after March 5, 1982
unless the Minister of Energy, Mines
and Resources is satisfied that the
Canadian ownership rate of the
interest-owner in relation to the
production license on the date of
issuance would not be less than 50%.
"Interest-owner" is defined in the
Canada Petroleum Resources Act to mean
"an interest holder who holds the
interest or a group of interest
holders who hold all the shares of the
interest".

With respect to production licenses
for discoveries made prior to March 5,
1982, the Canadian ownership
requirements are as set out in the
Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations.

These qualifications and Canadian
ownership requirements are in respect
of production licenses issued on
"frontier lands" and the "offshore
areas" (areas not under provincial
jurisdiction) as defined in the
legislation.

The following "commercial air
services" are reserved to Canadian air
carriers or operators:	domestic air
transportation services (cabotage);
international scheduled air
transportation services reserved by
bilateral agreements to Canadian
airlines; and international
non-scheduled air transportation
services between Canada and a country
other than a foreign air carrier's
state of registry ("fifth freedom
charters").  For specialty air
services, see Schedule of Canada,
Annex I, p.I-C-42 and Schedule of
Canada, Annex II, p.II-C-9.

Only qualified persons may provide
commercial air services reserved to
Canadian air carriers or operators.
Non-Canadian investment in voting
stock of enterprises providing
commercial air services that are
reserved to Canadian air carriers or
operators is limited to 25% or to a
lesser percentage where control in
fact of the enterprise is otherwise
considered not to be held by
Canadians.  Non-Canadians are not
permitted, through voting interests or
other forms of investment, to control
Canadian air carriers or operators.
Aircraft other than state aircraft may
only be registered in Canada by
qualified persons.  Aircraft not
registered in Canada are limited by
regulation concerning the period
during which they may be operated in
Canada by Canadians.

A qualified person is a Canadian
citizen or permanent resident, or a
corporation incorporated by or under
the laws of Canada or a province and
of which:

(a)  not less than 75 % of the voting
  interest is in fact owned and
  controlled by Canadian citizens
  or permanent residents or by a
  corporation meeting the
  requirements on Canadian
  ownership and control;

(b)  not less than 2/3 of its
  directors are Canadian citizens
  or permanent residents;

(c)  the executive head is a Canadian
  citizen or permanent resident;
  and

(d)  the principal place of business
  is in Canada.

A corporation incorporated by or under
the laws of Canada or a province but
that does not meet the Canadian
ownership and control requirements may
only register a private aircraft when
the corporation is the sole owner and
subject to other limitations and
requirements of the Air Regulations.

The Air Regulations also have the
effect of limiting "non-Canadian"
corporations operating foreign
registered private aircraft within
Canada to the carriage of their own
employees. A "non-Canadian"
corporation is a corporation which
does not meet the Canadian ownership
and control requirements.

All commercial air services operating
in Canada require a Canadian operating
certificate to ensure their safety and
security.  An operating certificate
authorizing the provision of
commercial air services reserved to
Canadian operators or air carriers is
only issued to qualified persons.

1.     Under the Canada Oil and Gas
Operations Act, the Minister of
Energy, Mines and Resources requires
the applicant to submit a "benefits
plan".	Approval of the benefits plan
is required to receive authorization
to proceed with any oil and gas
development project.

2.     A "benefits plan" means a plan
for the employment of Canadians and
for providing Canadian manufacturers,
consultants, contractors and service
companies with a full and fair
opportunity to participate on a
competitive basis in the supply of
goods and services used in any
proposed work or activity referred to
in the benefits plan.  The Act permits
the Minister to impose an additional
requirement on the applicant, as part
of the benefits plan, to ensure that
disadvantaged individuals or groups
have access to training and employment
opportunities or can participate in
the supply of goods and services used
in any proposed work referred to in
the benefits plan.  Similar provisions
will be included in the Yukon and

Implementation Act and the Canada-
Newfoundland Atlantic Accord
Implementation Act have the same
requirement for a "benefits plan" but
also require that the "benefits plan"
ensure that:

(a)  before carrying out any work or
  activity in the offshore area the
  corporation or other body
  submitting the plan shall
  establish in the Province an
  office where appropriate levels
  of decision-making are to take
  place;

(b)  expenditures shall be made for
  research and development to be
  carried out in the Province, and
  for education and training to be
  provided in the Province; and

(c)  first consideration shall be
  given to goods produced or
  services provided from within the
  Province, where those goods or
  services are competitive in terms
  of fair market price, quality and
  delivery.

4.     The Boards administering the
benefits plan under these Acts may
also require that the plan include
provisions to ensure that
disadvantaged individuals or groups or
corporations owned or cooperatives
operated by them participate in the
supply of goods and services used in
any proposed work or activity referred
in the benefits plan.

5.     In addition, Canada reserves the
right to impose any requirement or
enforce any commitment or undertaking
for the transfer of technology, a
production process or other
proprietary knowledge to a national or
enterprise in Canada, in connection
with the approval of development
projects under the Acts cited above.

intended for industrial and tourist
activities in the Restricted Zone for
a period not to exceed 30 years.

The trust is renewable if:

  which is to be extinguished or
  terminated will be beneficiaries
  of the new trust;

  under the same terms and
  conditions as the trust which is

DESCRIPTION: The United States will ensure that in
considering applications for a grant
of authority to transmit programming
to foreign stations for retransmission
into the United States under Section
325 of the Communications Act of 1934
(the Act), the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) will not consider the
nationality of the affected stations
for the purpose of favoring a U.S.
station that is competing with a
Mexican station for affiliation with a
U.S. programmer. Rather the FCC will
apply the criteria for the grant of
such permit in the same manner as
would be applied to a domestic
broadcast station application under
Section 309 of the Act.

In addition, the term of the Section
325 permit shall be extended from one
year to five years in all situations
where it can be assured that the
retransmitting station is and will be
in full compliance with applicable
treaties. In assessing the public
interest, convenience, and necessity
required by the Act for the grant of
authorization under Section 325, the
primary criterion will be avoiding the
creation or maintenance of electrical
interference to U.S. broadcast
stations that violates applicable
treaty provisions. In evaluating this
and any other criteria permitted under
Section 309, the U.S. will ensure that
the Section 325 process shall not be
conducted in a manner that would
constitute an unnecessary restriction
on trade.

DESCRIPTION: Federal authorities may not approve
the establishment of, or acquisition
of an interest in, a bank subsidiary
within a state ("the host state") by a
foreign bank that has a full-service
branch or bank subsidiary in the
United States, unless the measures of
the host state expressly permit the
transaction.  Thus, foreign banks may
not acquire interests in banks in some
states on the same basis as domestic
bank holding companies from the
foreign bank's home state.  For
purposes of determining national
treatment under paragraph 6(b) of
Article 1407, foreign banks are
located in their "home state," as that
term is used in the International
Banking Act of 1978.

The following types of measures, inter
alia, fall into this category:

     (a) Foreign banks are expressly
 excluded from the authority
 to own banks in certain
 regional holding company
 laws.

     (b) Foreign banks
 are implicitly excluded through a
definition of eligible owner
in certain state laws that
requires a majority of the
parent bank's deposits to be
in the United States, in a
particular region of the
United States, or in a
particular state.

     (c) Foreign banks
 that do not already own a
 banking subsidiary in
 the United States are
 interpreted as not qualifying
 as an eligible "bank holding
 company" entitled to own
 a bank.

Affiliates that have the effect of evading the capital limits set
forth in the Schedule of Mexico.  This subparagraph does not
apply to bona fide transfers of funds to make overnight deposits
or bona fide transfers of banking liabilities.

4.   A Foreign Financial Affiliate shall not issue subordinated
debentures, except to its parent outside of Mexico.

5.   The aggregate of the authorized capital of all Foreign
Financial Affiliates of the same type, measured as a percentage
of the aggregate capital of all financial institutions of such
type in Mexico, shall not exceed the percentage set forth in the
chart in this paragraph 5 for that type of institution, except
for the case of insurance which is addressed in paragraph 6 of
this Part B.  Beginning one year after the entry into force of
the Agreement, these initial limits shall increase annually in
equal increments so as to reach the final limits specified in the
chart in this paragraph 5 at the beginning of the last year of
the Transition Period.


Type of Financial Institution	Percentage of Total Capital
			       Initial	 Final
			       Limit	      Limit

     Commercial banks		      8%	    15%
     Securities firms		     10%	    20%
     Factoring companies	     10%	    20%
     Leasing companies		     10%	    20%

Any capital in existence as of the date of signature of this
Agreement of a foreign bank branch established in Mexico prior to
such date shall be excluded from each of the aggregate capital
limits referred to in the Schedule of Mexico.

6.   In the case of insurance, the aggregate of the authorized
capital of all Foreign Insurance Affiliates, measured as a
percentage of the aggregate capital of all insurance companies in
Mexico, shall not exceed the percentage set forth in the chart in
this paragraph 6 for the respective one-year periods beginning on
each of the following dates:

	  Date			   Percentage of Total Capital

     January 1, 1994				6%
     January 1, 1995				8%
     January 1, 1996				9%
     January 1, 1997			       10%
     January 1, 1998			       11%
     January 1, 1999			       12%

If the entry into force of the Agreement occurs on a date prior
to January 1, 1994, that date shall become the initial date for
purposes of this chart, and each succeeding anniversary of the
entry into force of the Agreement shall become the next
succeeding date in this chart, with the percentages listed in
this chart applying to each of the respective periods as so
adjusted.  If the entry into force of the Agreement occurs on a
date after January 1, 1994, the dates and corresponding limits in
this chart shall nonetheless not be changed.

The individual and aggregate capital limits described in
paragraphs 2 and 6 of this Part B shall be measured separately
(through separate accounting) for life and non-life insurance
operations; but both types of insurance operations may be
conducted either by a single or separate Foreign Financial
Affiliates.

7.   Insurance providers of another Party may elect an
alternative procedure for entering Mexico through phasing-in an
equity interest in a new or existing Mexican insurance company,
and thereby exempt such Mexican company from the capital limits
of paragraphs 2 and 6 of this Part B.  In order to qualify, the
percentage of the Mexican insurance company's voting common stock
that is owned by Mexican persons must not be less than the levels
set forth in the chart in this paragraph 7 for the respective
one-year periods beginning on each of the following dates:

	  Date		      Mexican Interest

     January 1, 1994		     70%
     January 1, 1995		     65%
     January 1, 1996		     60%
     January 1, 1997		     55%
     January 1, 1998		     49%
     January 1, 1999		     25%

If the entry into force of the Agreement occurs on a date prior
to January 1, 1994, that date shall become the initial date for
purposes of this chart, and each succeeding anniversary of the
entry into force of the Agreement shall become the next
succeeding date in this chart, with the percentages listed in
this chart applying to each of the respective periods as so
adjusted.  If the entry into force of the Agreement occurs on a
date after January 1, 1994, the dates and corresponding limits in
this chart shall nonetheless not be changed.

On and after January 1, 2000 (or, if the entry into force of the
Agreement occurs on a date prior to January 1, 1994, on and after
the sixth anniversary of such date), the percentage requirement
of Mexican ownership set forth in this paragraph 7 shall no
longer apply.

This paragraph 7 is further modified by paragraph 4 of Part C of
the Schedule of Mexico to the extent set forth therein.

8.   The aggregate assets of Foreign Financial Affiliates that
are limited scope financial institutions within the meaning of
paragraph 2 of Part C of the Schedule of Mexico shall not exceed
3% of the sum of (1) the aggregate assets of all commercial banks
in Mexico plus (2) the aggregate assets of all types of limited
scope financial institutions in Mexico.  Lending by affiliates of
automobile manufacturing companies with respect to their vehicles
shall not be subject to or taken into account in determining
compliance with this 3% limit.

9.   The capital limits in paragraphs 2, 5, 6 and 8 of this Part
B shall be removed at the end of the Transition Period.  If the
sum of the authorized capital of Foreign Financial Affiliates,
measured as a percentage of the aggregate capital of all
financial institutions of such type in Mexico, reaches the
percentage set forth in the chart in this paragraph 9 for such
type of institutions, then Mexico shall have the right, once
during the four years following the end of the Transition Period,
to freeze such aggregate capital percentage at its then-existing
level:

     Commercial banks			 25%
     Securities firms			 30%

If applied, such a restriction will have a duration not to exceed
a period of 3 years.

10.  No additional license to establish a Foreign Financial
Affiliate shall be granted during the Transition Period (and, in
the case of paragraph 9 of this Part B, during the additional
periods described in that paragraph) if after such issuance the
sum of the authorized capital of all Foreign Financial Affiliates
of the same type would exceed the applicable percentage limit for
that type of institution in paragraph 5, 6, 8 or 9 of this
Part B.


OTHER EXCEPTIONS

11.  The provisions of the following paragraphs 12 through 15 of
this Part B shall apply immediately upon the entry into force of
the Agreement and at all times thereafter, except as otherwise
specifically provided in such paragraphs.  Any amendment or
modification to a measure adopted or maintained pursuant to
paragraphs 12 through 15 of this Part B shall not decrease the
conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before such
amendment or modification, with Articles 1404 to 1409 of the
Agreement.

Reservation to Article 1407

12.  Mexico may require that a Foreign Financial Affiliate (other
than a Foreign Insurance Affiliate) be wholly-owned by a
financial service provider of another Party (except for
directors' nominal qualifying shares).	Mexico may also restrict
any Foreign Financial Affiliate from establishing agencies,
branches, or other direct or indirect subsidiaries in the
territory of any other country.

Reservations to Articles 1404 and 1407

13.  Following the Transition Period, acquisition of a commercial
bank established in Mexico, or of the assets or liabilities
thereof, by a financial service provider of another Party will
only be authorized by Mexico, subject to reasonable prudential
considerations on a case by case basis, if the sum of the
authorized capital of the acquired commercial bank and the
authorized capital of any commercial bank in Mexico already
controlled by the acquiror would not exceed 4% of the aggregate
capital of all commercial banks in Mexico.

14.  Mexico may adopt measures that (i) limit eligibility to
establish a Foreign Financial Affiliate in Mexico to a financial
service provider of another Party that is, directly or through
any of its affiliates, engaged in the same general type of
financial services in the territory of the other Party; and (ii)
limit such provider (together with its affiliates) to no more
than one institution of the same type in Mexico.  In determining
what types of operations a financial service provider of another
Party is engaged in for purposes of the preceding sentence, all
types of insurance shall be considered to be only one type of
financial service; but both life and non-life insurance
operations may be conducted either by a single or separate
Foreign Financial Affiliates.

Reservation to Articles 1404, 1405 and 1407

15.  The existing activities and operations of Mexican
governmental insurance programs conducted by Aseguradora
Mexicana, S.A. or Aseguradora Hidalgo, S.A. (including insurance
for government employees, agencies, instrumentalities and public
entities) are excluded from Articles 1404, 1405 and 1407 for so
long as such firm is controlled by the government of Mexico and
for a commercially reasonable time after such governmental
control ceases.

Reservation to Article 1405

16.  In order not to impair the conduct of Mexico's monetary and
exchange rate policies, non-resident financial service providers
of another Party shall not be permitted to provide financial
services into the territory of Mexico or to residents of Mexico,
and residents of Mexico may not purchase financial services from
non-resident financial service providers of another Party, if
such transactions are denominated in Mexican pesos.

Reservation to Articles 1404-1409

17.  The benefits of this Agreement shall not be extended to a
foreign bank branch existing in Mexico on the date of entry into
force of this Agreement.  The existing legal regime will continue
to apply to such a branch for so long as it operates in that
form.  Such a branch shall be permitted to convert to a
subsidiary pursuant to the terms of this Schedule, and upon
conversion shall be covered by this Agreement.	The existing
capital of such branch on the date of signature of this Agreement
shall not be counted against such Foreign Commercial Bank
Affiliate's individual capital limit, or the aggregate capital
limits for commercial banks in the event of conversion.

				 ANNEX VII

				  PART C

			    Schedule of Mexico


SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS

1.   Mexico shall retain discretion to approve, on a case-by-case
basis, any affiliation of a commercial bank or securities firm
with a commercial or industrial corporation that has a commercial
presence in Mexico, if Mexico determines that such affiliation is
harmless and, in the case of banking, either (a) not substantial,
or (b) the financial-related activities of the commercial or
industrial commercial corporation are at least 90 percent of its
annual income worldwide, and the non-financial activities of such
commercial or industrial corporation are of a type that Mexico
determines to be acceptable.  Affiliation with a non-resident
commercial or industrial corporation that has no commercial
presence in Mexico will not be a reason for denial of an
application to establish or acquire a commercial bank or
securities firm in Mexico.

2.   Non-bank financial service providers of another Party shall
be permitted to establish one or more limited scope financial
institutions in Mexico to provide separately consumer lending,
commercial lending, mortgage lending or credit card services on
terms no less favorable than those applied to like domestic firms
under Mexican measures.  Mexico may permit lending services
closely related to the principal authorized business of a limited
scope financial institution to be carried out by that
institution.  Such firms shall be provided the opportunity to
raise funds in the securities market for business operations
subject to normal terms and conditions.  Mexico may restrict such
limited scope financial institutions from taking deposits.

3.   Within two years of the entry into force of the Agreement,
Mexico shall conduct a study of the desirability and, if
desirable, the possible methods of establishing limited scope
securities firms which would have more limited powers than
current securities firms.  Such limited scope securities firms
would be subject to differing capital requirements, depending on
the type and extent of business conducted, that would permit
lower minimum capital requirements than those currently
applicable to Mexican securities firms.  The basis of the study
would be prudential considerations and opportunities for
investment in the securities sector.  As part of the second
annual meeting of the Committee required under Article 1414,
Mexico shall report to the other Parties on the outcome of the
study, including any plans for the establishment of new
categories of securities firms.

4.   Notwithstanding Part B (paragraph 7) of the Schedule of
Mexico, an insurance provider of another Party, together with its
affiliates, that as of July 1, 1992 collectively have an active
investment or ownership interest that has been specifically
approved by the Mexico of 10% or more in a Mexican insurance
company may:  (1) exercise any contract right or option in
existence as of July 1, 1992 with respect to ownership interests
in such Mexican insurance company; and (2) effective the earlier
of January 1, 1996 or two years following the date of entry into
force of the Agreement, acquire a controlling interest of up to
100% in such Mexican insurance company.  Before the effective
date described in clause (2) of the preceding sentence, an
insurance provider of another Party (together with its
affiliates) described in that sentence may exercise any existing
contract right or option described in clause (1) of that
sentence, and choose to maintain its existing interest or expand
its interest in such Mexican insurance company to the extent
consistent with Part B (paragraph 7) of the Schedule of Mexico.
Mexico shall maintain discretion to permit acceleration of the
schedule for equity participation in a Mexican insurance company
by an insurance provider of another Party described in the first
sentence of this paragraph.

5.   A bank or securities provider of another Party that is
authorized to and establishes or acquires a commercial bank or
securities firm, respectively, in Mexico may also establish a
financial holding company in Mexico, and thereby establish or
acquire other types of financial institutions in Mexico, under
the terms of Mexican measures.

6.   Mexico shall administer its licensing and approval
procedures during the Transition Period (as defined in Part B of
the Schedule of Mexico) in a manner that does not deny the
benefits of the liberalization of existing measures described in
the Schedule of Mexico to enterprises of another Party ultimately
controlled by nationals of that Party.

			    Appendix B:  Mexico

     Auto Decree and Auto Decree Implementing Regulations

1.   Subject to this Appendix, Mexico may maintain, until January
1, 2004, the Decree for Development and Modernization of the
Automotive Industry ("Decreto para el Fomento y Modernizacicn de
la Industria Automotriz") (December 11, 1989) (the "Auto Decree")
and the Resolution that Establishes Rules for the Implementation
of the Auto Decree ("Acuerdo que Determina Reglas para la
Aplicacicn para el Fomento y Modernizacicn de la Industria
Automotriz") (November 30, 1990) (the "Auto Decree Implementing
Regulations").	Mexico may adopt or maintain any measure
respecting automotive goods or manufacturers of automotive goods
in its territory provided that such measure is not inconsistent
with this Agreement.

     Autoparts Industry, National Suppliers and Independent
Maquiladoras

2.   Mexico may not require that an enterprise attain a level of
national value added in excess of 20 percent of its total sales
as one of the conditions to qualify as a national supplier or
enterprise of the autoparts industry.

2a.  For purposes of paragraph 2, "national value added" means
the total value of sales of such enterprises (excluding those for
the aftermarket) minus the value of its total imports, direct and
indirect, excluding those imports incorporated in aftermarket
parts and components, as modified by paragraph 3.

3.   Mexico may require that a national supplier or an enterprise
of the autoparts industry, in calculating its national value
added solely for the purposes of paragraph 2, include customs
duties in the value of imports incorporated into the parts and
components produced by such enterprises.

4.   Mexico shall grant national supplier status to an
independent maquiladora that requests such status and meets the
requirements for that status set out in the existing Auto Decree.
Mexico shall continue to grant to all independent maquiladoras
that request national supplier status all existing rights and
privileges accorded to independent maquiladoras under the
existing Decree for the Promotion and Operation of the
Maquiladora Export Industry ("Decreto para el Fomento y Operacicn
de la Industria Maquiladora de Exportacicn") (December 22, 1989)
(the "Maquiladora Decree").

4a.  For purposes of paragraph 4, "independent maquiladora" means
an enterprise registered as an export maquiladora enterprise
under the Maquiladora Decree which has no common majority
shareholder with any manufacturer, and for which no manufacturer
is directly or indirectly a majority shareholder.

     National Value Added

5.   Mexico may provide that a manufacturer ("empresa de la
industria terminal") calculate its required national value added
from suppliers (VANp) as a percentage of:

     (a) a manufacturer's reference value as defined in
 paragraph 8; or

     (b) a manufacturer's total national value added (VANt),

whichever is greater.

6.   Mexico shall not require that the percentage referred to in
paragraph 5 be greater than:

     (a) 34 percent for each of the first five years beginning
 January 1, 1994;

     (b) 33 percent for 1999;

     (c) 32 percent for 2000;

     (d) 31 percent for 2001;

     (e) 30 percent for 2002; and

     (f) 29 percent for 2003.

7.   Notwithstanding paragraph 6, Mexico shall allow a
manufacturer that produced vehicles in Mexico before model year
1992 to use as its percentage referred to in paragraph 5 the
ratio of actual national value added from suppliers (VANp) to
total national value added (VANt) that such manufacturer attained
in model year 1992, for so long as that ratio is lower than the
applicable percentage specified under paragraph 6.  In
determining such ratio for 1992, purchases that such manufacturer
made from independent maquiladoras that would have been eligible
to receive national supplier status had paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of
this Appendix been in effect at that time, shall be included in
the calculation of the manufacturer's national value added from
suppliers (VANp), in the same manner as parts and components from
any other national supplier or enterprise of the autoparts
industry.

8.   "The annual reference value for a manufacturer" ("reference
value") shall be:

     (a) for each of the years 1994 through 1997, the base value
 for the manufacturer, plus no more than 65 percent of
 the difference between the manufacturer's total sales
 in Mexico in that year and its base value;

     (b) for each of the years 1998 through 2000, the base value
 for the manufacturer, plus no more than 60 percent of
 the difference between the manufacturer's total sales
 in Mexico in that year and its base value; and

     (c) for each of the years 2001 through 2003, the base value
 for the manufacturer, plus no more than 50 percent of
 the difference between the manufacturer's total sales
 in Mexico in that year and its base value.

9.   Mexico shall provide that where a manufacturer's total sales
in Mexico in a year are lower than its base value, the reference
value for such manufacturer for that year shall be equal to the
manufacturer's total value of sales in Mexico for the year.

9a.  For purposes of paragraphs 8 and 9:

     (a) "base value" means the average annual value of the
 manufacturer's production in Mexico for sale in Mexico
 (VTVd) in model years 1991 and 1992, adjusted for
 inflation, using the Mexican producer price index for
 automotive goods published by the Bank of Mexico
 ("Banco de Mexico"); and

     (b) "manufacturer's total sales in Mexico in that year"
 means the invoice value of sales by a manufacturer of
 vehicles it produced in Mexico for sale in Mexico plus
 the invoice value of its sales of imported vehicles.

10.  In the event an abnormal production disruption affects a
manufacturer's production capability, Mexico shall allow such
manufacturer to seek a reduction in its reference value before
the Intersecretariat Automotive Industry Commission, established
under Chapter V of the Auto Decree.  If the Commission finds that
the production capability of the manufacturer has been impaired
by such an abnormal production disruption, the Commission shall
reduce the manufacturer's reference value in an amount
commensurate to such event.

10a. For purposes of paragraph 10, "abnormal production
disruption" means a disruption in a manufacturer's production
capability resulting from a natural disaster, fire, explosion or
other unforeseen event beyond the manufacturer's control.

11.  If, upon the request of a manufacturer, the Intersecretariat
Automotive Industry Commission finds that the production
capability of such manufacturer has been significantly disrupted
as a result of a major retooling or plant conversion in the
facilities of the manufacturer, the Commission shall reduce the
reference value for the manufacturer for that year in an amount
commensurate with the disruption, provided that such reduction in
that manufacturer's required national value added from suppliers
(VANp) that may result from the Commission's determination to
lower the manufacturer's reference value shall be fully made up
by the manufacturer over the following two model years.

11a.  For purposes of paragraph 11, "significant disruption"
means a sizable impairment in the manufacturer's production
capability that lasts at least six months but no longer than 12
months.

     Trade Balance

12.  Mexico shall not require a manufacturer to include in the
calculation of its trade balance (S) a percentage of the value of
direct and indirect imports of parts and components that such
manufacturer incorporated into vehicles it has produced in Mexico
for sale in Mexico (VTVd) in the corresponding year, greater than
the following:

     (a) 80 percent for 1994;

     (b) 77.2 percent for 1995;

     (c) 74.4 percent for 1996;

     (d) 71.6 percent for 1997;

     (e) 68.9 percent for 1998;

     (f) 66.1 percent for 1999;

     (g) 63.3 percent for 2000;

     (h) 60.5 percent for 2001;

     (i) 57.7 percent for 2002; and

     (j) 55.0 percent for 2003.

13.  For purposes of determining a manufacturer's total national
value added (VANt), paragraph 12 shall not apply to the
calculation of its trade balance (S).

14.  Mexico shall permit a manufacturer with a surplus in its
extended trade balance to divide its extended trade balance by
the applicable percentages in paragraph 12 to determine the value
of new vehicles that it may import.

15.  Mexico shall provide that in the calculation of a
manufacturer's adjustment factor (Y) in its extended trade
balance:

     (a) a manufacturer's total national value added (VANt) be
 replaced by that manufacturer's reference value in any
 year in which the manufacturer's total national value
 added (VANt) is lower than its reference value; and

     (b) the applicable percentage under paragraphs 6 or 7, as
 appropriate, be used.

16.  In determining the annual amount that a manufacturer may
apply to its extended trade balance from surpluses earned prior
to model year 1991, Mexico shall in any given year allow such
manufacturer to elect:

     (a) to use the procedures of the existing Auto Decree
 Implementing Regulation; or

     (b) to apply up to $US 150 million, adjusted for inflation
 in accordance with the U.S. GDP Price Deflator or its
 equivalent in Mexican pesos,

until such surpluses have been exhausted.

     Other Restrictions in the Auto Decree

17.  Mexico shall eliminate the restriction set out in the
existing Auto Decree that limits the number of vehicles that a
manufacturer may import into Mexico in relation to the total
number of vehicles that such manufacturer sells in Mexico.

     Autotransportation Decree and Autotransportation
Implementing Regulations

18.  Mexico shall eliminate the Mexican Decree for Development
and Modernization of the Autotransportation Vehicle Manufacturing
Industry (December 1989) ("Decreto para el Fomento y
Modernizacicn de la Industria Manufacturera de Vehiculos de
Autotransporte") (the "Autotransportation Decree") and the
Resolution that Establishes Rules for the Implementation of the
Autotransportation Decree (November 1990) ("Acuerdo que Establece

(the "Autotransportation Decree Implementing Regulations").
Mexico may adopt or maintain any measure respecting
autotransportation vehicles or manufacturers of
autotransportation vehicles in its territory provided that such
measure is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

     Importation of Autotransportation Vehicles

19.  Except as provided in paragraphs 20 and 21, Mexico may adopt
or maintain a prohibition or restriction on the importation of
autotransportation vehicles of another Party until January 1,
1999.

20.  For each of the years 1994 through 1998, Mexico shall allow
any manufacturer of autotransportation vehicles to import, for
each type of autotransportation vehicle, a quantity of
originating autotransportation vehicles equal to at least 50
percent of the number of vehicles of such type that such
manufacturer produced in Mexico in that year.

20a.  For purposes of paragraph 20, "manufacturer of
autotransportation vehicles" means an enterprise, established in
Mexico, that produces autotransportation vehicles, is registered
with the Ministry of Trade and Industrial Development
("Secretaria de Comercia y Fomento Industrial"), and whose sales
in Mexico incorporate at least 40 percent national value added,
where national value added is the result of subtracting from the
total sales (excluding imports of autotransportation vehicles) of
an autotransportation manufacturer the invoice value of its
direct and indirect imports of parts and components.

21.  For each of the years 1994 through 1998, Mexico shall allow
persons other than manufacturers of autotransportation vehicles
to import, in a quantity to be allocated among them, originating
autotransportation vehicles of each type as follows:

     (a) for each of the years 1994 and 1995, no less than 15
 percent of the total number of vehicles of each type of
 autotransportation vehicle produced in Mexico;

     (b) for 1996, no less than 20 percent of the total number
 of vehicles of each type of autotransportation vehicle
 produced in Mexico; and

     (c) for each of the years 1997 and 1998, no less than 30
 percent of the total number of vehicles of each type of
 autotransportation vehicle produced in Mexico.

Mexico shall allocate such quantity through a non-discriminatory
auction.

2.   In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and
the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles
(Multifiber Arrangement), as amended and extended, including any
amendment or extension after the date of entry into force of this
Agreement, or any other existing or future agreement applicable
to trade in textile or apparel goods, this Agreement shall
prevail to the extent of the inconsistency, unless the Parties
agree otherwise.


Section 2:  Tariff Elimination

1.   Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement , each Party
shall progressively eliminate its customs duties on originating
goods as provided in its Schedule set out in Annex 302.2, in
accordance with Appendix 2.1.

2.   (a) For purposes of this Annex, a good shall be considered
 to be an originating good if the applicable change in
 tariff classification has been satisfied in the
 territory of one or more of the Parties, as provided by
 Article 404.

     (b) For purposes of determining which rate of duty and
 staging category is applicable to an originating
 textile or apparel good, a good shall be a good of the
 Party in which the last substantial transformation
 occurred, according to each importing Party's
 regulations, practices or procedures or, in the event
 of an agreement between the Parties pursuant to Annex

level on a textile or apparel good that otherwise would be
permitted under this Annex if the elimination of that restriction
is required as a result of integration of that good into the GATT
pursuant to commitments undertaken by that Party under any
successor agreement to the Multifiber Arrangement.


Section 4:  Bilateral Emergency Actions (Tariff Actions)

1.   During the transition period only, if, as a result of the
reduction or elimination of a duty provided for in this
Agreement, an originating textile or apparel good, or a good that
has been integrated into the GATT pursuant to a commitment
undertaken by a Party under any successor agreement to the
Multifiber Arrangement and entered under a tariff preference
level set out in Appendix 6.0, is being imported into the
territory of another Party in such increased quantities, in
absolute terms or relative to the domestic market for that good,
and under such conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual
threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or
directly competitive good, the importing Party may, to the extent
necessary to remedy the damage or actual threat thereof:

     (a) suspend the further reduction of any rate of duty
 provided for under this Agreement on such good; or

     (b) increase the rate of duty on such good to a level not
 to exceed the lesser of:

     (i) the most-favored-nation (MFN) applied rate of duty
 in effect at the time the action is taken, or

     (ii) the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on the day
 immediately preceding the date of entry into force
 of this Agreement.

2.   In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof, the
Party shall:

     (a) examine the effect of increased imports on the
 particular industry, as reflected in the following
 factors, none of which is necessarily decisive:
 changes in such relevant economic variables as output,
 productivity, utilization of capacity, inventories,
 market share, exports, wages, employment, domestic
 prices, profits and investment; and

 three years or, except with the consent of the Party
 against whose good the action is taken, have effect
 beyond the expiration of the transition period;

     (c) no action may be taken by a Party against any
 particular originating good more than once during the
 transition period; and

     (d) upon the termination of the action, the rate of duty
 shall be the rate that, according to the Schedule for
 that staged elimination of the tariff, would have been
 in effect a year after the commencement of the action,
 and commencing January 1 of the year following the
 termination of the action, at the option of the Party
 that has taken the action:

     (i) the rate of duty shall conform to the schedule in
 that Party's Schedule in Annex 302.2, or

     (ii) the tariff shall be eliminated in equal annual
 stages ending on the date set forth in that
 Party's Schedule in Annex 302.2 for the
 elimination of the tariff.

4.   A Party taking an action under this Section shall provide,
to the Party against whose good the action is taken, mutually
agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions
having substantially equivalent trade effects on the other Party,
or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to
result from the action.  Such concessions shall be limited to the
textile and apparel goods listed in Appendix 1.1, unless the
Parties otherwise agree.  If the concerned Parties are unable to
agree on compensation, the exporting Party may take tariff action
having trade effects substantially equivalent to the action taken
under this Section against any goods imported from the Party that
initiated the action pursuant to this Section.	The Party taking
such tariff action shall only apply it for the minimum period
necessary to achieve such substantially equivalent effects.


Section 5:  Bilateral Emergency Actions (Quantitative
Restrictions)

1.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement except
Appendix 5.2, a Party may take bilateral emergency action against
non-originating goods of another Party in accordance with this
Section and the provisions of Appendix 3.1.

2.   If a Party considers that non-originating textile and
apparel goods, including goods entered under the tariff
preference levels (TPLs) set out in Appendix 6.0, are being
imported into its territory from a Party in such increased
quantities, in absolute terms or relative to the domestic market,
so as to cause serious damage or actual threat thereof, to a
domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good
in the importing Party, that Party may request consultations with
another Party with a view to eliminating the serious damage or
actual threat thereof.

3.   The Party requesting consultations shall include in its
request for consultations the reasons that it considers
demonstrate that such serious damage or actual threat to its
domestic industry is resulting from the imports of the other
Party, including the latest data concerning such damage or
threat.

4.   In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof, the
Party shall apply the provisions of paragraph 2, Section 4.

5.   The concerned Parties shall commence consultations within 60
days following the request for consultations and shall endeavor
to agree on a mutually satisfactory level of restraint on exports
of the particular good within 90 days of the request, unless the
consulting Parties agree to extend this period.  In reaching a
mutually satisfactory level of export restraint, the consulting
Parties shall:

     (a) consider the situation in the market in the importing
 Party;

     (b) consider the history of trade in textile and apparel
 goods between the consulting Parties, including the
 previous levels of trade; and

     (c) ensure that textile and apparel goods imported from the
 territory of another Party are accorded equitable
 treatment as compared with treatment granted to other
 non-Party suppliers of like textile and apparel goods.

6.   If the Parties do not agree on a mutually satisfactory level
during the 90-day consultation period, the Party requesting
consultations may impose annual quantitative restrictions on
imports of the good from the territory of the other Party for a
period no longer than that provided for in paragraph 9, provided
that:

     (a) the measure shall not have effect beyond the transition
 period; and

     (b) the quantitative restriction shall not be less than the
 sum of

     (i) the quantity of the good imported into its
 territory from the Party that would be affected by
 the restriction, as reported in general import
 statistics, during the first 12 of the most recent
 14 months preceding the month in which the request
 for consultations was made, and

     (ii) an additional 20 percent of such quantity for
 cotton, man-made fiber and other non-cotton
 vegetable fiber good categories and six percent
 for wool good categories.

7.   The first term of any quantitative restriction imposed under
paragraph 6 shall commence on the day following the request for
consultations and terminate at the end of the calendar year in
which the quantitative restriction was imposed.  Any quantitative
restriction that is imposed for a term less than 12 months and
the applicable flexibility provisions shall be prorated to
correspond to the period of time remaining in the calendar year
in which the restriction is imposed.

8.   For each successive calendar year that the quantitative
restriction imposed under paragraph 6 remains in effect, the
Party imposing it shall:

     (a) increase by 6 percent restrictions on cotton, man-made
 fiber and non-cotton vegetable fiber textile and
 apparel goods and by 2 percent restrictions on wool
 textile and apparel goods;

     (b) accelerate the growth rate for quantitative
 restrictions on cotton, man-made fiber and non-cotton
 vegetable fiber textile and apparel goods if required
 by any successor agreement to the Multifiber
 Arrangement; and

     (c) apply the flexibility provisions set forth in Appendix
 3.1, as appropriate.

9.   Quantitative restrictions established pursuant to paragraph
6 before July 1 in any given calendar year may remain in place
for the initial prorated period in the first calendar year, plus
two additional calendar years.	Such restrictions established on
or after July 1 in any given calendar year may remain in place
for the initial prorated period plus three additional calendar
years.

10.  No Party may take an emergency action under this Section
with respect to any textile or apparel non-originating good that
is already subject to a quantitative restriction.

11.  No party may adopt or maintain a quantitative restriction
under this Section on a textile or apparel good if that good has
been integrated into the GATT as a result of commitments
undertaken by that Party pursuant to any successor agreement to
the Multifiber Arrangement.

12.  A Party may take a bilateral emergency action after the
expiration of the transition period to deal with cases of serious
damage to domestic industry arising from the operation of this
Agreement only with the consent of the Party against whose good
the action would be taken.


Section 6:  Special Provisions

     A Party shall treat the textile or apparel goods of another
Party set out in Appendix 6.0 in accordance with the provisions
therein.


Section 7:  Review and Revision of Rules of Origin

1.   (a) The Parties shall monitor the effects of the
 application of the rule of origin contained in Annex
 401.1 applicable to goods of subheading 6212.10.  No
 earlier than 15 months after the date of entry into
 force of this Agreement, any Party may request
 consultations to seek a mutually satisfactory solution
 to any difficulties that it considers results from the
 application of that rule of origin.

     (b) If the Parties fail to reach a mutually satisfactory
 solution through consultations within 90 days of a
 request for consultations, any Party may request that
 the rule applicable to subheading 6212.10 be changed to
 the rule applicable to headings 62.06 through 62.11 of
 the Harmonized System (HS) with respect to trade with
 the requesting Party.	Any such change shall be
 effective no earlier than 180 days following the
 request therefor.  The Parties shall take measures to
 ease any resulting administrative burden on producers.

     (c) Unless otherwise agreed, at any time after the initial
 consultations, and within the transition period of this
 Agreement, any Party may make one request for
 additional consultations under the same procedures
 provided in paragraphs (a) and (b).

2.   (a) At the request of any Party, the Parties shall consult
 to consider whether specific goods should be made
 subject to different rules of origin in order to
 address issues of availability of supply of fibers,
 yarns or fabrics within the free trade area.

     (b) In the consultations, each Party shall consider all
 data presented by a Party showing substantial
 production in its territory for a good submitted for
 review.  A legitimate claim of substantial production
 of the good in the territory of a Party shall be deemed
 to exist if that Party can show that its domestic
 producers are capable of supplying commercial
 quantities of the good in a timely manner.

     (c) The Parties shall make every effort to conclude
 consultations within sixty days.  Any agreement between
 two or more Parties resulting from these consultations
 shall be considered part of this Agreement.  If
 agreement is not reached, the Parties have recourse to
 the provisions of paragraph 8(a) of Appendix 6.6.

     (d) In this context, at the request of any Party, the
 Parties shall consult to consider whether the rules of
 origin applicable to the following provisions in Annex
 401.1 should be amended in view of increasing
 availability of supply of relevant yarns or fabrics
 within the free trade area;

     (i) Canadian tariff item 5407.60.10, United States
 tariff item 5407.60.22 and Mexican tariff item
 5407.60.02,

     (ii) provisions (i) through (viii) of the rule for
 subheadings 6205.20 through 6205.30,

     (iii) note 2 to Chapter 61,

     (iv) note 2 to Chapter 62, and

     (v) Canadian tariff item 6303.92.a1, United States
 tariff item 6303.92.h1 and Mexican tariff item
 6303.92.x1.

3.   The Parties shall review the rules of origin applicable to
textile and apparel goods within five years after the date of
entry into force of this Agreement to take into account the
effect of increasing global competition on textile and apparel
goods, and the implications of any integration into the GATT of
textile and apparel goods pursuant to any successor agreement to
the Multifiber Arrangement.  The Parties shall give particular
consideration to operative rules in other economic association or
integration agreements and developments related to textile and
apparel production and trade between the Parties and worldwide.


Section 8:  Labelling Requirements

     To facilitate trade in textile and apparel goods between the
Parties through the harmonization of domestic labelling
requirements and the elimination of unnecessary obstacles to
trade resulting from differences in such requirements, the
Subcommittee on Labelling of Textile and Apparel Goods
established under Article 913(5) shall perform the functions set
out in Annex 913-D.


Section 9:  Trade in Worn Clothing and Other Worn Articles

1.   The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Trade in Worn
Clothing comprising representatives of each Party. The purpose of
the Committee shall be to assess the potential effects that may
result from the elimination of restrictions, maintained by a
Party prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement, on
trade in worn clothing and other worn articles as defined in the
heading 63.09 of the HS.  This Committee shall:

     (a) include or consult with a broadly representative group
 from the manufacturing and retailing sectors in each
 Party; and

     (b) act in a transparent manner and reach recommendations
 by consensus of all representatives involved.

2.   The Committee shall develop and pursue a work program to
consider the potential benefits and risks that may be derived
from the elimination of restrictions on trade between the Parties
in worn clothing and other worn articles, including the effects
on business and employment opportunities, and on the market for
textile and apparel goods in each Party.

3.   Notwithstanding Article 309 and paragraph 2 of Section 3, a
Party may maintain restrictions in effect upon the date of entry
into force of this Agreement on the importation of worn clothing
and other worn articles classified under heading 63.09 of the HS,
unless the Parties agree otherwise on the basis of the
recommendations presented to the Commission by the Committee on
Trade in Worn Clothing.

			       APPENDIX 3.1

	     Administering Import and Export Restrictions and
			    Consultation Levels


General Provisions Applicable Only to Trade Between Mexico and
the United States and Between Mexico and Canada

1.   A Party applying a restriction or consultation level on non-
originating goods pursuant to Section 5 or paragraph 8 of this
Appendix shall apply it in accordance with this Appendix and its
Schedules.

2.   An exporting Party whose textile or apparel good is subject
to a restriction or consultation level shall limit its annual
exports to the specified limits or levels, and the importing
Party may assist the exporting Party in implementing such
restriction or consultation level by controlling its imports.

3.   Textile and apparel goods exported subject to restrictions
or consultation levels shall be counted against the limits or
levels applicable to the year in which exported.  Exports in
excess of authorized limits or levels in each calendar year
shall, if allowed entry into the importing Party, be charged to
the limit or level authorized for the succeeding year.

4.   Each exporting Party whose goods are subject to a
restriction or consultation level shall use its best efforts to
space exports of such goods to the territory of the importing
Party evenly throughout each calendar year, taking into
consideration normal seasonal factors.

5.   Upon written request by an exporting Party whose goods are
subject to a restriction or consultation level, that Party and
the importing Party shall enter into consultations, within 30
days of receipt of the written request therefor, on any question
arising from the implementation of this Appendix.  If the
exporting Party considers that, as a result of a restriction or
consultation level applied under this Appendix, it is being
placed in an inequitable position in relation to another Party or
a non-Party, the consulting Parties shall seek a mutually
beneficial solution within 60 days of the request for
consultations.

6.   The Parties concerned may by mutual agreement adjust annual
Designated Consultation Levels (DCLs) as follows:

     (a) if an exporting Party whose goods are subject to a DCL
 wishes to export goods in any category in excess of the
 applicable DCL in any calendar year, that Party may
 present to the importing Party a formal written request
 for an increase in the DCL; and

     (b) the importing Party shall respond, in writing, within
 30 days of the receipt of the request.  If the response
 to a request is negative, consultations shall take
 place not later than 15 days after the receipt of the
 negative response or as soon as mutually convenient.
 The Parties concerned shall endeavor to reach a
 mutually satisfactory solution.  An exchange of letters
 shall confirm any agreement reached on any new DCL.

7.  The Parties may adjust annual Specific Limits (SLs) as
follows:

     (a) an exporting Party wishing to adjust an SL in
 accordance with this paragraph shall provide notice to
 the importing Party of its intent to make such
 adjustment;

     (b) that exporting Party may increase any SL by not more
 than 6 percent (swing); and

     (c) in addition, exports from that Party may exceed by a
 maximum of 11 percent any SL by allocating to such
 limit for that calendar year an unused portion
 ("shortfall") of the corresponding limit for the
 previous calendar year ("carryover") or a portion of
 the corresponding limit for the succeeding calendar
 year ("carryforward") subject to the following
 conditions

     (i) carryover may be utilized as available up to 11
 percent of the receiving calendar year's
 applicable limits,

	  (ii) carryforward may be utilized up to 6 percent of
 the receiving calendar year's applicable limits
 and shall be charged against the  succeeding
 calendar year's corresponding limits,

	  (iii) the combination of carryover and carryforward
 shall not exceed 11 percent of the receiving
 calendar year's applicable limits in any
 calendar year, and

	  (iv) carryover of shortfall shall be applied to any
 specific limit following notice given by the
 exporting Party and confirmation by the importing
 Party that sufficient shortfall exists.  If the
 importing Party does not consider that sufficient
 shortfall exists, it will promptly provide data to
 support that view.  If substantial statistical
 differences exist between the import and export
 data upon which shortfall for a given period is
 computed, the Parties shall work to resolve these
 differences promptly.

Provisions Applicable Only to Trade between Mexico and the United
States

8.   During the transition period, non-originating textile and
apparel goods of Mexico exported to the United States shall be
subject to the restrictions and consultation levels specified in
Schedule 3.1.2, in accordance with this Appendix and its
Schedules.  Such restrictions and consultation levels shall be
progressively eliminated as follows:

     (a) restrictions or consultation levels on items contained
 in the categories of textile and apparel goods in
 staging category 1 in Schedule 3.1.1 shall be
 eliminated on January 1, 1994;

     (b) restrictions or consultation levels on items contained
 in the categories of textile and apparel goods in
 staging category 2 in Schedule 3.1.1 shall be
 eliminated on January 1, 2001; and

     (c) restrictions or consultation levels on items contained
 in the categories of textile and apparel goods in
 staging category 3 in Schedule 3.1.1 shall be
 eliminated on January 1, 2004.

9.   In addition, on January 1, 1994, the United States shall
eliminate restrictions or consultation levels on textile and
apparel goods that are:

     (a) assembled in Mexico from fabrics wholly formed and cut
 in the United States; and

     (b) exported from and reimported into the United States
 under U.S. tariff item 9802.00.80.10,

and, notwithstanding Section 5, shall not adopt or maintain
prohibitions, restrictions, or consultation levels on textile and
apparel goods of Mexico that satisfy the requirements of any
successor provision to that U.S. tariff item.

10.    Notwithstanding paragraph 8, no Party may apply the
restrictions and consultation levels specified in Schedule 3.1.2
to the following textile and apparel goods, provided such goods
have been certified by the competent authority of Mexico as one
of the following:

     (a) hand-loomed fabrics of a cottage industry;

     (b) hand-made cottage industry goods made of such hand-
 loomed fabrics; or

     (c) traditional folklore handicraft goods

that have been identified and agreed between the United States
and Mexico for exemption from quantitative restrictions.

11.  The Bilateral Textile Agreement Between the United States of
America and the United Mexican States, signed at Mazatlan
February 13, 1988, as amended and extended (the Bilateral
Agreement), shall terminate upon the date of entry into force of
this Agreement.

12.  Except as otherwise provided in this Annex, the Parties
shall eliminate the restrictions and consultation levels listed
in Schedule 3.1.2 in accordance with the schedule provided in
Schedule 3.1.1.  At the request of either Party, the Parties
shall consult to consider accelerating the elimination of
restrictions or consultation levels on specific textile and
apparel goods.	An agreement between the Parties to accelerate
the elimination of a restriction or consultation level shall be
considered part of this Agreement, superseding Schedule 3.1.1.

13.  During the first calendar year following the date of entry
into force of this Agreement, Mexico may carry over any unused
portion of the preceding year's limit specified in the Bilateral
Agreement, or apply against the first year's limit specified in
this Appendix any exports made during the preceding year in
excess of the applicable limit under the Bilateral Agreement, in
accordance with the flexibility provisions set forth in paragraph
7.

14.  All exports of textiles and apparel goods from the territory
of Mexico to the territory of the United States covered by
restrictions or consultation levels under this Appendix shall be
accompanied by an export visa issued by the competent authority
of Mexico, pursuant to a bilateral visa arrangement, as amended.

15.  At the written request of either Party, both Parties shall
consult, within 30 days of receipt of the request, on any
questions arising from the implementation of this Appendix.  In
addition, at the request of either Party, those Parties shall
conduct a major review of this Section no later than five years
from the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

16.  For the purpose of applying restrictions or consultation
levels, each Party shall classify a good as being:

     (a) of man-made fibers if the good is in chief weight of
 man-made fibers, unless

     (i) the good is knitted or crocheted apparel in which
 wool equals or exceeds 23 percent by weight of all
 fibers, in which case it shall be of wool,

     (ii) the good is apparel, not knitted or crocheted, in
 which wool equals or exceeds 36 percent by weight
 of all fibers, in which case it shall be of wool,
 or

     (iii) the good is a woven fabric in which wool
 equals or exceeds 36 percent by weight of all
 fibers, in which case it shall be of wool;

     (b) of cotton, if not covered by (a) and if the good is in
 chief weight of cotton, unless the good is a woven
 fabric in which wool equals or exceeds 36 percent by
 weight of all fibers, in which case it shall be of
 wool;

     (c) of wool, if not covered by (a) or (b), and the good is
 in chief weight of wool; and

     (d) of non-cotton vegetable fiber, if not covered by (a),
 (b), or (c), and the good is in chief weight of non-
 cotton vegetable fiber, unless

     (i) cotton with wool and/or man-made fibers in the
 aggregate equal or exceed 50 percent by weight of
 the component fibers thereof and the cotton
 component equals or exceeds the weight of each of
 the total wool and/or man-made fiber components,
 in which case it shall be of cotton,

     (ii) if not covered by (d)(i) and wool exceeds 17
 percent by weight of all component fibers, in
 which case it shall be of wool, or

     (iii) if not covered by (d)(i) or (d)(ii) and man-
 made fibers in combination with cotton and/or
 wool in the aggregate equal or exceed 50
 percent by weight of the component fibers
 thereof and the man-made fiber component
 exceeds the weight of the total wool and/or
 total cotton component, in which case it
 shall be of man-made fibers.

 trade area and that meet other applicable conditions
 for preferred tariff treatment under this Agreement.
 The SME shall be determined in accordance with the
 conversion factors setout in Schedule 3.1.3 of Appendix
 3.1.

     (b) The annual tariff preference level and sub-levels on
 imports from Canada into the United States shall be
 adjusted by an annual growth factor of two percent for
 five consecutive years commencing on January 1, 1995.

5.   For purposes of paragraph 4, the number of square meters
equivalent that will be counted against the tariff preference
levels applied to trade between Canada and the United States
shall be:

     (a) for textile goods that do not originate because certain
 non-originating textile materials do not undergo the
 applicable change in tariff classification described in
 Annex 401.1 for that good, but where such materials are
 50 percent or less by weight of the materials of that
 good, only 50 percent of the square meters equivalent
 for that good, determined in accordance with the
 conversion factors set out in Schedule 3.1.3 of
 Appendix 3.1; and

     (b) for textile goods that do not originate because certain
 non-originating textile materials do not undergo the
 applicable change in tariff classification described in
 Annex 401.1 for that good, but where such materials are
 more than 50 percent by weight of the materials of that
 good, 100 percent of the square meters equivalent for
 that good, determined in accordance with the conversion
 factors set out in Schedule 3.1.3 of Appendix 3.1.


Spun Yarn

6.   (a) Each Party shall apply the rate of duty applicable to
 originating goods as set out in Appendix 2.1, up to the
 annual quantities specified in Schedule 6.0.3, in
 kilograms (kg), to cotton or man-made fiber yarns
 provided for in headings 5205 through 5207 or 5509
 through 5511 that are spun in a Party from fiber of
 headings 5201 through 5203 or 5501 through 5507,
 produced or obtained outside the free trade area and
 that meet other applicable conditions for preferred
 tariff treatment under this Agreement.

     (b) The annual tariff preference level on imports from
 Canada into the United States shall be adjusted by an
 annual growth factor of two percent for five
 consecutive years commencing on January 1, 1995.

7.   Textile or apparel goods that enter a Party under paragraphs
1, 2, 4, and 6 shall not be considered to be originating goods.


Review and Consultations

8.   (a) Trade in the goods described in paragraphs 1, 2, 4, and
 6 shall be monitored by the Parties with a view to
 adjusting annual tariff preference levels for imports
 into Canada from Mexico and the United States, imports
 into Mexico from Canada and the United States, and
 imports into the United States from Mexico at the
 request of a Party based on the ability to obtain
 supplies of particular fibers, yarns and fabrics, as
 appropriate, that can be used to produce originating
 goods.  Any adjustment in the tariff preference level
 would require the mutual consent of the affected
 Parties.

     (b) The United States and Canada will decide, in
 consultations as provided for in paragraph 3 of Section
 7, whether to continue to apply annual growth factors
 to the specified tariff preference levels following the
 five consecutive years.  If a growth factor for a
 tariff preference level is not continued as a result of
 the consultations provided for in paragraph 3 of
 Section 7, the provisions of subparagraph (a) shall
 also apply to imports from Canada into the United
 States of goods covered by the tariff preference level.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
