              Correspondence of the Honourable Horace Walpole



1749

13 Letter 1
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, March 4, 1749.

I have been so shut up in the House of Commons for this last
fortnight or three weeks, that I have not had time to write you
a line: we have not had such a session since the famous
beginning of last Parliament.  I am come hither for a day or
two of rest and air, and find the additional pleasure of great
beauty in my improvements: I could talk to you through the
whole sheet, and with much more satisfaction, upon this head;
but I shall postpone my own amusement to yours, for I am sure
you want much more to know what has been doing in Parliament
than at Strawberry Hill.  You will conclude that we have been
fighting over the peace; but we have not.  It is laid before
Parliament, but will not be taken up; the Opposition foresee
that a vote of approbation would pass, and therefore will not
begin upon it, as they wish to reserve it for censure in the
next reign--or perhaps the next reign does not care to censure
now what he must hereafter maintain--and the ministry do not
seem to think their treaty so perfect as not to be liable to
blame, should it come to be canvassed.  We have been then upon
several other matters: but first I should tell you, that from
the utmost tranquillity and impotence of a minority, there is
at once started up so formidable an Opposition as to divide 137
against 203.(1)  The minority is headed by the Prince, who has
continued opposing, though very unsuccessfully, ever since the
removal of Lord Granville, and the desertion of the patriots.
He stayed till the Pelhams had brought off every man of parts
in his train, and then began to form his party.  Lord Granville
has never come into it., for fear of breaking with the King; and
seems now to be patching up again with his old enemies.  If Lord
Bath has dealt with the Prince, it has been underhand.  His
ministry has had at the head of it poor Lord Baltimore, a very
good-natured, weak, honest man; and Dr. Lee, a civilian, who was
of Lord Granville's admiralty, and is still much attached to him.
He is a grave man, and a good speaker, but of no very bright
parts, and, from his way of life and profession, much ignorant
of, and unfit for, a ministry.  You will wonder what new
resources the Prince has discovered-why, he has found them all
in Lord Egmont, whom you have heard of under the name of Lord
Perceval; but his father, an Irish Earl, is lately dead.  As he
is likely to make a very considerable figure in our history, I
shall give you a more particular account of him.  He has always
earnestly studied our history and constitution and antiquities,
with very ambitious views; and practised speaking early in the
Irish Parliament.  Indeed, this turn is his whole fund, for
though he is between thirty and forty, he knows nothing of the
world, and is always unpleasantly dragging the conversation to
political dissertations.  When very young, as he has told me
himself, he dabbled in writing Craftsmen and penny-papers; but
the first event that made him known, was his carrying the
Westminster election at the end of my father's ministry,-which
he amply described in the history of his own family, a
genealogical work called "The History of the House of
Yvery,"(2) a work which cost him three thousand pounds, as the
heralds informed Mr. Chute and me, when we went to their office
on your business; and which was so ridiculous, that he has
since tried to suppress all the copies.  It concluded with the
description of the Westminster election, in these or some such
words, "And here let us leave this young nobleman struggling
for the dying liberties of his country!"  When the change in
the ministry happened, and Lord Bath was so abused by the
remnant of the patriots, Lord Egmont published his celebrated
pamphlet, called "Faction Detected," a work which the Pitts and
Lytteltons have never forgiven him; and which, though he
continued voting and sometimes speaking with the Pelhams, made
him quite unpopular during all the last Parliament.  When the
new elections approached, he stood on his own bottom at Weobly
in Herefordshire; but his election being contested, be applied
for Mr. Pelham's support, who carried it for him in the House
of Commons.  This will always be a material blot in his life;
for he had no sooner secured his seat, than he openly attached
himself to the Prince, and has since been made a lord of his
bedchamber.  At the opening of this session, he published an
extreme good pamphlet, which has made infinite noise, called
"An Examination of the Principles and Conduct of the two
Brothers," (the Pelhams,) and as Dr. Lee has been laid up with
the gout, Egmont has taken the lead in the Opposition, and has
made as great a figure as perhaps was ever made in so short a
time.  He is very bold and resolved, master of vast knowledge,
and speaks at once with fire and method.  His words are not
picked and chosen like Pitt's, but his language is useful, clear,
and strong.  He has already by his parts and resolution mastered
his great unpopularity, so far as to be heard with the utmost
attention, though I believe nobody had ever more various
difficulties to combat.  All the old corps hate him on my father
and Mr. Pelham's account; the new part of the ministry on their
own.  The Tories have not quite forgiven his having left them in
the last Parliament: besides that, they are now governed by one
Prowse, a cold, plausible fellow. and a great well-wisher to
Mr. Pelham.  Lord Strange,(3) a busy Lord of a party by
himself, yet voting generally with the Tories, continually
clashes with Lord Egmont; and besides all this, there is a
faction in the Prince's family, headed by Nugent, who are for
moderate measures.

Nugent is most affectedly an humble servant of Mr. Pell)afn,
and seems only to have attached himself to the Prince, in order
to make the better bargain with the ministry; he has great
parts, but they never know how to disentangle themselves from
bombast and absurdities.  Besides those, there are two young
men who make some figure in the rising Opposition, Bathurst(4)
attorney to the Prince; and Potter, whom I believe you have had
mentioned in my letters of last year; but he has a bad
constitution, and is seldom able to be in town.  Neither of
these are in the scale of moderation.

The Opposition set out this winter with trying to call for
several negotiations during the war; but the great storm which
has so much employed us of late, was stirred up by Colonel
Lyttelton;(5) who, having been ill-treated by the Duke, has
been dealing with the Prince.  He discovered to the House some
innovations in the Mutiny-bill, of which, though he could not
make much, the Opposition have, and fought the bill for a whole
fortnight; during the course of which the world has got much
light into many very arbitrary proceedings of the
Commander-in-chief,(6) which have been the more believed too by
the defection of my Lord Townshend's(7) eldest son, who is one of
his aide-de-camps.  Though the ministry, by the weight of
numbers, have carried their point in a great measure, yet you may
be sure great heats have been raised; and those have been still
more inflamed by a correspondent practice in a new Navy-bill,
brought in by the direction of Lord Sandwich and Lord Anson,
but vehemently opposed by half the fleet, headed by Sir Peter
Warren, the conqueror of Cape Breton, richer than Anson, and
absurd as Vernon.  The bill has even been petitioned against,
and the mutinous were likely to go great lengths, if' the
admiralty had not bought off some by money, and others by
relaxing in the material points.- We began upon it yesterday,
and are still likely to have a long affair of it-so much for
politics: and as for any thing else, I scarce know any thing
else.  My Lady Huntingdon,(8) the Queen of the Methodists, has
got her daughter named for lady of the bedchamber to the
Princesses; but it is all off again. as she will not let her
play at cards on Sundays.  It is equally absurd on both sides,
to refuse it, or to insist upon it.

Pray tell Dr. Cocchi that I shall be extremely ready to do him
any service in his intended edition of the old Physicians,(9)
but that I fear it is a kind of work that will lie very little
within my sphere to promote.  Learning is confined to very
narrow bounds at present, and those seldom within the circle in
which I necessarily live; but my regard for him and for you
would make me take any pains.  You see, I believe, that I do
take pains for you--I have not writ such a letter to any body
these three years.  Adieu!

P. S. I am very sorry for your sake that the Prince and
Princess(10) are leaving Florence; if ever I return thither, as
I always flatter myself I shall, I should miss them extremely.

16 Letter 2
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 23, 1749.

Our debates on the two military bills, the naval one of which
is not yet finished, have been so tedious, that they have
rather whittled down the Opposition than increased it.  In the
Lords, the Mutiny-bill passed pretty easily, there happening no
quarrel between Lord Bathurst and Lord Bath on the method of
their measures; so there never divided above sixteen in the
minority, and those scarce any of the Prince's Lords.  Duke
William was there and voted, which was too indecent in a rigorous
bill calculated for his own power.  There is a
great disunion among the ministers on the Naval bill: Mr.
Pelham and Pitt (the latter out of hatred and jealousy of Lord
Sandwich) gave up the admiralty in a material point, but the
paramount little Duke of Bedford has sworn that they shall
recant on the report-what a figure they will make! This bill
was chiefly of Anson's projecting, who grows every day into new
unpopularity.(11)  He has lately had a sea-piece drawn of the
victory for which he was lorded, in which his own ship in a
cloud of cannon was boarding the French Admiral.  This
circumstance, which was as true as if Mademoiselle Scudery had
written his life (for he was scarce in sight when the Frenchman
struck to Boscawen)(12) has been so ridiculed by the whole
tar-hood, that the romantic part has been forced to be
cancelled, and one only gun remains firing at Anson's ship.
The two Secretaries of State(13) grow every day nearer to a
breach; the King's going abroad is to decide the contest.
Newcastle, who Hanoverizes more and more every day, pushes on
the journey, as he is to be the attendant minister: his
lamentable brother is the constant sacrifice of all these
embroils.

At the Leicester-house the jars are as great: Doddington, who
has just resigned the treasuryship of the navy, in hopes of
once more governing that court (and there is no court where he
has not once or twice tried the same scheme!) does not succeed:
Sir Francis Dashwood and Lord Talbot are strongly for him-could
one conceive that he could still find a dupe? Mr. Fox had a
mind to succeed him, but both King and Duke have so earnestly
pressed him to remain secretary at war, that he could not
refuse.  The King would not hear of any of the newer court; and
Legge, who of the old was next oars, has managed in the
Prussian business so clumsily, that the King would not bear him
in his closet: but he has got the navy-office, which Lyttelton
would have had, but could not be rechosen at his borough, which
he had stolen by surprise from his old friend and brother Tom
Pitt.  The treasury is to be filled up with that toad-eater and
spy to all parties, Harry Vane:(14) there is no enumerating all
the circumstances that make his nomination scandalous and
ridiculous!-but such is our world! General Charles Howard and a
Mr. Saville are named to the red riband.
 My friend the Duke of Modena is again coming hither, which
astonishes me, considering how little reason he had to be
satisfied with his first visit; and sure he will have less now!
I believe I told you that King Theodore(15) is here: I am to
drink coffee with him to-morrow at Lady Schaub's.  I have
curiosity to see him, though I am not commonly fond of sights,
but content myself with the oil-cloth picture of them that is
hung out, and to which they seldom come up.  There are two
black Princes of Anamaboe here, who are in fashion at all the
assemblies, of whom I scarce know any particulars, though their
story(16) is very like Oroonoko's: all the women know it-and
ten times more than belongs to it.  Apropos to Indian
historians, half our thoughts are taken up--that is, my Lord
Halifax's are--with colonizing in Nova Scotia: my friend
Colonel Cornwallis is going thither commander-in-chief.  The
Methodists will scarce follow him as they did Oglethorpe; since
the period of his expedition,(17) their lot is fallen in a
better land.  Methodism is more fashionable than any thing but
brag; the women play very deep at both--as deep, it is much
suspected, as the matrons of Rome did at the mysteries of the
Bona Dea.  If gracious Anne was alive, she would make an
admirable defendress of the new faith, and build fifty more
churches for female proselytes.

If I had more paper or time, I could tell you an excellent long
history of my brother Ned'S(18) envy, which was always up at
highwater-mark, but since the publication of my book of
Houghton (one should have thought a very harmless performance),
has overflowed on a thousand ridiculous occasions.  Another
great object of his jealousy is my friendship with Mr. Fox: my
brother made him a formal visit at nine o'clock the other
morning, and in a set speech of three quarters of an hour,
begged his pardon for not attending the last day of the Mutiny
bill, which, he said was so particularly brought in by him,
though Mr. Fox assured him that he had no farther hand in it
than from his office.  Another instance: when my brother went
to live at Frogmore, Mr. Fox desired him to employ his
tradesmen at Windsor, by way of supporting his interest in that
borough.  My brother immediately went to the Duke of St. Albans,
to whom he had never spoke, (nor indeed was his acquaintance with
Mr. Fox much greater), and notified to him, that if seven years
hence his grace should have any contest with Mr. Fox about that
borough, he should certainly espouse the latter.  Guess how the
Duke stared at so strange and unnecessary a declaration!

Pigwiggin's Princess has mis-pigged, to the great joy, I
believe, of that family, for you know a child must have eaten.
Adieu!

(11) It was entitled, A bill for amending, explaining, and
reducing into one act, the laws relating to the Navy. "it was,"
says Sir John Barrow, "a most desirable and highly useful
measure.  The principal and , indeed, the only novelties
attempted to be introduced, were, first, that of subjecting
half pay officers to courts-martial, which after much
opposition was thrown out; the second was the administration of
an oath of secrecy to the members, which was carried, and
continues to the present time." See Life of Lord Anson, p.
218.--E.

(16) Their story is briefly this: A Moorish king, who had
entertained with great hospitality a British captain
trafficking on the coast of Africa, reposed such confidence in
him, as to intrust him with his son, about eighteen years of
age, and another sprightly youth, to be brought to England and
educated in the European manners.  The captain received them,
and basely sold them for slaves.  He shortly after died; and,
the ship coming to England, the officers related the whole
affair: upon which the government sent to pay their ransom, and
they were brought to England and put under the care of the Earl
of Halifax, then at the head of the board of trade, who had
them clothed and educated in a suitable manner.  They were
afterwards received in the higher circles, and introduced to
the King.  On the first of February in this year, they appeared
at the Covent-Garden theatre, to see the tragedy of Oroonok;
where they were received with a loud clap of applause, which
they returned with a genteel bow.  The tender interview between
Imoinda and Oroonoko so affected the Prince, that he was
obliged to retire at the end of the fourth act.  His companion
remained, but wept all the time so bitterly that it affected
the audience more than the play.-E.

Georgia.  See vol. i.-E.

19 Letter 3
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, May 3, 1749.

I am come hither for a few days, to repose myself after a
torrent of diversions, and am writing to you in my charming
bow-window with a tranquillity and satisfaction which, I fear,
I am grown old enough to prefer to the hurry of amusements, in
which the whole world has lived for this last week.  We have at
last celebrated the peace, and that as much in extremes as we
generally do everything, whether we have reason to be glad or
sorry, pleased or angry.  Last Tuesday it was proclaimed: the
King did not go to St. Paul's, but at night the whole town was
illuminated.  The next day was what was called "a
jubilee-masquerade in the Venetian manner" at Ranelagh: it had
nothing Venetian in it, but was by far the best understood and
the prettiest spectacle I ever saw: nothing in a fairy tale
ever surpassed it. One of the proprietors, who is a German, and
belongs to court, had got my Lady Yarmouth to persuade the King
to order it.  It began at three o'clock, and, about five,
people of fashion began to go.  When you entered, you found the
whole garden filled with masks and spread with tents, which
remained all night very commodely.  In one quarter was a
May-pole dressed with garlands, and people dancing round it to
a tabor and pipe and rustic music, all masqued,'as were all the
various bands of music that were disposed in different parts of
the garden; some like huntsmen with French-horns, some like
peasants, with a troop of harlequins and scaramouches in the
little open temple on the mount.  On the canal was a sort of
gondola, adorned with flags and streamers, and filled with
music, rowing about.  All round the outside of the amphitheatre
were shops, filled with Dresden china, Japan, etc. and all the
shop-keepers in mask.  The amphitheatre was illuminated; and in
the middle was a circular bower, composed of all kinds of firs
in tubs from twenty to thirty feet high: under them
orange-trees, with small lamps in each orange, and below them
all sorts of the finest auriculas in pots; and festoons of
natural flowers hanging from tree to tree.  Between the arches
too were firs, and smaller ones in the balconies above.  There
were booths for tea and wine, gaming-tables and dancing, and
about two thousand persons.  In short, it pleased me more than
any thing I ever saw.  It is to be once more, and probably
finer as to dresses, as there has since been a
subscription-masquerade, and people will go in their rich habits.
The next day were the fire-works, which by no means answered the
expense, the length of preparation, and the expectation that
had been raised; indeed, for a week before, the town was like a
country fair, the streets filled from morning to night,
scaffolds building wherever you could or could not see, and
coaches arriving from every corner of the kingdom.  This hurry
and lively scene, with the sight of the immense crowd in the
Park and on every house, the guards, and the machine itself,
which was very beautiful, was all that was worth seeing.  The
rockets, and whatever was thrown up into the air, succeeded
mighty well; but the wheels, and all that was to compose the
principal part, were pitiful and ill-conducted, with no changes
of coloured fires and shapes: the illumination was mean, and
lighted so slowly that scarce any body had patience to wait the
finishing; and then, -what contributed to the awkwardness of
the whole, was the right pavilion catching fire, and being
burnt down in the middle of the show.  The King, the Duke, and
Princess Emily saw it from the library,(19) with their courts:
the Prince and Princess, with their children, from Lady
Middlesex's; no place being provided for them, nor any
invitation given to the library.  The lords and Commons had
galleries built for them and the chief citizens along the rails
of the mall: the lords had four tickets a-piece, and each
Commoner, at first, but two, till the Speaker bounced and
obtained a third.  Very little mischief was done, and but two
persons killed: at Paris, there were forty killed and near
three hundred wounded, by a dispute between the French and
Italians in the management, who, quarrelling for precedence in
lighting the fires, both lighted at once and blew up the whole.
Our mob was extremely tranquil, and very unlike those I
remember in my father's time, when it was a measure in the
Opposition to work up every thing to mischief, the excise and
the French players, the convention and the gin-act.  We are as
much now in the opposite extreme, and in general so pleased
with the peace, that I could not help being struck with a
passage I read lately in Pasquier an old French author, who
says, "that in the time of Francis 1. the French used to call
their creditors 'Des Anglois,' from the facility with which the
English gave credit to them in all treaties, though they had
broken so many." On Saturday we had a serenata at the
Opera-house, called Peace in Europe, but it was a wretched
performance.  On Monday there was a subscription-masquerade,
much fuller than that of last year, but not so agreeable or so
various in dresses.  The King was well disguised in an
old-fashioned English habit, and much pleased with somebody who
desired him to hold their cup as they were drinking tea.  The
Duke had a dress of the same kind, but was so immensely
corpulent that he looked like Cacofogo, the drunken captain, in
Rule a Wife and Have a Wife.  The Duchess of Richmond was a
lady mayoress in the time of James I.; and Lord Delawarr,(20)
Queen Elizabeth's porter, from a picture in the guard-chamber at
Kensington; they were admirable masks.  Lady Rochford, Miss
Evelyn, Miss Bishop, Lady Stafford,(21) and
Mrs. Pitt,(22) were in vast beauty; particularly the last, who
had a red veil, which made her look gloriously handsome.  I
forgot Lady Kildare.  Mr. Conway was the Duke in Don Quixote,
and the finest figure I ever saw.  Miss Chudleigh(23) was
Iphigenia, but so naked that you would have taken her for
Andromeda; and Lady Betty Smithson had such a pyramid of
baubles upon her head, that she was exactly the Princess of
Babylon in Grammont.

You will conclude that, after all these diversions, people
begin to think of going out of town--no such matter: the
Parliament continues sitting, and will till the middle Of June;
Lord Egmont told us we should sit till Michaelmas.  There are
many private bills, no public ones of any fame.  We were to
have had some chastisement for Oxford, where, besides the late
riots, the famous Dr. King,(24) the Pretender's great agent,
made a most violent speech at the opening of the Ratcliffe
library.  The ministry denounced judgment, but, in their old
style, have grown frightened, and dropped it.  However, this
menace gave occasion to a meeting and union between the
Prince's party and the Jacobites, which Lord Egmont has been
labouring all the winter.  They met at the St. Alban's tavern,
near Pall-mall, last Monday morning, an hundred and twelve
Lords and Commoners.  The Duke of Beaufort(25) opened the
assembly with a panegyric on the stand that had been made this
winter against so corrupt an administration, and hoped it would
continue, and desired harmony.  Lord Egmont seconded this
strongly, and begged they would come up to Parliament early
next winter.  Lord Oxford(26) spoke next; and then Potter, with
great humour, and to the great Abashment of the Jacobites, said
he was very glad to see this union, and from thence hoped, that
if another attack like the last rebellion should be made on the
Royal Family, they would all stand by them.  No reply was made
to this.  Then Sir Watkyn Williams spoke, Sir Francis Dashwood,
and Tom Pitt,(27) and the meeting broke up.  I don't know what
his coalition may produce; it will require time with no better
heads than compose it at present, though great Mr. Doddington
had carried to the conference the assistance of his.  In France a
very favourable event has happened for us, the disgrace of
Maurepas,(28) one of our bitterest enemies, and the promoter of
their marine.  Just at the beginning of the war, in a very
critical period, he had obtained a very large sum for that
service, but which one of the other factions, lest he should gain
glory and credit by it, got to be Suddenly given away to the King
of Prussia.

Sir Charles Williams is appointed envoy to this last King: here
is an epigram which he has just sent over on Lord Egmont's
opposition to the Mutiny-bill;

"Why has lord Egmont 'gainst this bill
So much declamatory skill
So tediously exerted?
The reason's plain: but t'other day
He mutinied himself for pay,
And he has twice descried."

I must tell you a bon-mot that was made the other night at the
serenata of "Peace in Europe" by Wall,(29) who is Much in
fashion, and a kind of Gondomar.  Grossatesta, the Modenese
minister, a very low fellow, with all the jackpuddinghood of an
Italian, asked, "Mais qui est ce qui repres`ente mon maitre>"
Wall replied, "Mais, mon Die, l'abb`e, ne scavez vous pas que
ce n'est pas un op`era boufon!" And here is another bon-mot of
my Lady Townshend: We were talking of the Methodists: somebody
said, "Nay, Madam, is it true that Whitfield has recanted?"
"No, Sir, he has only canted."

If you ever think of returning to England, as I hope it will be
long first, you must prepare yourself with Methodism.  I really
believe that by that time it will be necessary; this sect
increases as fast as almost ever any religious nonsense did.

Lady Fanny Shirley has chosen this way of bestowing the dregs
of her beauty; and Mr. Lyttelton is very near making the same
sacrifice of the dregs of all those various characters that he
has worn.  The Methodists love your big sinners as proper
subjects to work upon--and indeed they have a plentiful
harvest--I think what you call flagrancy was never more in
fashion.  Drinking is at the highest wine-mark; and gaming
joined with it so violent, that at the last Newmarket meeting,
in the rapidity of both, a bank-bill was thrown down, and
nobody immediately claiming it, they agreed to give it to a man
that was standing by.

I must tell you of Stosch's letter, which he had the
impertinence to give you without telling the contents.  It was
to solicit the arrears of his pension, which I beg you will
Tell him I have no manner of interest to procure; and to tell
me of a Galla Placidia, a gold medal lately found.  It is not for
myself, but I wish you would ask him the price for a friend of
mine who would like to buy it.  Adieu! my dear child; I have been
long in arrears to you, but I trust you will take this huge
letter as an acquittal.  You see my villa makes me a good
correspondent; how happy I should be to show it you, if I could,
with no mixture of disagreeable circumstances to you.  I have
made a vast plantation! Lord Leicester told me the other day that
he heard I would not buy some old china, because I was laying out
all my money in trees; "Yes," said I, my Lord, I used to love
blue trees, but Now I like green ones."

23 Letter 4
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 17, 1749.

We have not yet done diverting ourselves: the night before last
the Duke of Richmond gave a firework; a codicil to the peace.
He bought the rockets and wheels that remained in the pavilion
which miscarried, and took the pretence of the Duke of Modena
being here to give a charming entertainment.  The garden(30)
lies with a slope down to the Thames, on which were lighters,
from whence were thrown up, after a concert of water-music, a
great number of rockets.  Then from boats on every side were
discharged water-rockets and fires of that kind; and then the
wheels Which were ranged along the rails of the terrace were
played off; and the whole concluded with the illumination of a
pavilion on the top of the slope, of two pyramids on each side,
and of the whole length of the balustrade to the water.  You
can't conceive a prettier sight; the garden filled with every
body of fashion, the Duke, the Duke of Modena, and the two
black Princes.  The King and Princess Emily were in their barge
under the terrace; the river was covered with boats, and the
shores and adjacent houses with crowds.  The Duke of Modena
played afterwards at brag, and there was a fine supper for him
and the foreigners, of whom there are numbers here; it is grown
as much the fashion to travel hither as to France or Italy.
Last week there was a vast assembly and music at Bedford-house
for this Modenese; and to-day he is set out to receive his
doctor's degree at the two Universities.  His appearance is
rather better than it used to be, for, instead of wearing his
wig down to his nose to hide the humour in his face, he has
taken to paint his forehead white, which, however, with the
large quantity of red that he always wears on the rest of his
face, makes him ridiculous enough.  I cannot say his manner is
more polished; Princess Emily asked him if he did not find the
Duke much fatter than when he was here before? He replied, "En
verit`e il n'est pas si effroiable qu'on m'avoit dit."  She
commended his diamonds; he said, "Les v`otres sont bien
petits."  As I had been graciously received at his court, I
went into his box the first night at the Opera: the first thing
he did was to fall asleep; but as I did not choose to sit waiting
his reveil in the face of the whole theatre, I waked him, and
would discourse him: but here I was very unlucky, for of the only
two persons I could recollect at his court to inquire after, one
has been dead these four years, and the other, he could not
remember any such man.  However, Sabbatini, his secretary of
state, flattered me extremely: told me he found me beaucoup
mieux, and that I was grown very fat-I fear, I fear it was
flattery! Eight years don't improve one,-and for my corpulence,
if I am grown fat, what must I have been in my Modenese days!

I told you we were to have another jubilee masquerade: there
was one by the King's command for Miss Chudleigh, tire maid of
honour, with whom our gracious monarch has a mind to believe
himself in love,--so much in love, that at one of the booths he
gave her a fairing for her watch, which cost him
five-and-thirty guineas,--actually disbursed out of his privy
purse, and not charged on the civil list.  Whatever you may
think of it, this is a more magnificent present than the
cabinet which the late King of Poland sent to the fair Countess
Konismark, replete with all kinds of baubles and ornaments, and
ten thousand ducats in one of the drawers.  I hope some future
Hollinshed or Stowe will acquaint posterity "that
five-and-thirty guineas were an immense sum in those days!"

You are going to see one of our court-beauties in Italy, my
Lady Rochford:(31) they are setting Out on their embassy to
Turin.  She is large, but very handsome, with great delicacy
and address.  All the Royals have been in love with her; but
the Duke was so in all the forms, till she was a little too
much pleased with her conquest of his brother-in-law the Prince
of Hesse.  You will not find much in the correspondence of her
husband: his person is good, and he will figure well enough as
an ambassador; better as a husband where cicisb`es don't expect
to be molested.  The Duke is not likely to be so happy with his
new passion, Mrs. Pitt,(32) who, besides being in love with her
husband, whom you remember (,lady Mary Wortley's George Pitt),
is going to Italy with him, I think you will find her one of
the most glorious beauties you ever saw.  You are to have
another pair of our beauties, the Princess Borghese's, Mr
Greville(33) and his wife, who was the pretty Fanny M'Cartney.

Now I am talking scandal to you, and court-scandal, I must tell
you that Lord Conway's sister, Miss Jenny, is dead suddenly
with eating lemonade at the last subscription masquerade.,(34)
It is not quite unlucky for her: she had outlived the Prince's
love and her own face, and nothing remained but her love and her
person, which was exceedingly bad.

The graver part of the world, who have not been given up to
rockets and masquing, are amused with a book of Lord
Bolinbroke's, just published, but written long ago.  It is
composed of three letters, the first to Lord Cornbury on the
Spirit of Patriotism; and two others to Mr. lyttelton, (but
with neither of their names,) on the Idea of a patriot King,
and the State of Parties on the late King's accession.  Mr.
Lyttelton had sent him word, that he begged nothing might be
inscribed to him that was to reflect on Lord Orford, for that
he was now leagued with all Lord Orford's friends: a message as
abandoned as the book itself: but indeed there is no describing
the impudence with which that set of people unsay what they
have been saying all their lives,-I beg their pardons, I mean
the honesty with which they recant! Pitt told me coolly, that
he had read this book formerly, when he admired Lord Bolinbroke
more than he does now.  The book by no means answered my
expectation: the style, which is his fort, is very fine: the
deduction and impossibility of drawing a consequence from what
he is saying, as bad and obscure as in his famous Dissertation
on Parties: Von must know the man, to guess his meaning.  Not
to mention the absurdity and impracticability of this kind of
system, there is a long speculative dissertation on the origin
of government, and even that greatly stolen from other writers,
and that all on a sudden dropped, while he hurries into his own
times, and then preaches (he of all men!) on the duty of
preserving decency!  The last treatise would not impose upon an
historian of five years old: he tells Mr. Lyttelton, that he
may take it from him, that there was no settled scheme at the
end of the Queen's reign to introduce the Pretender; and he
gives this excellent reason: because, if there had been, he
must have known it; and another reason as ridiculous, that no
traces of such a scheme have since come to light.  What, no
traces in all cases of himself, Atterbury, the Duke of Ormond,
Sir William Windham, and others! and is it not known that the
moment the queen was expired, Atterbury proposed to go in his
lawn sleeves and proclaim the Pretender at Charing-cross, but
Bolinbroke's heart failing him, Atterbury swore, "There was the
best cause in Europe lost for want of spirit!"  He imputes
Jacobitism singly to Lord Oxford, whom he exceedingly abuses;
and who, so far from being suspected, was thought to have
fallen into disgrace with that faction for refusing to concur
with them.  On my father he is much less severe than I
expected; and in general, so obliquely, that hereafter he will
not be perceived to aim at him, though at this time one knows
so much what was at his heart, that it directs one to his
meaning.

But there is a preface to this famous book, which makes much
more noise than the work itself.  It seems, Lord Bolinbroke had
originally trusted Pope with the copy, to have half-a-dozen
printed for particular friends.  Pope, who loved money
infinitely beyond any friend, got fifteen hundred Copies(35)
printed privately, intending to outlive Bolingbroke and make
great advantage of them; and not only did this, but altered the
copy at his Pleasure, and even made different alterations in
different copies.  Where Lord Bolingbroke had strongly flattered
their common friend lyttelton, Pope suppressed the panegyric:
where, in compliment to Pope, he had softened the satire on
Pope's great friend, Lord Oxford, Pope reinstated the abuse.  The
first part of this transaction is recorded in the preface; the
two latter facts are reported by Lord Chesterfield and Lyttelton,
the latter of whom went to Bolingbroke to ask how he had
forfeited his good opinion.  In short, it is comfortable to us
people of moderate virtue to hear these demigods, and patriots,
and philosophers, inform the world of each other's villanies.(36)
What seems to make Lord Bolinbroke most angry, and I suppose
does, is Pope's having presumed to correct his work.  As to his
printing so many copies, it certainly was a compliment, and the
more profit (which however could not be immense) he expected to
make, the greater opinion he must have conceived of the merit of
the work: if one had a mind to defend Pope, should not one
ask,(37) if any body ever blamed Virgil's executors for not
burning the AEneid, as he ordered them? Warburton, I fear, does
design to defend Pope: and my uncle Horace to answer the book;
his style, which is the worst in the world, must be curious, in
opposition to the other.  But here comes full as bad a part of
the story as any: Lord Bolinbroke, to buy himself out of the
abuse in the Duke of Marlborough's life, or to buy himself into
the supervisal of it, gave those letters to Mallet, who is
writing this life for a legacy in the old Duchess's will, (and
which, with much humour, she gave, desiring it might not be
written in verse,) and Mallet sold them to the bookseller for a
hundred and fifty pounds.  Mallet had many obligations to Pope,
no disobligations to him, and was one of his grossest flatterers;
witness the sonnet on his supposed death, printed in the notes
to the Dunciad.  I was this morning told an anecdote from the
Dorset family that is no bad collateral evidence of the
Jacobitism Of the Queen'S four last years.  They wanted to get
Dover Castle into their hands, and sent down Prior to the present
Duke of Dorset, who loved him, and probably was his brother,(38)
to persuade him to give it up.  He sent Prior back with great
an(-,er, and in three weeks was turned out of the government
himself but it is idle to produce proofs; as idle as to deny the
scheme.

I have just been with your brother Gal. who has been laid up
these two days with the gout in his ankle; an absolute
professed gout in all the forms, and with much pain.  Mr. Chute
is out of town; when he returns, I shall set him upon your
brother to reduce him to abstinence and health.  Adieu!

(34) This event was commemorated in the following doggrel
lines:--

"Poor Jenny Conway

So now she's dead and gone away."-D.

(35) Lord Bolingbroke discovered what Pope had done during his
lifetime, and never forgave him for it.  He-obliged him to give
up the copies, and they were burned on the terrace of Lord
Bolingbroke's house at Battersea, in the presence of Lord B.
and Pope.-D.

(36) In reference to this publication, Lord Bolingbroke
himself, in a letter to Lord Marchmont, written on the 7th of
June, says, "The book you mention has brought no trouble upon
me, though it has given occasion to many libels upon me.  They
are of the lowest form, and seem to be held in the contempt
they deserve.  There I shall leave them, nor suffer a nest of
hornets to disturb the quiet of my retreat.  If these letters
of mine come to your hands, your lordship will find that I have
left out all that was said of our friend Lord Lyttelton in one
of them.  He desired that it might be so; and I had at once the
double mortification of concealing the good I had said of one
friend, and of revealing the turpitude of another.  I hope you
will never have the same treatment that I have met with;
neither will you.  I am single in my circumstances--a species
apart in the political society; and they, who dare to attack no
one else, may attack me.  Chesterfield says, I have made a
coalition of Wig, Tory, Trimmer, and Jacobite against myself.
Be it so.  I have Truth, that is stronger than all of them, on
my side; and, in her company, and avowed by her, I have more
satisfaction than their applause and their favour could give
me." Marchmont Papers.-E.

(37) This thought was borrowed by Mr. Spence, in a pamphlet
published on this occasion in defence of Pope.

(38) Burnet relates that the Earl of Dorset, celebrated for
patronage of Genius, found Prior by chance reading Horace, and
was so well pleased with his proficiency, that he undertook the
care and cost of academical education.



27 Letter 5
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 18, 1749,.

Dear George,
Whatever you hear of the Richmond fireworks, that is short of
the prettiest entertainment in the world, don't believe it - I
really never passed a more agreeable evening.  Every thing
succeeded; all the wheels played in time; Frederick was
fortunate, and all the world in good humour.  Then for
royalty--Mr. Anstis himself would have been glutted; there were
all the Fitzes upon earth, the whole court of St. Germains, the
Duke,(39) the Duke of Modena, and two Anamaboes.  The King, and
Princess Emily bestowed themselves upon the mob on the river
and as soon as they were gone, the Duke had the music into the
garden, and himself, with my Lady Lincoln, Mrs. Pitt, Peggy
Banks, and Lord Holderness, entertained the good subjects with
singing God save the King to them over the rails of the
terrace.  The Duke of Modena supped there, and the Duke was
asked, but he answered, it was impossible; in short, he could
not adjust his dignity to a mortal banquet.  There was an
admirable scene: Lady Burlington brought the Violette, and the
Richmonds had asked Garrick who stood ogling and sighing the
whole time, while my Lady kept a most fierce look-out.
Sabbatini, one of the Duke of Modena's court, was asking me who
all the people were? and who is that? "C'est miladi Hartington,
la belle fille du Duc de Devonshire." "Et qui est cette autre
dame!" It was a distressing question; after a little
hesitation, I replied, "Mais c'est Mademoiselle Violette?" "Et
comment Mademoiselle Violette! j'ai connu une Mademoiselle
Violette, par exemple."(40)  I begged him to look at Miss
Bishop.

In the middle of all these principalities and powers was the
Duchess of Queensbury, in her forlorn trim, a white apron and a
white hood, and would make the Duke swallow all her undress.
T'other day she drove post to Lady Sophia Thomas, at
Parsons-green, and told her that she was come to tell her
something of importance. " What is it!"  "Why take a couple of
beef-steaks, clap them together as if they were for a dumpling,
and eat them with pepper and salt; it is the best thing you
ever tasted: I could not help coming to tell you this:" and
away she drove back to town.  Don't a course of folly for forty
years make one very sick?

The weather is SO hot, and the roads so dusty, that I can't get
to Strawberry; but I shall begin negotiating with you now about
your coming.  You must not expect to find it in beauty.  I hope
to get my bill finished in ten days; I have scrambled it
through the lords; but altogether, with the many difficulties
and plagues, I am a good deal out of humour; my purchases
hitch, and new proprietors start out of the ground, like the
crop of soldiers in the Metamorphosis.  I expect but an
unpleasant summer; my indolence and inattention are not made to
wade through leases and deeds.  Mrs. Chenevix brought me one
yesterday to sign, and her sister Bertrand, the toy-woman of
Bath, for a witness.  I showed them my cabinet of enamels
instead of treating them with white wine.  The Bertrand said,
"Sir, I hope you don't trust all sorts of ladies with this
cabinet!"  What an entertaining assumption of dignity!  I must
tell you an anecdote that I found t'other day in an old French
author, which is a great drawback on beaux sentiments and
romantic ideas.  Pasquier, in his "Recherches de la France," is
giving an account of the Queen of Scots' execution; he says,
the night before, knowing her body must be stripped for her
shroud, she would have her feet washed, because she used
ointment to one of them which was sore.  I believe I have told
you, that in a very old trial of her, which I bought from Lord
Oxford's collection, it is said that she was a large lame
woman.  Take sentiments out of their pantoufles, and reduce
them to the infirmities of mortality, what a falling off there
is! I could not help laughing in myself t'other day, as I went
through Holborn in a very hot day, at the dignity of human
nature; all those foul old-clothes women panting without
handkerchiefs, and mopping themselves all the way down within
their loose jumps.  Rigby gave me a strong picture of human
nature; he and Peter Bathurst t'other night carried a servant
of the latter's, who had attempted to shoot him, before
Fielding; who, to all his other vocations, has, by the grace of
Mr. Lyttelton, added that of Middlesex justice.  He sent them
word he was at supper, that they must come next morning.  They
did not understand that freedom, and ran up, where they found
him banqueting with a blind man,(41) a whore, and three on some
cold mutton and a bone of ham, both in One dish, and the
dirtiest cloth.  He never stirred nor asked them to sit.
Rigby, who had seen him so often come to beg a guinea of Sir C.
Williams, and Bathurst, at whose father's he had lived for
victual,,, understood that dignity as little, and pulled
themselves chairs; on which he civilized.(42)

Millar the bookseller has done generously by him: finding Tom
Jones, for which he had given him six hundred pounds, sell So
greatly, he has since given him another hundred.(43)  Now I
talk to you of authors, Lord Cobham's West(44) has published
his translation of Pindar; the poetry is very stiff, but
prefixed to it there is a very entertaining account of the
Olympic games, and that preceded by an affected inscription to
Pitt and Lyttelton.  The latter has declared his future match
with Miss Rich.  George Grenville has been married these two
days to Miss Windham.  Your friend Lord North is, I suppose you
know, on the brink with the countess of Rockingham;(45) and I
think your cousin Rice is much inclined to double the family
alliance with her sister Furnese.  It went on very currently
for two or three days, but last night at Vauxhall his
minionette face seemed to be sent to languish with Lord R.
Berties's.

Was not you sorry for poor Cucumber?  I do assure you I was; it
was shocking to be hurried away so suddenly, and in so much
torment.  You have heard I suppose of Lord Harry Beauclerc's
resignation, on his not being able to obtain a respite till
November, though the lowest officer in his regiment has got
much longer leave.  It is incredible how Nolkejumskoi has
persecuted this poor man for these four years, since he could
not be persuaded to alter his vote at a court-martial for the
acquittal of a man whom the Duke would have condemned.  Lord
Ossulston, too, has resigned his commission.

I must tell you a good story of Charles Townshend: you know his
political propensity and importance; his brother George was at
supper at the King's Arms with some more young men.  The
conversation somehow or other rambled into politics, and it was
started that the national debt was a benefit. "I am sure it is
not," said Mr. Townshend; I can't tell why, but my brother
Charles can, and I will send to him for arguments."  Charles
was at supper at another tavern, but so much the dupe of this
message, that he literally called for ink and paper, wrote four
long sides of arguments, and sent word that when his company
broke up, he would come and give them more, which he did at one
o'clock in the morning.  I don't think you will laugh much less
at what happened to me: I wanted a print out of a booth, which
I did not care to buy at Osborn's shop: the next day he sent me
the print, and begged that when I had any thing to publish, I
would employ him.

I will now tell you, and finish this long letter, how I shocked
Mr. Mackenzie inadvertently at Vauxhall: we had supped there a
great party, and coming out, Mrs. More, who waits at the gate,
said, "Gentlemen and ladies, you will walk in and hear the
surprising alteration of voice?" I forgetting Mackenzie's
connexions, and that he was formerly of the band, replied, "No,
I have seen patriots enough."

I intend this letter shall last you till you come to Strawberry
Hill.  one might have rolled it out into half-a-dozen.  My best
compliments to your sisters.

(39) The Duke of Cumberland.

(40) Garrick's; marriage with Mademoiselle Eva Maria Violette
took place four days after the date of this letter.-E.

(41) Sir Walter Scott suggests, that this blind man was
probably Fielding's brother.-E.

(42) "Allen, the friend of Pope," says Sir Walter Scott, "was
also one of his benefactors, but unnamed at his own desire;
thus confirming the truth of the poet's beautiful couplet,

'Let humble Allen, with an awkward shame,
Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame.'

It is said that this munificent and modest patron made Fielding
a present of two hundred pounds at one time, and that even
before he was personally acquainted with him."-E.

(43) "This," observes Sir Walter Scott, in his biographical
notice of Fielding, " is a humiliating anecdote, even after we
have made allowance for the aristocratic exaggeration of
Walpole; yet it is consoling to observe that Fielding's
principles remained unshaken, though the circumstances
attending his official situation tended to increase the
careless disrespectability of his private habits.  His own
account of his conduct respecting the dues of the office on
which he depended for subsistence, has never been denied or
doubted: 'I confess,' says he, 'that my private affairs at the
beginning of the winter had but a gloomy aspect; for I had not
plundered the public or the poor of those sums which they who
are always ready to plunder both as much as they can, have been
pleased to suspect me of taking: on the contrary, by composing,
instead of inflaming, the quarrels of porters and beggars, and
by refusing to take a shilling from a man who most undoubtedly
would not have had another left, I had reduced an income of
about five hundred a year, of the dirtiest money upon earth, to
a little more than three hundred; a considerable portion of
which remained with my clerk."'-E.

(44) West's mother was sister to Sir Richard Temple, afterwards
Lord Cobham.  Of his translation of Pindar, Dr. Johnson states,
that he found his expectations surpassed, both by its elegance
and its exactness.  For his "Observations on the Resurrection,"
the University of Oxford, in March 1748, created him a Doctor
of Laws by diploma.  At his residence at Wickham, where he was
often visited by Lyttelton and Pitt, there is a walk designed
by the latter; while the former received at this place that
conviction which produced his "Dissertation on St. Paul."-E.

(45) Daughter of Sir Robert Furnese, and widow of Lewis, Earl
of Rockingham.



30 Letter 6
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, June 4, 1749.

As summery as June and Strawberry Hill may sound, I assure you
I am writing to you by the fire-side: English weather will give
vent to its temper, and whenever it is out of humour it will
blow east and north and all kinds of cold.  Your brothers Ned
and Gal. dined with me to-day, and I carried the latter back to
Richmond: as I passed over the green, I saw Lord Bath, Lord
Lonsdale,(46) and half-a-dozen more of the White's club
sauntering at the door of a house which they have taken there,
and come to every Saturday and Sunday to play at whist.  You
will naturally ask why they can't play at whist in London on
those two days as well as on the other five; indeed I can't
tell you, except that it is so established a fashion to go out
of town at the end of the week, that people do go, though it be
only into another town.  It made me smile to see Lord Bath
sitting there, like a citizen that has left off trade.

Your brother Ned has not seen Strawberry Hill since my great
improvements; he was astonished: it is pretty: you never saw so
tranquil a scene, without the least air of melancholy: I should
hate it, if it was dashed with that.  I forgot to ask Gal. what
is become of the books of Houghton which I gave him six months
ago for you and Dr. Cocchi.  You perceive I have got your
letter of May 23rd, and with it Prince Craon's simple epistle
to his daughter:(47) I have no mind to deliver it: it would be
a proper recommendation of a staring boy on his travels, and is
consequently very suitable to my colleague, Master St. Leger;
but one hates to be coupled with a romping grayhound puppy,
"qui est moins prudent que Monsieur Valpol!" I did not want to
be introduced to Madame de Mirepoix's assemblies, but to be
acquainted with her, as I like her family: I concluded, simple
as he is, that an old Frenchman knew how to make these
distinctions.  By thrusting St. Leger into the letter with me,
and talking of my prudence, I shall not wonder if she takes me
for his bear-leader, his travelling governor!

Mr. Chute, who went from hence this morning, and is always
thinking of blazoning your pedigree(48) in the noblest colours,
has turned over all my library, till he has tapped a new and
very great family for you: in short, by your mother it is very
clear that you are descended from Hubert de Burgh, Grand
Justiciary to Richard the Second: indeed I think he was hanged;
but that is a misfortune that ill attend very illustrious
genealogies; it is as common to them as to the pedigrees about
Paddington and Blacieheath.  I have had at least a dozen
great-great-grandfathers that came to untimely ends.  All your
virtuosos in heraldry are content to know that they had
ancestors who lived five hundred years ago, no matter how they
died.  A match with a low woman corrupts a stream of blood as
long as the Danube, tyranny, villainy, and executions are mere
fleabites, and leave no stain.  The good Lord of Bath, whom I
saw on Richmond-green this evening, did intend, I believe, to
ennoble my genealogy with another execution: how low is he sunk
now from those views! and how entertaining to have lived to see
all those virtuous patriots proclaiming their mutual
iniquities! Your friend Mr. Doddington, it seems, is so reduced
as to be relapsing into virtue.  In my last I told you some
curious anecdotes of another part of the band, of Pope and
Bolingbroke.  The friends of the former have published twenty
pamphlets against the latter; I say against the latter, for, as
there is no defending Pope, they are reduced to satirize
Bolingbroke.  One of them tells him how little he would be
known himself from his own writings, if he were not
immortalized in Pope's; and still more justly, that if be
destroys Pope's moral character, what will become of his own,
which has been retrieved and sanctified by the embalming art of
his friend? However, there are still new discoveries made
every day of Pope's dirty selfishness.  Not content with the
great profits which he proposed to make of the work in
question, he could not bear that the interest of his money
should be lost till Bolingbroke's death; and therefore told him
that it would cost very near as much to have the press set for
half-a-dozen copies as it would for a complete edition, and by
this means made Lord Bolingbroke pay very near the whole
expense of the fifteen hundred.  Another story I have been told
on this occasion, was of a gentleman who, making a visit to
Bishop Atterbury in France, thought to make his court by
commending Pope.  The Bishop replied not: the gentleman doubled
the dose - at last the Bishop shook his head, and said, "Mens
curva in corpore curvo!"  The world will now think justly of
these men: that Pope was the greatest poet, but not the most
disinterested man in the world; and that Bolingbroke had not
all those virtues and not all those talents which the other so
proclaimed; and that be did not even deserve the friendship
which lent him so much merit; and for the mere loan of which he
dissembled attachment to Pope, to whom in his heart he was as
perfidious and as false as he has been to the rest of the
world.

The Duke of Devonshire has at last resigned, for the
unaccountable and unenvied pleasure of shutting himself up at
Chatsworth with his ugly mad Duchess;(49) the more
extraordinary sacrifice, as he turned her head, rather than
give up a favourite match for his son.  She has consented to
live with him there, and has even been with him in town for a
few days, but did not see either her son or Lady Harrington.
On his resignation he asked and obtained an English barony for
Lord Besborough, whose son Lord Duncannon, you know, married
the Duke's eldest daughter.  I believe this is a great
disappointment to my uncle, who hoped he would ask the peerage
for him or Pigwiggin.  The Duke of Marlborough succeeds as lord
steward.  Adieu!

(46)  Henry Lowther, third Viscount Lonsdale, of the first
creation.  He was the second son of John, the first Viscount,
and succeeded his elder brother Richard in the title in 1713.
He was a lord of the bedchamber, and at one period of his life
was privy seal.-D.

(47) Madame de Mirepoix, French ambassadress in England, to
whom her father, Prince Craon, had written a letter of
introduction for Horace Walpole.- D.

(48) Count Richcourt, and some Florentines, his creatures, had

good, and which made it necessary to have his pedigree drawn
out, and sent over to Florence.

(49) Coxe, in his Memoirs of Lord Walpole, vol ii. p. 264, says
that the Duke of Devonshire resigned, because be was disgusted
with the feuds in the cabinet, and perplexed with the jealous
disposition of Newcastle and the desponding spirit of Pelham.
He adds, " that the Duke was a man of sound judgment and
unbiased integrity, and that Sir Robert Walpole used to
declare, that, on a subject which required mature deliberation,
he would prefer his sentiments to those of any other person in
the kingdom."-E.



32 Letter 7
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 25, 1749.

Don't flatter yourself with your approaching year of jubilee;
its pomps and vanities will be nothing to the shows and
triumphs we have had, and are having.  I talk like an
Englishman: here you know we imagine that a jubilee is a season
of pageants, not of devotion but our Sabbath has really been
all tilt and tournament.  There have been, I think, no less
than eight masquerades, the fire-works, and a public act at
Oxford: to-morrow is an installation of six Knights of the Bath,
and in August of as many Garters: Saturday, Sunday,
and Monday next, are the banquets(50) at Cambridge, for the
instalment of the Duke of Newcastle as chancellor.  The whole
world goes to it: he has invited, summoned, pressed the entire
body of nobility and gentry from all parts of England.  His
cooks have been there these ten days, distilling essences of
every living creature, and massacring and confounding all the
species that Noah and Moses took such pains to preserve and
distinguish.  It would be pleasant to see the pedants and
professors searching for etymologies of strange dishes, and
tracing more wonderful transformations than any in the
Metamorphoses.  How miserably Horace's unde et quo Catius will
be hacked about in clumsy quotations! I have seen some that
will be very unwilling performers at the creation of this
ridiculous MaMaMOUChi.(51)  I have set my heart on their giving
a doctor's degree to the Duchess of Newcastle's favourite--this
favourite is at present neither a lover nor an apothecary, but
a common pig, that she brought from Hanover: I am serious; and
Harry Vane, the new lord of the treasury, is entirely employed,
when he is not -,it the Board, in opening and shutting the door
for it.  Tell me, don't you very often throw away my letters in
a passion, and believe that I invent the absurdities I relate!
Were not we as mad when you was in England?

The King, who has never dined out of his own palaces, has just
determined to dine at Claremont to-morrow--all the cooks are at
Cambridge; imagine the distress!

Last Thursday, the Monarch of my last paragraph gave away the
six vacant ribands; one to a Margrave of Anspach, a near
relation of the late Queen; others to the Dukes of leeds(52)
and Bedford, lords Albemarle and Granville: the last, you may
imagine gives some uneasiness.  The Duke of Bedford has always
been unwilling to take one, having tied himself up in the days
of his patriotism to forfeit great sums if ever he did.  The
King told him one day this winter, that he would give none away
but to him and to Anspach.  This distinction struck him: he
could not refuse the honour; but he has endeavoured to waive
it, as one imagines, by a scruple he raised against the oath,
which obliges the knights, whenever they are within two miles
of Windsor, to go and offer.  The King would not abolish the
oath, but has given a general dispensation for all breaches of
it, past, present, and to come.  Lord Lincoln and Lord
Harrington are very unhappy at not being in the list.  The
sixth riband is at last given to Prince George; the ministry
could not prevail for it till within half an hour of the
ceremony; then the Bishop of Salisbury was sent
to notify the gracious intention.  The Prince was at Kew, so
the message was delivered to Prince George(53) himself.  The
child, with great good sense, desired the Bishop to give his
duty and thanks, and to assure the King that he should always
obey him; but that, as his father was out of town, he could
send no other answer.  Was not it clever?  The design of not
giving one riband to the Prince's children had made great
noise; there was a Remembrancer(54) on that subject ready for
the press.  This is the Craftsman of the present age, and is
generally levelled at the Duke,(55) and filled with very
circumstantial cases of his arbitrary behaviour.  It has
absolutely written down Hawly, his favourite general and
executioner, who was to have been upon the staff.

Garrick is married to the famous Violette, first at a
Protestant, and then at a Roman Catholic chapel.  The chapter
of this history is a little obscure and uncertain as to the
consent of the protecting Countess,(56) and whether she gives
her a fortune or not.

Adieu! I believe I tell you strange rhapsodies; but you must
consider that our follies are not only very extraordinary, but
are our business and employment; they enter into our politics,
nay, I think They are our politics(57)--and I don't know which
are the simplest.  they are Tully's description of poetry,
"haec studia juventutem alunt, senectutem oblectant; pernoctant
nobiscum, peregrinantur, rusticantur:" so if you will that I
write to you, you must be content with a detail of absurdities.
I could tell you of Lord Mountford's(58) making
cricket-matches, and fetching up parsons by express from
different parts of England to play matches on Richmond-green;
of his keeping aide-de-camps to ride to all parts to lay bets
for him at horse-races, and of twenty other peculiarities; but
I fancy you are tired: in short, you, who know me, will
comprehend all best when I tell you that I live in such a scene
of folly as makes me even think myself a creature of common
sense.

(50) Gray, in giving an account of the installation to his
friend Wharton, says, "Every one, while it lasted, was very gay
and very busy in the morning, and very owlish and very tipsy at
night.  I make no exceptions, from the Chancellor to Blewcoat.

Garrick a fortune of ten thousand pounds.)

(57) This was frequently the case while the Duke of Newcastle
and Mr.-Pelham were ministers; it was true, that in the case of

three dances and danced but two, Lord Bury and some young men
of fashion began a riot, and would have had her sent from
Burlington-House.  It being feared that she would be hissed on
her next appearance, and Lord Hartington, the cherished of Mr.
Pelham, being son-in-law of Lady Burlington, the ministry were
in great agitation to secure a good reception for the Violette
from the audience, and the Duke was even desired to order Lord
Bury (one of his lords) not to hiss.

35 Letter 8
To George Montagu, Esq.
Mistley, July 5, 1749.

Dear George,
I have this moment received your letter, and it makes me very
unhappy,.  You will think me a brute for not having immediately
told you how glad I should be to see you and your sisters; but
I trust that you will have seen Mrs. Boscawen, by whom I sent
you a message to invite you to Strawberry Hill, when we should
be returned from Roel and Mistley.  I own my message had rather
a cross air; but as you have retrieved all your crimes with me
by your letter, I have nothing to do but to make myself as well
with you as you are with me. Indeed I am extremely unlucky, but
I flatter myself that Messrs. Montagus will not drop their kind
intention, as it is not in my power to receive it now: they
will give me infinite pleasure by a visit.  I stay there till
Monday se'nnight; will that be too late to see you before your
journey to Roel?  You must all promise, at least, to be engaged
to me at my return.  If the least impediment happens
afterwards, I shall conclude my brother has got you from me;
you know jealousy is the mark of my family.

Mr. Rigby makes you a thousand compliments, and wishes you
would ever think his Roel worth your seeing: you cannot imagine
how he has improved it! You have always heard me extravagant in
the praises of the situation. he has demolished all his
paternal intrenchments of walls and square gardens, opened
lawns, swelled out a bow-window, erected a portico, planted
groves, stifled ponds, and flounce himself with flowering
shrubs and Kent fences.  You may imagine that I have a little
hand in all this.  Since I came hither, I have projected a
colonnade to join his mansion to the offices, have been the
death of a tree that intercepted the view of the bridge, for
which, too, I have drawn a white rail, and shall be absolute
travelling Jupiter at Baucis and Philemon's; for I have
persuaded him to transform a cottage into a church, by exalting
a spire upon the end of it, as Talbot has done.  By the way, I
have dined at the Vineyard.(59)  I dare not trust you with what
I think, but I was a little disappointed.  To-morrow we go to
the ruins of the Abbey of St. Osyth; it is the seat of the
Rochfords, but I never chose to go there while they were there.
You will probably hear from Mr. Lyttelton (if in any pause of
love he rests) that I am going to be first minister to the
Prince: in short, I have occasioned great speculation, and
diverted myself with the important mysteries that have been
alembicked out of a trifle.  In short, he had seen my AEdes
Walpolianae at Sir Luke Schaub's, and sent by him to desire
one.  I sent him one bound quite in coronation robes, and went
last Sunday to thank him for the honour.  There were all the
new knights of the garter.  After the prince had whispered
through every curl of lord Granville's periwig, he turned to me,
and said such a crowd of civil things that I did not know
what to answer; commended the style and the quotations; said I
had sent him back to his Livy; in short, that there were but
two things he disliked--one, that I had not given it to him of
my own accord, and the other, that I had abused his friend
Andrea del Sarto; and that he insisted, when I came to town
again, I should come and see two very fine ones that he has
lately bought of that master.  This drew on a very long
conversation on painting, every word of which I suppose will be
reported at the other court as a plan of opposition for the
winter.  Prince George was not there: when he went to receive
the riband, the Prince carried him to the closet door, where
the Duke of Dorset received and carried him.  Ayscough,(60) or
Nugent. or some of the geniuses, had taught him a speech; the
child began it', the Prince cried "No, no!"  When the boy had a
little recovered his fright, he began again; but the same
tremendous sounds were repeated, and the oration still-born.

I believe that soon I shall have a pleasanter tale to tell you;
it is said my Lady Anson, not content with the profusion of the
absurdities she utters, (by the way, one of her sayings, and
extremely in the style of Mr. Lyttelton's making love, was, as
she sat down to play at brag at the corner of a square table:
Lady Fitzwalter said she was sorry she had not better room; "O!
Madam," said my Lady Anson, "I can sit like a nightingale, with
my breast against a thorn;") in short, that, not content with
so much wit, she proposes to entertain the town to the tune of
Doctors' Commons.  She does not mince her disappointments: here
is an epigram that has been made on the subject:-

"As Anson his voyage to my lady was reading,
And recounting his dangers--thank God she's not breeding!
He came to the passage, where, like the old Roman,
He stoutly withstood the temptation of woman;
The Baroness smiled; when continuing, he said,
"Think what terror must there fill the poor lover's head."
"Alack!" quoth my lady, "he had nothing to fear,
Were that Scipio as harmless as you are, my dear."

(59) Mr. Chute's.

(60) Francis Ayscough, Dean of Bristol, tutor to Prince
George.-E.



36 Letter 9
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 20th, 1749.

I am returned to my Strawberry, and find it in such beauty,
that I shall be impatient till I see you and your sisters here.
They must excuse me if I don't marry for their reception; for
it is said the Drax's have impeached fifteen more damsels, and
till all the juries of matrons have finished their inquest, one
shall not care to make one's choice: I was going to say, "throw
one's handkerchief," but at present that term would be a little
equivocal.

As I came to town I was extremely entertained with some
excursions I made out of the road in search of antiquities.  At
Layer Marney is a noble old remnant of the palace of the Lords
of Marney, with three very good tombs in the church well
preserved.  At Messing I saw an extreme fine window of painted
glass in the church; it is the duties prescribed in the Gospel
of visiting the sick  and prisoners, etc.  I mistook, and
called it the seven deadly sins.  There is a very old tomb of
Sir Robert Messing, that built the church.  The hall-place is a
fragment of an old house belonging to Lord  Grimston;(61)  Lady
Luckyn his mother, of fourscore and six, lives in it with an
old son and daughter.  The servant who showed it told us much
history of another brother that had been parson there: this
history was entirely composed of the anecdotes of the doctor's
drinking. who, as the man told us, had been a blood.  There are
some Scotch arms taken from the rebels in the '15, and many old
coats of arms on glass brought from Newhall, which now belongs
to Olmius.  Mr. Conyers bought a window(62) there for only a
hundred pounds, on which is painted Harry the Eighth and one of
his queens at full length: he has put it up at Copt-hall, a
seat which he has bought that belonged to Lord North and Grey.
You see I persevere in my heraldry.  T'other day the parson of
Rigby's parish dined with us; he has conceived as high an
opinion of my skill in genealogies, as if I could say the first
chapter of Matthew by heart.  Rigby drank my health to him, and
that I might come to be garter king at arms: the poor man
replied with great zeal, "I wish he may with all my heart."
Certainly, I am born to preferment; I gave an old woman a penny
once, who prayed that I might live to be lord mayor of London!
What pleased me most in my travels was Dr. Sayer's parsonage at
Witham, which, with Southcote's help, whose old Roman Catholic
father lives just by him, he has made one of the most charming
villas in England.  There are sweet meadows falling down a
hill, and rising again on t'other side of the pretiest little
winding stream you ever saw.  You did not at all surprise me
with the relation of the keeper's brutality to your family, or
of his master's to the dowager's handmaid.  His savage temper
increases every day.  George Boscawen is in a scrape with him
by a court-martial, of which he is one; it was appointed on a
young poor soldier, who to see his friends had counterfeited a
furlough only for a day.  They ordered him two hundred lashes;
but Molkejunskoi, who loves blood like a leech, insisted it was
not enough-has made them sit three times (though every one
adheres to the first sentence,) and swears they shall sit these
six months till they increase the punishment.  The fair Mrs.
Pitt has been mobbed in the Park, and with difficulty rescued
by some gentlemen, only because this bashaw is in love with
her.  You heard, I suppose, of his other amour with the
Savoyard girl.  He sent her to Windsor and offered her a hundred
pounds, which she refused because he was a heretic; he sent her
back on foot.  Inclosed is a new print on this subject, which I
think has more humour than I almost ever saw in one of that sort.

Should I not condole with you upon the death of the head of the
Cues?(63)  If' you have not heard his will, I will tell you.
The settled estate of eight thousand a year is to go between
the two daughters, out of which is a jointure of three thousand
a year to the Duchess-dowager, and to that he has added a
thousand more out of the unsettled estate, which is nine
thousand.  He gives, together with his blessing, four thousand
per annum rent-charge to the Duchess of Manchester in present,
provided she will contest nothing with her sister, who is to
have all the rest, and the reversion of the whole after Lady
Cardigan and her children; but in case she disputes, Lady
Hinchinbrooke and hers are in the entail next to the Cardigans,
who are to take the Montagu name and livery.  I don't know what
Mr. Hussey will think of the blessing, but they say his Duchess
will be inclined to mind it; she always wanted to be well with
her father, but hated her mother.  There are two codicils, one
in favour of his servants, and the other of' his dogs, cats,
and creatures; which was a little unnecessary, for lady
Cardigan has exactly his turn for saving every thing's life.
As he was making the codicil, One of his cats jumped on his
knee; "What," says he, "have you a mind to be a witness too!
You can't, for you are a party concerned." Lord Stafford is
going to send his poor wife with one maid and one horse to a
farm-house in Shropshire for ever.  The Mirepoix's are come;
but I have not yet seen them.  A thousand compliments to your
sisters.

(61) Sir Samuel Grimston, Bart. left an heiress, who married
Sir Capel Luckyn, bart.  Their son changed his name to
Grimston, and was created a baron and a Viscount.

(62) This window is now in St. Margaret's Church, Westminster.

38 letter 10
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 24, 1749.

You and Dr. Cocchi have made me ashamed with the civilities you
showed to my book-I hope it blushed!

You have seen the death of the Duke of Montagu(64) in all the
papers.  His loss will be extremely felt! he paid no less than
2700 pounds a year in private pensions, which ought to be
known, to balance the immense history of his places; of which
he was perpetually obtaining new, and making the utmost of all:
he had quartered on the great wardrobe no less than thirty
nominal tailors and arras-workers. - This employment is to be
dropped; his others are not yet given away.  My father had a
great opinion of his understanding, and at the beginning of the
 war was most desirous of persuading him to be Generalissimo;
but the Duke was very diffident of himself, and, having seen
little service, would not accept it, In short, with some foibles,
he was a most amiable man, and one of the most feeling I ever
knew.  His estate is 17,000 pounds a year; the Duchess of
Manchester must have four of it; all the rest he has given,
after four thousand a year to the Duchess-dowager shall fall
in, to his other daughter Lady Cardigan.  Lord Vere
Beauclerc(65) has thrown his into the list of vacant
employments: he resigned his lordship of the admiralty on
Anson's being preferred to him for vice-admiral of England; but
what heightened the disgust, was Lord Vere's going to a party
to visit the docks with Sandwich and Anson, after this was
done, and yet they never mentioned it to him.  It was not
possible to converse with them upon good terms every day
afterwards.  You perceive our powers and places are in a very
fluctuating situation: the Prince will have a catalogue of
discontented ready to fill the whole civil list.  My Lord
Chancellor was terrified the other day with a vision of such a
revolution; he saw Lord Bath kiss hands, and had like to have
dropped the seals with the agony of not knowing what it was
for--it was only for his going to Spa.  However, as this is an
event which the Chancellor has never thought an impossible one,
he is daily making Christian preparation against it.  He has
just married his other daughter to Sir John Heathcote's
son;(66) a Prince little inferior to Pigwiggin in person; and
procreated in a greater bed of money and avarice than Pigwiggin
himself: they say, there is a peerage already promised to him
by the title of Lord Normanton.  The King has consented to give
two earldoms to replace the great families of Somerset and
Northumberland in their descendants; Lady Betty Smithson is to
have the latter title after the Duke of Somerset's death, and
Sir Charles Windham any other appellation he shall choose.  You
know Lord Granville had got a grant of Northumberland for him,
but it was stopped.  These two hang a little, by the Duke of
Somerset's wanting to have the earldom for his son-in-law,(67)
instead of his daughter.(68)

You ask me about the principles of the Methodists: I have tried
to learn them, and have read one of their books.  The visible
part seems to be nothing but stricter practice than that of our
church, clothed in the old exploded cant of mystical devotion.
For example, you take a metaphor; we will say our passions are
weeds; you immediately drop every description of the passions,
and adopt every thing peculiar to weeds: in five minutes a true
Methodist will talk with the greatest compunction of hoeing--this
catches women of fashion and shopkeepers.

I have now a request to make to you: Mrs. Gibberne is extremely
desirous of having her son come to England for a short time.
There is a small estate left to the family, I think by the
uncle; his presence is absolutely necessary: however, the poor
woman is so happy in his situation with you, that she talks Of
giving up every thing rather than disoblige you by fetching him
to England.  She has been so unfortunate as to lose a favourite
daughter ' that was just married greatly to a Lisbon merchant:
the girl was so divided in her affections, that she had a mind
not to have followed her husband to Portugal.  Mrs. Leneve, to
comfort the poor woman, told her what a distress this would
have been either way: she was so struck with this position,
that she said, "Dear Madam, it is very lucky she died!"--and
since that, she has never cried, but for joy! Though it is
impossible not to smile at these awkward sensations of
unrefined nature, yet I am sure your good nature will agree
with me in giving the poor creature this satisfaction; and
therefore I beg it.  Adieu!

40 Letter 11
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Aug. 17, 1749.

I hear of nothing but your obliging civilities to the
Barrets:(69) I don't wonder you are attentive to please; my
amazement is, when I find it well distributed: you have all
your life been making Florence agreeable to every body that
came there, who have almost all forgot it--or worse.  But Mr.
and Mrs. Barret do you justice, and as they are very sensible
and agreeable, I am persuaded you will always find that they
know how to esteem such goodness as yours.  Mr. Chute has, this
morning received here a letter from Mr. ]Barret, and will
answer it very soon.  Mr. Montagu is here too, and happy to
hear he is so -well, and recommends several compliments to your
conveyance.

Your brother mentions your being prevented writing to me, by
the toothache: I hate you should have any pain.

You always let us draw upon you for such weight of civilities
to any body we recommend, that if I did not desire to show my
attention, and the regard I have for Count LorenZi,(70) yet it
would be burning ingratitude not to repay you.  I have
accordingly been trying to be very civil to the Chevalier; I
did see him Once at Florence.  To-morrow I am to fetch him
hither to dinner, from Putney, where the Mirepoix's have got a
house.  I gave Madame her father's simple\ letter, of which she
took no more notice than it deserved; but Prince Beauvau(71) has
written her a very particular one about me, and
is to come over himself in the winter to make me a visit: this
has warmed their politesse.  I should have known the
Ambassadress any where by the likeness to her family.  He is
cold and stately, and not much tasted here.  She is very
sensible; but neither of them satisfy me in one point; I wanted
to see something that was the quintessence of the newest bon
ton, that had the last bel air, and spoke the freshest jargon.
These people have scarce ever lived at Paris, are reasonable,
and little amusing with follies.  They have brought a cousin
of' his, a Monsieur de Levi, who has a tantino of what I wanted
to see.  You know they pique themselves much upon their Jewish
name, and call cousins with the Virgin Mary.  They have a
picture in the family, where she is made to say to the founder
of the house, "Couvrez vous, Mon cousin."  He replies, "Non
pas, ma tr`es sainte cousine, je scai trop bien le respect que
je vous dois."(72)

There is nothing like news: Kensington Palace was like to have
made an article the other night; it was on fire: my Lady
Yarmouth has an ague, and is forced to keep a constant fire in
her room against the damps.  When my Lady Suffolk lived in that
apartment, the floor produced a constant crop of mushrooms.
Though there are so many vacant chambers, the King hoards all
he can, and has locked up half the palace since the queen's
death: so he does at St. James's, and I believe would put the
rooms out on interest, if he could get a closet a year for
them! Somebody told my Lady Yarmouth they wondered she could
live in that unwholesome apartment, when there are so many
other rooms: she replied, "Mais pas pour moy."

The scagliola tables are arrived, and only one has suffered a
little on the edge: the pattern is perfectly pretty.  It would
oblige me much if you could make the Friar make a couple more
for me, and with a little more expedition.

Don't be so humble about your pedigree: there is not a pipe of
good blood in the kingdom but we will tap for you: Mr. Chute
has it now in painting; and you may depend on having it with
the most satisfactory proofs, as soon as it can possibly be
finished.  He has taken great pains, and fathomed half the
genealogies in England for you.

You have been extremely misinformed about my father's writing
his own history: I often pressed it, but he never once threw a
thought that way.  He neither loved reading nor writing; and at
last, the only time he had leisure, was not well enough.  He
used to say, "that but few men should ever be ministers, for it
let them see too much of the badness of mankind."  Your story,
I imagine, was inoculated on this speech.  Adieu!

France.-D.

42 Letter 12
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, August 26, 1749.

Dear George,
I flatter myself that you are quite recovered of your disorder,
and that your sisters will not look with an evil eye on
Strawberry Hill.  Mr. Chute and I are returned from our
expedition miraculously well, considering all our distresses.
If you love good roads, conveniences, good inns, plenty of
postilions and horses, be so kind as never to go into Sussex.
We thought ourselves in the northest part of England; the whole
country has a Saxon air, and the inhabitants are savage, as if
King George the Second had been the first monarch of the East
Angles.  Coaches grow there no more than balm and spices; we
were forced to drop our postchaise, that resembled nothing so
much as harlequin's calash, which was occasionally a chaise or
a baker's cart.  We journeyed over Alpine mountains, drenched
in clouds, and thought of harlequin again, when he was driving
the chariot of the sun through the morning clouds, and so was
glad to hear the aqua vitae man crying a dram.  At last we got
to Arundel Castle, which was visibly built for defence in an
impracticable country.  It is now only a heap of ruins, with a
new indifferent apartment clapt up for the Norfolks, when they
reside there for a week or a fortnight.  Their priest showed us
about.  There are the walls of a round tower where the garrison
held out against Cromwell; he planted a battery on the top of
the church, and reduced them.  There is a gloomy gateway and
dunccons, in one of which I conclude is kept the old woman who,
in the time of the late rebellion, offered to show Lord Robert
Sutton(73) where arms were hidden at Worksop.(74)  The Duchess
complimented him into dining before his search, and in the mean
time the woman was spirited away, and adieu the arms.  There
are fine monuments of the old Fitzalans, Earls of Arundel, in
the church.  Mr. Chute, whom I have created Strawberry king at
arms, has had brave sport a la chasse aux armes.

We are charmed with the magnificence of the park at
Petworth,(75) which is Percy to the backbone; but the house and
garden did not please our antiquarian spirit.  The house is
entirely new-fronted in the style of the Tu'lleries, and
furnished exactly like Hampton Court.  There is one room
gloriously flounced all round whole-length pictures, with much
the finest carving of Gibbins that ever my eyes beheld.  There
are birds absolutely feathered; and two antique vases with bas
relieves, as perfect and beautiful as if they were carved by a
Grecian master.  There is a noble Claude Lorrain, a very
curious Picture of the haughty Anne Stanhope, the Protector's
wife,(76) pretty
but not giving one an idea of her character, and many old
portraits; but the housekeeper was at London, and we did not
learn half.  The chapel is grand and proper.  At the inn we
entertained ourselves with the landlord, whom my Lord Harvey
had cabineted when he went to woo one of the Lady Seymours.

Our greatest pleasure was in seeing Cowdry, which is repairing;
Lord Montacute(77) will at last live in it.  We thought of old
Margaret of Clarence, who lived there; one of her accusations
was built on the bulls found there.  It was the palace of her
great uncle, the Marquis of Montacute.  I was charmed with the
front, and the court, and the fountain; but the room called
Holbein's, except the curiosity of it, is wretchedly painted,
and infinitely inferior to those delightful stories of Harry
the Eighth in the private apartment at Windsor.  I was much
pleased with a whole length picture of Sir Anthony Brown in the
very dress in which he wedded Anne of Cleves by proxy.  He is
in blue and white, only his right leg is entirely white, which
was certainly robed for the act of putting into bed to her; but
when the King came to marry her, he only put his leg into bed
to kick her out of it.

I have set up my staff, and finished my pilgrimages for this
year.  Sussex is a great damper of curiosity.  Adieu! my
compliments to your sisters.

(73) lord Robert Sutton, third son of the Duke of rutland.

(74) A seat of the Duke of Norfolk in Nottinghamshire.

(75) A seat of Sir Charles Wyndham, who succeeded to the title
of Earl of Egremont on the death of his uncle Algernon, Duke of
Somerset.

(76) Second wife of Edward, Duke of Somerset, Protector in the
reign of his nephew, Edward VI.-E.

(77) Anthony, the sixth Viscount Montagu, descended from
Anthony Brown, created Viscount Montagu in 1554, being
descended from John Neville, Marquis of Montagu.



43 Letter 13
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 12, 1749,

I have your two letters to answer of August 15th and 26, and,
as far as I see before me, have a great deal of paper, which I
don't know how to fill.  The town is notoriously empty; at
Kensington they have scarce company enough to pay for lighting
the candles.  The Duke has been for a week with the Duke of
Bedford at Woburn; Princess Emily remains, saying civil things;
for example, the second time she saw Madame de Mircpoix, she
cried out, "Ah! Madame, vous n'avez pas tant de rouge
aujourd'hui: la premi`ere fois que vous `etes `a not venue ici,
vous aviez une quantit`e horrible."  This the Mirepoix herself
repeated to me; you may imagine her astonishment,--I mean, as
far as your duty will give you leave.  I like her extremely;
she has a great deal of quiet sense.  They try much to be
English and whip into frocks without measure, and fancy they
are doing the fashion.  Then she has heard so much of that
villanous custom of giving money to the servants of other
people, that there is no convincing her that women of fashion
never give; she distributes with both hands.  The Chevalier
Lorenzi has dined with me here: I gave him venison, and, as he
was determined to like it, he protested it was "as good as
beef."  You will be delighted with what happened to him: he was
impatient to make his brother's compliments to Mr. Chute, and
hearing somebody at Kensington call Mr. Schutz, he easily mistook
the sound, and went up to him, and asked him if he had not been
at Florence!  Schutz with the utmost Hanoverian gravity, replied,
"Oui, oui, J'ai `et`e `a Florence, oui, oui:--mais o`u est-il,
ce Florence?"

The Richcourts(78) are arrived, and have brought with them a
strapping lad of your Count; sure, is it the boy my Lady O.
used to bring up by hand? he is pretty picking for her now.
The woman is handsome, but clumsy to a degree, and as much too
masculine as her lover Rice is too little so.  Sir Charles
Williams too is arrived, and tells me how much he has heard in
your praise in Germany.  Villettes is here, but I have had no
dealings with him.  I think I talk nothing but foreign
ministers to-day, as if I were just landed from the Diet of
Ratisbon.  But I shall have done on this chapter, and I think
on all others, for you say such extravagant things of my
letters, which are nothing but Gossiping gazettes, that I
cannot bear it.  Then you have undone yourself with me, for you
compare them to Madame Sevign`e,'s; absolute treason! Do you
know, there is scarce a book in the world I love so much as her
letters?

How infinitely humane you are about Gibberne!  Shall I amuse
you with the truth of that history, which I have discovered?
The woman, his mother, has pressed his coming for a very
private reason--only to make him one of the most considerable
men in this country!-and by what wonderful means do you think
this mighty business is to be effected? only by the beauties of
his person! As I remember, he was as little like an Adonis as
could be: you must keep this inviolably; but depend upon the
truth of it-I mean, that his mother really has this idea.  She
showed his picture to--why, to the Duchess of Cleveland, to the
Duchess of Portsmouth, to Madame Pompadour; in short, to one of
them, I don't know which, I only know it was not to my Lady
Suffolk, the King's former mistress.  "Mon Dieu! Madame, est-il
frai que fotrc fils est si sholi que ce bortrait? il faut que
je le garte; je feux apsolument l'afoir."  The woman protested
nothing ever was so handsome as her lad, and that the nasty
picture did not do him half justice.  In short, she flatters
herself that the Countess(79) will do him whole justice-.  I
don't think it impossible but, out of charity, she may make him
groom of the chambers.  I don't know, indeed, how the article
of beauty may answer; but if you should lose your Gibberne, it
is good to have @ a friend at court.

Lord Granby is going to be married to the eldest of the Lady
Seymours; she has above a hundred and thirty thousand pounds.
The Duke of Rutland will take none of it, but gives at present
six thousand a-year.

That I may keep my promise to myself of having nothing to tell
you I shall bid you good night; but I really do know no more.
Don't whisper my anecdote even to Gibberne, if he is not yet
set out; nor to the Barrets.  I wish you a merry, merry baths
of Pisa, as the link-boys say at Vauxhall.  Adieu!

(78) Count Richcourt, brother of the minister at Florence, and
envoy from the Emperor; his wife was a Piedmontese.

(79) Lady Yarmouth.



45 Letter 14
To John Chute, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 22, 1749.

My dear sir,
I expect Sir Charles Williams to scold me excessively.  He
wrote me a letter, in which he desired that I would send you
word by last Post, that he expected to meet you here by
Michaelmas, according to your promise.  I was unfortunately at
London; the letter was directed hither from Lord Ilchester's,
where he is; and so I did not receive it till this morning.  I
/hope, however, this will be time enough to put you in mind of
your appointment; but while I am so much afraid of Sir
Charles's anger, I seem to forget the pleasure I shall have in
seeing you myself; I hope you know that: but he is still The
more pressing, as he will stay so little time in England.
Adieu!



45 Letter 15
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 28, 1749.

I am much obliged to you, dear sir, and agree with your opinion
about the painting of Prince Edward, that it cannot be original
and authentic, and consequently not worth copying.  Lord
Cholmondeley is, indeed, an original; but who are the wise
people that build for him?  Sir Philip Harvey seems to be the
only person likely to be benefited by this new extravagance.  I
have just seen a collection of tombs like those you describe--
the house of Russel robed in alabaster and painted.  There are
seven monuments in all; one is immense, in marble, cherubim'd
and seraphim'd, crusted with bas-reliefs and titles, for the
first Duke of Bedford and his Duchess.(80)  All these are in a
chapel of the church at Cheneys, the seat of the first Earls.
There are but piteous fragments of the house remaining, now a
farm, built round three sides of a court.  It is dropping down,
in several places without a roof, but in half the windows are
beautiful arms in painted glass.  As these are so totally
neglected, I propose making a push, and begging them of the
Duke of Bedford.  They would be magnificent for
Strawberry-castle.  Did I tell you that I have found a text in
Deuteronomy to authorize my future battlements?  "When thou
buildest a new house, then shalt thou make a battlement for thy
roof, that thou bring not blood upon thy house, if any man fall
from thence."

I saw Cheneys at a visit I have been making to Harry Conway at
Latimers.  This house, which they have hired, is large, and
bad, and old, but of a bad age; finely situated on a hill in a
beech wood, with a river at the bottom, and a range of hills
and woods on the opposite side belonging to the Duke of
Bedford.  They are fond of it; the view is melancholy.  In the
church at Cheneys Mr. Conway put on an old helmet we found
there: you cannot imagine how it suited him, how antique and
handsome he looked; you would have taken him for Rinaldo.  Now
I have dipped you so deep in heraldry and genealogies, I shall
beg you to step into the church of Stoke; I know it is not
asking you to do, a disagreeable thing to call there; I want an
account of the tomb of the first Earl of Huntingdon, an
ancestor of mine, who lies there.  I asked Gray, but he could
tell me little about it. You know how out of humour Gray has
been about our diverting ourselves with pedigrees, which is at
least as wise as making a serious point of haranguing against
the study.  I believe neither Mr. Chute nor I ever contracted a
moment's vanity from any of our discoveries,
 or ever preferred them to any thing but brag and whist.  Well,
Gray has set himself to compute, and has found out that there
must go a million of ancestors in twenty generations to every
body's composition.

I dig and plant till it is dark; all my works are revived and
proceeding.  When will you come and assist? You know I have an
absolute promise, and shall now every day expect you.  My
compliments to your sisters.

(80) Anne, daughter of Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset.




46 Letter 16
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, October 27, 1749.

You never was more conveniently in fault in your life: I have
been going to make you excuses these ten days for not writing;
and while I was inventing them, your humble letter of Oct. 10th
arrives.  I am so glad to find it is you that are to blame, not
I. Well, well, I am all good nature, I forgive you; I can
overlook such little negligences.

Mr. Chute is indefatigable in your service, but Anstis(81) has
been very troublesome; he makes as many difficulties in signing
a certificate about folks that are dead as if they were
claiming an estate.  I am sorry you are so pressed, for poor
Mr. Chute is taken off from this pursuit: he was fetched from
hence this day se'nnight to his infernal brother's, where a
Mrs. Mildmay, whom you must have heard him mention, is dead
suddenly: this may turn out a very great misfortune to our
friend.

Your friend, Mr. Doddington, has not quite stuck to the letter
of the declaration he sent you: he is first minister at
Carlton-house, and is to lead the Opposition; but the misfortune
is, nobody will be led by him.  That whole court is in disorder
by this event: every body else laughs.

I am glad the Barrets please you, and that I have pleased Count
Lorenzi.  I must tell a speech of the Chevalier, which you will
reconnoitre for Florentine; one would think he had seen no more
of the world than his brother.(82)  He was visiting Lady
Yarmouth with Mirepoix: he drew a person into a window, and
whispered him; Dites moi un peu en ami, je vous en prie; qu'est
ce que c'est que Miledi Yarmouth."--"Eh! bien, vous ne savez
pas?"--"Non, ma foi: nous savons ce que c'est que Miledi
Middlesex.,"

Gibberne is arrived.  I don't tell you this apropos to the
foregoing paragraph: he has wanted to come hither, but I have
waived his visit till I am in town.

I announce to you the old absurd Countess--not of Orford, but
Pomfret.  Bistino will have enough to do: there is Lady
Juliana,(83) who is very like, but not so handsome as Lady
Granville; 'and Lady Granville's little child.  They are
actually in France; I don't doubt but you will have them.  I
shall pity you under a second edition of her follies.  Adieu!
Pray ask my pardon for my writing you so short a letter.

(81) Garter King at Arms. (It was to him Lord Chesterfield
said, "You foolish man, you do not know your own foolish
business."-D.)

(82) Who had never been out of Tuscany.

(83) In 1751 married to Thomas Penn, Esq. of Stoke Pogies.  See
ant`e, p. 13, letter 1.-E.



47 Letter 17
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 17, 1749.

At last I have seen le beau Gibberne: I was extremely glad to
see him, after I had done contemplating his person, which
surely was never designed to figure in a romance.  I never saw
a creature so grateful!  It is impossible not to be touched
with the attachment he has for you.  He talks of returning;
and, indeed, I would advise it for his sake: he is quite
spoiled for living in England, and had entirely forgot what
Visigoths his countrymen are.  But I must drop him to thank you
for the charming intaglio which you have stolen for me by his
means: it is admired as much as it deserves; but with me it has
all the additional merit of coming from you.  Gibberne says you
will be frightened at a lamentable history(84 that you will
read of me in the newspapers; but pray don't be frightened:
-the danger, great as it was, was over before I had any notion
of it; and the hurt did not deserve mentioning.  The relation
is so near the truth, that I need not repeat it; and, indeed,
the frequent repetition has 'Been much worse than the robbery.
I have at last been relieved by the riots(85) at the new French
theatre, and by Lord Coke's lawsuit.(86)  The first has been
opened twice; the latter to-day.  The young men of fashion, who
espouse the French players, have hitherto triumphed: the old
ladies, who countenance Lady Mary Coke, are likely to have their
gray beards brought with sorrow to the grave.  It will ,be a new
aera, (or, as my Lord Baltimore calls it, a new area,) in
English history, to have the mob and the Scotch beat out of two
points that they have endeavoured to make national.  I dare say
the Chevalier Lorenzi will write ample accounts to Florence of
these and all our English phenomena.  I think, if possible, we
brutalize more and more: the only difference is, that though
every thing is anarchy, there seems to be less general party
than ever.  The humours abound, but there wants some notable
physician to bring them to a head.

The Parliament met yesterday: we had opposition, but no
division on the address.

Now the Barrets have left you, Mr. Chute and I will venture to
open our minds to you a little; that is, to comfort you for the
loss of your friends - we will abuse them--that is enough in
the way of the world.  Mr. Chute had no kind of acquaintance
with Mr. Barret till just before he set out: I, who have known
him all my life, must tell you that all those nerves are
imaginary, and that as long as there are distempers in the
world, he will have one or two constantly upon his list.  I
don't know her; I never heard much of her understanding, but I
had rather take your opinion; or at least, if I am not
absolutely so complaisant, I will believe that you was
determined to like them on Mr. Chute's account.  I would not
speak so plainly to you (and have not I been very severe?) if I
were not sure that your good nature would not relax any offices
of friendship to them.  You will scold me black and blue; but
you know I always tell you when the goodness of your heart
makes you borrow a little from that of other people to lend to
their heads.  Good night!

(84) Mr. Walpole had been robbed the week before in Hyde Park,
and narrowly escaped being killed by the accidental going off
of the highwayman's pistol, which did stun him, and took off
the skin of his cheekbone.

(85) The mob was determined not to suffer French Players; and
Lord Trentham's engaging in their defence was made great use,
of against him at the ensuing election for Westminster; where
he was to be rechosen, on being appointed a lord of the
admiralty.

(86) Lady Mary Coke swore the peace against her husband.



48 letter 18
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 10, 1750.

I don't at all know what to say to you, for not having writ to
you since the middle of November: I only know that nothing has
happened, and so I have omitted telling you nothing.  I have
had two from you in the interim, one of Nov. @8th, and one
without a date, in which you are extremely kind about my
robbery, of which in my last I assured you there were no
consequences: thank you a thousand times for having felt so
much on my account.  Gibberne has been with me again to-day, as
his mother was a fortnight ago: she talked me to death, and three
times after telling me her whole history, she said, "Well then,
Sir, upon the whole," and began it all again.  Upon the whole, I
think she has a mind to keep her son in England; (-ind he has a
mind to be kept, though in my opinion he is very unfit for living
in England--he is too polished! For trade, she says, he is in a
cold sweat if she mentions it; and so they propose, by the
acquaintance, he says,. his mother has among the quality, to get
him that nothing called something.  I assured them, you had too
much friendship for him to desire his return, if it would be a
prejudice to his interest--did not I say right?  He seems a
good creature; too good to make his way here.

I beg you will not omit sending me every tittle that happens to
compose my Lady Pomfret's second volume.  We see perpetual
articles of the sale of the furniture in the Great Duke's
villas: is there any truth in it? You would know me again, if
you saw me playing at pharaoh on one side of Madame de
Mirepoix, as I used to do by her mother: I like her extremely,
though she likes nothing but gaming.  His pleasure is dancing:
don't you envy any body that can have spirits to be so simple
as to like themselves in a minuet after fifty?  Don't tell his
brother, but the Chevalier Lorenzi is the object of the
family's entertainment.  With all the Italian thirst for
English knowledge, he vents as many absurdities as if he had a
passion for Ireland too.  He saw some of the Florentine Gesses
at Lord Lincoln's; he showed them to the Ambassadress with
great transport, and assured her that the Great Duke had the
originals, and that there never had been made any copies of
them.  He told her the other day that he had seen a sapphire of
the size of her diamond ring,,, and worth more: she said that
could not be. "Oh!" said he, "I mean, supposing your diamond
were a sapphire."

I want to know Dr. Cocchi's and your opinion of two new French
books, if you have seen them.  One is Montesquieu's "Esprit des
Loix;" which I think the best book that ever was written--at
least I never learned half so much from all I ever read.  There
is )s much wit as useful knowledge.  He is said to have hurt
his reputation by it in France, which I can conceive, for it is
almost the interest of every body there that can understand it
to decry it.  The other, far inferior, but entertaining,, is
Hainault's "Abrege Chronologique de l'Histoire de France." It
is very amusing, though very full of Frenchisms; and though an
abridgment, often so minute as to tell you when the
Quinzevingts first wore flower-de-luces on their shoulders: but
there are several little circumstances that give one an idea of
the manners of old time, like Dr. Cocchi's treatise on the old
rate of expenses.

There has been nothing particular in Parliament - all our
conversation has turned on the Westminster election, on which,
after a vast struggle, Lord Trentham had the majority.  Then
came on the scrutiny: after a week's squabbling on the right of
election, the High-bailiff declared what he would take to be
the right.  They are now proceeding to disqualify  votes on that
foot; but as his decision could not possibly please both sides, I
fear it will come to us at last.

Lord Pembroke(87) died last night: he had been at the Bridge
Committee,(88) in the morning, where, according to custom, he
fell into an outrageous passion; as my Lord Chesterfield told
him, that ever since the pier sunk he has constantly been
damming and sinking. The watermen say to-day, that now the
great pier (peer) is quite gone.  Charles Stanhope carried him
home in his chariot; he desired the coachman to drive gently,
for he could not avoid those passions; and afterwards, between
shame and his asthma, he always felt daggers, and should
certainly one day or other die in one of those fits.
Arundel,(89) his great friend and relation, came to him soon
after: he repeated the conversation, and said, he did not know
but he might die by night. "God bless you! If I see you no
more, take this as my last farewell!" He died in his chair at
seven o'clock.  He certainly is a public loss; for he was
public-spirited and inflexibly honest, though prejudice and
passion were so predominant in him that honesty had not fair
play, whenever he had been set upon any point that had been
given him for right.  In his lawsuit with my Lady Portland he
was scurrilously indecent, though to a woman; and so
blasphemous at tennis, that the present primate of Ireland(90)
was forced to leave off playing with him.  Last year he went
near to destroy post-chaises, on a quarrel with the postmaster
at Hounslow, who, as he told the Bishop of Chichester, had an
hundred devils and Jesuits in his belly.  In short, he was one
of the lucky English madmen who get people to say, that
whatever extravagance they commit "Oh, it is his way." He began
his life with boxing, and ended it with living upon vegetables,
into which system avarice a little entered.  At the beginning
of the present war, he very honourably would resign his
regiment, though the King pressed him to keep it, because his
rupture hindered his serving abroad.  My father, with whom he
was always well, would at any time have given him the blue
riband; but he piqued himself on its being offered to him
without asking it.  the truth was, he did not care for the
expense of the instalment.  His great excellence was
architecture: the bridge at Wilton is more beautiful than any
thing of Lord Burlington or Kent.  He has left an only son, a
fine boy about sixteen.(91)  Last week, Lord Crawford(92) died
too, as is supposed, by taking a large quantity of laudanum,
under impatience at the badness of his circumstances, and at
the seventeenth opening of the wound which he got in Hungary,
in a battle with the Turks.  I must tell you a story apropos of
two noble instances of fidelity and generosity.  His servant, a
French papist, saw him fall; watched, and carried him off into
a ditch.  Lord Crawford told him the Turks would certainly find
them, and that, as he could not live himself, it was in vain
for him to risk his life too, and insisted on the man making
his escape.  After a long contest, the servant retired, found a
priest, confessed himself, came back, and told his lord that he
was now prepared to die, and would never leave him.  The enemy
did not return, and both were saved.  After Lord Crawford's
death, this story was related to old Charles Stanhope, Lord
Harrington's brother, whom I mentioned just now: he sent for
the fellow, told him he could not take him himself, but, as
from his lord's affairs he concluded he had not been able to
provide for him, he would give him fifty pounds, and did.

To make up for my long silence, and to make up for a long
letter, I will string another old story, which I have just
heard, to this.  General Wade was at a low gaming-house, and
had a very fine snuffbox, which on a sudden he missed.  Every
body denied having taken it: he insisted on searching the
company.  He did: there remained only one man, who had stood
behind him, but refused to be searched, unless the general
would go into another room alone with him: there the man told
him, that he was born a gentleman, was reduced, and lived by
what little bets he could pick up there, and by fragments which
the waiters sometimes gave him. "At this moment I have half a
fowl in my pocket; I was afraid of being exposed; here it is!
Now, Sir, you may search me." Wade was so struck, that he gave
the man a hundred pounds; and immediately the genius of
generosity, whose province is almost a sinecure, was very glad
of the opportunity of making him find his own snuff-box, or
another very like it, in his own pocket again.

Lord Marchmont is to succeed Lord Crawford as one of the
sixteen: the House of Lords is so inactive that at last the
ministry have ventured to let him in there.  His brother Hume
Campbell, who has been in a state of neutrality, begins to
frequent the House again.

It is plain I am no moneyed man; as I have forgot, till I came
to My last paragraph, what a ferment the money-changers are in!
Mr. Pelham, who has flung himself entirely into Sir John
Barnard's(93) hands, has just miscarried in a scheme for the
reduction of interest, by the intrigues of the three great
companies and other usurers.  They all detest barnard, who, to
honesty and abilities, joins the most intolerable pride. @By my
next, I suppose, you will find that Mr. Pelham is grown afraid
of somebody else, of some director, and is governed by him.
Adieu!--Sure I am out of debt now!

P.S. My dear Sir, I must trouble you with a commission, which I
don't know whether you can execute.  I am going to build a
little Gothic castle at Strawberry Hill.  If you can pick me up
any fragments of old painted glass, arms, or any thing, I shall
be excessively obliged to you.  I can't say I remember any such
things in Italy; but out of old chateaus, I imagine, one might
get it cheap, if there is any.

52 Letter 19
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 31, 1750.

You will hear little news from England, but of robberies;(94)
the numbers of disbanded soldiers and sailors have all taken to
the road, or rather to the street: people are almost afraid of
stirring after it is dark.  My Lady Albemarle(95) was robbed
the other night in Great Russell Street, by nine men: the King
gave her a gold watch and chain the next day.  She says, "the
manner was all"-and indeed so it was, for I never saw a more
frippery present; especially considering how great a favourite
she is, and my Lady Yarmouth's friend.  The monarch is never
less generous than when he has a mind to be so: the only
present he ever made my father was a large diamond, cracked
quite through.  Once or twice, in his younger and gallant days,
he has brought out a handful of maimed topazes and amethysts,
and given them to be raffled for by the maids of honour.  I
told my Lady Yarmouth it had been a great loss to me that there
was no queen, for then I suppose I should have had a watch too
when I was robbed.

We have had nothing remarkable in Parliament, but a sort of
secession the other day on the Mutiny-bill, when Lord Egmont
and the Opposition walked out of the House, because the
ministry would go upon the Report, when they did not like It.
It is a measure of the Prince's court to lie by, and let the
ministry demolish one another, which they are hurrying to do.
The two secretaries(96) are on the brink of declaring war: the
occasion is likely to be given by a Turnpike-bill, contested
between the counties of Bedford and Northampton; and it (,rows
almost as vehement a contest as the famous one between
Aylesbury and Buckingham.  The Westminster election is still
hanging in scrutiny: the Duke of Bedford paid the election,(97)
which he owns to have cost seven thousand pounds; and Lord
Gower pays the scrutiny, which will be at least as much.  This
bustling little Duke has just had another miscarriage in
Cornwall, where he attacked a family-borough of the Morrices.
The Duke(97) espouses the Bedford; and Lord Sandwich is
espoused by both.  He goes once or twice a-week to hunt with the
Duke; and as the latter has taken a turn of gaming, Sandwich, to
make his court and fortune carries a box and dice in his pocket;
and so they throw a main, whenever the hounds are at a fault,
"upon every green hill, and under every green tree."

But we have one shocking piece of news, the dreadful account of
the hurricane in the East Indies: you will see the particulars
in the papers; but we reckon that we don't yet know the worst..
Poor Admiral Boscawen(99) has been most unfortunate during his
whole expedition; and what increases the horror is, that I have
been assured by a very intelligent person, that Lord Anson
projected this business on purpose to ruin Boscawen, who, when
they came together from the victory off Cape Finisterre,
complained loudly of Anson's behaviour.  To silence and to hurt
him, Anson despatched him to Pondicherry, upon slight
intelligence and upon improbable views.

Lord Coke's suit is still in suspense; he has been dying; she
was to have died, but has recovered wonderfully on his taking
the lead.  Mr. Chute diverted me excessively with a confidence
that Chevalier Lorenzi made him the other night-I have told you
the style of his bon-mots! He said he should certainly return
to England again, and that whenever he did, he would land at
Bristol, because baths are the best places to make
acquaintance, just as if Mr. Chute, after living seven years in
Italy, and keeping the best company, should return thither, and
land at Leghorn, in order to make Italian acquaintance at Pisa!

Among the robberies, I might have told you of the eldest Miss
Pelham leaving a pair of diamond earrings, which she had
borrowed for the birth-day, in a hackney chair; she had put
them under the seat for fear of being attacked, and forgot
them.  The chairmen have sunk them.  The next morning, when
they were missed, the damsel began to cry: Lady Catherine(100)
grew frightened, lest her infanta should vex herself sick, and
summoned a jury of matrons to consult whether she should give
her hartshorn or lavender drops?  Mrs. Selwyn,(101) who was on
the panel, grew very peevish, and said, "Pho! give her
brilliant drops."  Such are the present anecdotes of the court
of England! Adieu!

(94) On the preceding day, in consequence of the number of
persons of distinction who had recently been robbed in the
streets, a proclamation appeared in the London Gazette,
offering a reward of one hundred pounds for the apprehension of
any robber.-E.

53 letter 20
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Feb. 25, 1750.

I am come hither for a little repose and air.  The fatigue of a
London winter, between Parliaments and rakery, is a little too
much without interruption for an elderly personage, that verges
towards--I won't say what.  This accounts easily for my wanting
quiet--but air in February will make you smile--yet it is
strictly true, that the weather is unnaturally hot: we have had
eight months of' warmth beyond what was ever known in any other
country; Italy is quite north with respect to us!-You know we
have had an earthquake.  Mr. Chute's Francesco says, that a few
evenings before it there was a bright cloud, which the mob
called the bloody cloud; that he had been told there never were
earthquakes in England, or else he should have known by that
symptom that there would be one within a week.  I am told that
Sir Isaac Newton foretold a great alteration in Our climate in
the year '50, and that he wished he could live to see it.
Jupiter, I think, has jogged us three degrees nearer to the
sun.

The Bedford Turnpike, which I announced to you in my last, is
thrown out by a majority of fifty-two against the Duke of
Bedford.  The Pelhams, who lent their own persons to him, had
set up the Duke of Grafton, to list their own dependents under
against their rival.  When the Chamberlain would head a party,
you may be sure the opposite power is in the wane.  The
Newcastle is at open war, and has left off waiting on the Duke,
who espouses the Bedfords.  Mr. Pelham tries to patch it up,
and is getting the Ordnance for the Duke; but there are scarce
any terms kept.  Lord Sandwich, who governs the little Duke
through the Duchess, is the chief object of the Newcastle
hatred.  Indeed there never was such a composition!  he is as
capable of all little knavery, as if he was not practising all
great knavery.  During the turnpike contest, in which he
laboured night and day against his friend Halifax, he tried the
grossest tricks to break agreements, when the opposite side
were gone away on the security of a suspension of action: and
in the very middle of that I came to the knowledge of a cruel
piece of flattery which he paid to his protector.  He had made
interest for these two years for one Parry, a poor clergyman,
schoolfellow and friend of his, to be fellow of Eton, and had
secured a majority for him.  A Fellow died: another wrote to
Sandwich to know if he was not to vote for Parry according to
his engagement,--"No, he must vote for one who had been tutor
to the Duke of Bedford," who by that means has carried it.  My
Lady Lincoln was not suffered to go to a ball which Sandwich
made the other night for the Duke, who tumbled down in the
middle of a country dance; they imagined he had beat his nose
flat, but he lay like a tortoise on the topshell, his face
could not touch the ground by some feet.  My Lady Anson was
there, who insisted on dancing minuets, though against the rule
of the night, with as much eagerness as you remember in my Lady
Granville.  Then she proposed herself for a Louvre; all the men
vowed they had never heard of such a dance, upon which she
dragged out Lady Leveson,(102) and made her dance one with her.

At the last ball at the same house, a great dispute of
precedence, which the Duchess of Norfolk had set on foot but
has dropped, came to trial.  Lord Sandwich contrived to be on
the outside of the door to hand down to supper whatever lady
came out first.  Madame de Mirepoix and the Duchess of Bedford
were the rival queens; the latter made a faint offer to the
ambassadress to go first; she returned it, and the other
briskly accepted it; upon which the ambassadress, with great
cleverness, made all the other women go before her, and then
asked the Duke of Bedford if he would not go too.  However,
though they continue to visit, the wound is incurable: you
don't imagine that a widow(103) of the House of Lorraine, and a
daughter of Princess Craon, can digest such an affront.  It
certainly was very absurd, as she is not only an ambassadress
but a stranger; and consequently all English women, as being at
home, should give her place.  King George the Second and I
don't agree in our explication of this text of ceremony; he
approves the Duchess-so he does Miss Chudleigh, in a point
where ceremony is out of the question.  He opened the trenches
before her a fortnight ago, at the masquerade- but at the last
she had the gout, and could not come; he went away flat, cross.
His son is not so fickle.  My Lady Middlesex has been
miscarrying; he attends as incessantly as Mrs. Cannon.(104)
The other morning the Princess came to call him to go to Kew;
he made her wait in her coach above half an hour at the door.
You will be delighted with a bon-mot of a chair-maker, whom he
has discarded for voting for Lord Trentham; one of his
black-caps was sent to tell this Vaughan that the Prince would
employ him no more: "I am going to bid another person make his
Royal Highness a chair."--"With all my heart," said the
chair-maker; "I don't care what they make him, so they don't
make him a throne."

The Westminster election, which is still scrutinizing, produced
us a parliamentary event this week, and was very near producing
something much bigger.  Mr. Fox and Mr. Pitt moved to Send for
the High-bailiff to inquire into the delay.  The Opposition
took it up very high, and on its being carried against them,
the Court of Requests was filled next day with the mob, and the
House crowded, and big with expectation.  Nugent had flamed and
abused Lord Sandwich violently, as author of this outrageous
measure.  When the Bailiff appeared, the pacific spirit of the
other part of the administration had operated so much, that he
was dismissed with honour; and Only instructed to abridge all
delays by authority of the House-in short, "we spit in his hat
on Thursday, and wiped it off on Friday."  This is a now
fashionable proverb, which I must construe to you.  About ten
days ago, at the new Lady Cobham's(105) assembly, Lord
Hervey(106) was leaning over a chair, talking to some women,
and holding his hat in his hand.  Lord Cobham came up and spit in
it--yes,
spit in it!--and then, with a loud laugh, turned to Nugent, and
said, "Pay me my wager."  In short, he had laid a guinea that
he committed this absurd brutality, and that it was not
resented.  Lord Hervey, with great temper and sensibility,
asked if he had any farther occasion for his hat?--"Oh! I see
you are angry!"--"Not very well pleased." Lord Cobham took the
fatal hat and wiped it, made a thousand foolish apologies, and
wanted to pass it for a joke.  Next morning he rose with the
sun, and went to visit Lord Hervey; so did Nugent: he would not
see them, but wrote to the Spitter, (or, as he is now called,
Lord Gob'em,) to say, that he had affronted him very grossly
before company, but having involved Nugent in it, he desired to
know to which he was to address himself for satisfaction.  Lord
Cobham wrote him a most submissive answer, and begged pardon
both in his own and Nugent's name.  Here it rested for a few
days; till getting wind, Lord Hervey wrote again to insist on
an explicit apology under Lord Cobham's own hand, with a
rehearsal of the excuses that had been made to him.  This, too,
was complied with, and the fair conqueror(107) shows all the
letters.(108)  Nugent's disgraces have not ended here: the
night of his having declaimed so furiously he was standing by
Lady Catherine Pelham, against Lord Sandwich at the masquerade,
without his mask: she was telling him a history of a mad dog,
(which I believe she had bit herself.) young Leveson, the
Duchess of Bedford's brother, came up, without his mask too,
and looking at Nugent, said, , I have seen a mad dog to-day,
and a silly dog too."--"I suppose, Mr. Leveson,(109) you have
been looking in a glass."--"No, I see him now."  Upon which
they walked off together, but were prevented from fighting, (if
Nugent would have fought,) and were reconciled at the
side-board.  You perceive by this that our factions are
ripening.  The Argyll(110) carried all the Scotch against the
turnpike: they were willing to be carried, for the Duke of
Bedford, in case it should have come into the Lords, had writ
to the sixteen Peers to solicit their votes; but with so little
deference, that he enclosed all the letters under one cover,
directed to the British Coffee-house!

The new Duke of Somerset(111) is dead: that title is at last
restored to Sir Edward Seymour, after his branch had been most
unjustly deprived of it for about one hundred and fifty years.
Sir Hugh Smithson and Sir Charles Windham are Earls of
Northumberland and Egremont, with vast estates; the former
title, revived for the blood of Percy, has the misfortune of
being coupled with the blood of a man that either let or drove
coaches--such Was Sir Hugh's grandfather!  This peerage vacates
his seat for Middlesex, and has opened a contest for the county,
before even that for Westminster is decided.  The Duchess of
Richmond takes care that house shall not be extinguished: she
again lies in, after having been with child seven-and-twenty
times: but even this is not so extraordinary as the Duke's
fondness for her, or as the vigour of her beauty: her complexion
is as fair and blooming as when she was a bride.

We expect some chagrin on the new regency, at the head of which
is to be the Duke; "Au Augustum fess`a aetate totiens in
Germaniam commeare potuisse," say the mutineers in Tacitus--
Augustus goes in April.  He has notified to my Lord Orford his
having given the reversion of New Park to his daughter Emily;
and has given him leave to keep it in the best repair.  One of
the German women, Madame Munchausen, his minister's wife,
contributes very kindly to the entertainment of the town.  She
is ugly, devout, and with that sort of coquetry which proceeds
from a virtue that knows its own weakness so much as to be
alarmed, even when nothing is meant to its prejudice.(112)  At
a great dinner which they gave last -week, somebody observed
that all the sugar figures in the dessert were girls: the Baron
replied, "Sa est frai; ordinairement les petits cupitons sont
des garsons; mais ma femme s'est amus`ee toute la matin`ee `a
en `oter tout sa par motestie."  This improvement of hers is a
curious refinement, though all the geniuses of the age are
employed in designing new plans for desserts.  The Duke of
Newcastle's last was a baby Vauxhall, illuminated with a
million of little lamps of various colours.

We have been sitting this fortnight on the African Company: we,
the British Senate, that temple of liberty, and bulwark of
Protestant Christianity, have this fortnight been pondering
methods to make more effectual that horrid traffic of selling
negroes.  It has appeared to us that six-and-forty thousand of
these wretches are sold every year to our plantations alone!--
It chills one's blood.  I would not have to say that I voted in
it for the continent of America!(113)  The destruction of the
miserable inhabitants by the Spaniards was but a momentary
misfortune, that flowed from the discovery of the New World,
compared to this lasting havoc which it brought upon Africa.
We reproach Spain, and yet do not even pretend the nonsense of
butchering these poor creatures for the good of their souls!

I have just received your long letter of February 13th, and am
pleased that I had writ this volume to return it.  I don't know
how almost to avoid wishing poor Prince Craon dead, to see the
Princess upon a throne.(114)  I am sure she would invert Mr.
Vaughan's wish, and compound to have nothing else made for her,
provided a throne were.

I despise your literati enormously for their opinion of
Montesquieu's book.  Bid them read that glorious chapter on the
subject I have been mentioning, the selling of African slaves.
Where did he borrow that?  In what book in the world is there
half so much wit, sentiment, delicacy, humanity?

I shall speak much more gently to you, my dear child, though
you don't like Gothic architecture.  The Grecian is only proper
for magnificent and public buildings.  Columns and all their
beautiful ornaments look ridiculous when crowded into a closet
or a cheesecake-house.  The variety is little, and admits no
charming irregularities.  I am almost as fond of the
Sharavaggi, or Chinese want of symmetry, in buildings, as in
grounds or gardens.  I am sure, whenever you come to England,
you will be pleased with the liberty of taste into which we are
struck, and of which you can have no idea! Adieu!

58 Letter 21
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 11, 1750.

"Portents and prodigies are grown so frequent,
That they have lost their name."(115)

My text is not literally true; but as far -,is earthquakes go
towards lowering the price of wonderful commodities, to be sure
we are overstocked.  We have had a second much more violent
than the first; and you must not be surprised if by next post
you hear of' a burning mountain sprung up in Smithfield.  In
the night between Wednesday and Thursday last, (exactly a month
since the first shock,) the earth had a shivering fit between
one and two; but so slight that, if no more had followed, I
don't believe it would have been noticed.  I had been awake,
and had scarce dozed again-on a sudden I felt my bolster lift
up my head; I thought somebody was getting from under my bed,
but soon found it was a strong earthquake, that lasted near
half a minute, with a violent vibration and great roaring.  I
rang my bell; my servant came in, frightened out of his senses-
- in an instant we heard all the windows in the neighbourhood
flung up.  I got up and found people running into the streets,
but saw no mischief done: there has been some; two old houses
flung down, several chimneys, and much china-ware.  The bells
rung in several houses.  Admiral Knowles, who has lived long in
Jamaica, and felt seven there, says this was more violent than
any of them; Francesco prefers it to the dreadful one at Leghorn.
The wise say, that if we have not rain soon, we shall certainly
have more.  Several people are going out of town, for it has
nowhere reached above ten miles from London: they say, they are
not frightened, but that it is such fine weather, "Lord! one
can't help going into the country!" The only visible effect it
has had, was on the Ridotto, at which, being the following night,
there were but four hundred people.  A parson, who came into
White's the morning of earthquake the first, and heard bets laid
on whether it was an earthquake or the blowing up of
powder-mills, went away exceedingly scandalized, and said, "I
protest, they are such an impious set of people, that I believe
if the last trumpet was to sound, they would bet puppet-show
against Judgment." If we get any nearer still to the torrid zone,
I shall pique myself on sending you a present of cedrati and
orange-flower water: I am already planning a terreno for
Strawberry Hill.

The Middlesex election is carried against the court: the
Prince, in a green frock, (and I won't swear, but in a Scotch
plaid waistcoat,) sat under the park-wall in his chair, and
hallooed the voters on to Brentford.  The Jacobites are so
transported, that they are opening subscriptions for all
boroughs that shall be vacant--this is wise!  They will spend
their money to carry a few more seats in a Parliament where
they will never have the majority, and so have none to carry
the general elections.  The omen, however, is bad for
Westminster; the High-bailiff went to vote for the Opposition.

I now jump to another topic; I find all this letter will be
detached scraps; I can't at all contrive to hide the scams: but
I don't care.  I began my letter merely to tell you of the
earthquake, and I don't pique myself upon doing any more than
telling you what you would be glad to have told you.  I told
you too how pleased I was with the triumphs of another old
beauty, our friend the Princess.(116)  Do you know, I have
found a history that has a great resemblance to hers; that is,
that will be very like hers, if hers is but like it.  I will
tell it you in as few words as I can.  Madame la Marechale de
l'H`opital was the daughter of a sempstress;(117) a young
gentleman fell in love with her, and was going to be married to
her, but the match was broken off.  An old fermier-general, who
had retired into the province where this happened, hearing the
story, had a curiosity to see the victim; he liked her, married
her, died, and left her enough not to care for her inconstant.
he came to Paris, where the Marechal de l'H`opital married her
for her riches.  After the Marechal's death, Casimir, the
abdicated King of Poland, who was retired into
France, fell in love with the Marechale, and privately married
her.  If the event ever happens, I shall certainly travel to
Nancy, to hear her talk of ma belle-fille la Reine de France.
What pains my lady Pomfret would take to prove(118) that an
abdicated King's wife did not take place of an English
countess; and how the Princess herself would grow still fonder
of the Pretender(119) for the similitude of his fortune with
that of le Roi mon mari! Her daughter, Mirepoix, was frightened
the other night, with Mrs. Nugent's calling out, un voleur! un
voleur!  The ambassadress had heard so much of robbing, that
she did not doubt but dans ce pais cy, they robbed in the
middle of an assembly.  It turned out to be a thief in the
candle!  Good night!

(115) Dryden's All for Love."

(116) The Princess Craon, who, it had been reported, was to
marry Stanislaus Leczinsky, Duke of Loraine and ex-King of
Poland, whose daughter Maria Leczinska was married to Louis the
Fifteenth, King of France.-D.

(117) "This is the story of a woman named Mary Mignot.  She was
near marrying a young man of La Gardie, who afterwards entered
the Swedish service, and became a field-marshal in that
country.  Her first husband was, if I mistake not, a Procureur
of Grenoble; her second was the Marshal de l'H`opital; and her
third is supposed to have been Casimir, the ex-King of Poland,
who had retired, after his abdication, to the monastery of St
Germain des Pr`es.  It does not, however, appear certain
whether Casimir actually married her or not.-D.

(118) Lady Pomfret and Princess Craon did not visit at
Florence, upon a dispute of precedence.

60 Letter 22
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 2, 1750.

You will not wonder so much at our earthquakes as at the
effects they have had.  All the women in town have taken them
up upon the foot of Judgments; and the clergy, who have had no
windfalls of a long season, have driven horse and foot into
this opinion.  There has been a shower of sermons and
exhortations; Secker, the jesuitical Bishop of Oxford, began
the mode.  He heard the women were all going out of town to
avoid the next shock; and so: for fear of losing his Easter
offerings, he set himself to advise them to await God's good
pleasure in fear and trembling.  But what is more astonishing,
Sherlock,(120) who has much better sense, and much less of the
Popish confessor has been running a race with him for the old
ladies, and has written a pastoral letter, of which ten
thousand were sold in two days; and fifty thousand have been
subscribed for, since the two first editions.

I told you the women talked of going out of town: several
families are literally gone, and many more going to-day and
to-morrow; for what adds to the absurdity, is, that the second
shock having happened exactly a month after the former, it
prevails that there will be a third on Thursday next, another
month, which is to swallow up London.  I am almost ready to
burn my letter now I have begun it, lest you should think I am
laughing at you: but it is so true, that Arthur of White's told
me last night, that he should put off the last ridotto, which
was to be on Thursday, because he hears nobody would come to
it.  I have advised several who are going to keep their next
earthquake in the country, to take the bark for it, as it is so
periodic.(121)  Dick Leveson and Mr. Rigby, who had supped and
strived late at Bedford House the other night, knocked at several
doors, and in a watchman's voice cried, "Past four o'clock, and a
dreadful earthquake!"  But I have done with this ridiculous
panic: two pages were too much to talk of it.

We have had nothing in Parliament but trade-bills, on one of
which the Speaker humbled the arrogance of Sir John Barnard,
who had reflected upon the proceedings of the House.  It is to
break up on Thursday Se'nnight, and the King goes this day
fortnight.  He has made Lord Vere Beauclerc a baron,(122) at
the solicitation of the Pelhams, as this Lord had resigned upon
a pique with Lord Sandwich.  Lord Anson, who is treading in the
same path, and leaving the Bedfords to follow his
father-in-law, the Chancellor, is made a privy councillor, with
Sir Thomas Robinson and Lord Hyndford.  Lord Conway is to be an
earl,(123) and Sir John Rawdon(124) (whose follies you
remember, and whose boasted loyalty of having been kicked
downstairs for not drinking the Pretender's health, though even
that was false, is at last rewarded,) and Sir John Vesey are to
be Irish lords; and a Sir William Beauchamp Proctor, and a Mr.
Loyd, Knights of the Bath.

I was entertained the other night at the house of much such a
creature as Sir John Rawdon, and one whom you remember too,
Naylor.  he has a wife who keeps the most indecent house of all
those that are called decent: every Sunday she has a contraband
assembly: I had had a card for Monday a fortnight before.  As
the day was new, I expected a great assembly, but found scarce
six persons.  I asked where the company was--I was answered,
"Oh! they are not come yet: they will be here presently; they
all supped here last night, stayed till morning, and I suppose
are not up yet."

My Lord Bolinbroke has lost his wife.  When she was dying, he
acted grief; flung himself upon her bed, and asked her if she
could forgive him.  I never saw her, but have heard her wit and
parts excessively commended.(125)  Dr. Middleton told me a
compliment she made him two years ago, which I thought pretty.
She said she was persuaded that he was a very great writer, for
she understood his works better than any other English book, and
that she had observed that the best writers were always the most
intelligible.

Wednesday.

I had not time to finish my letter on Monday.  I return to the
earthquake, which I had mistaken; it is to be to-day.  This
frantic terror is so much, that within these three days seven
hundred and thirty coaches have been counted passing Hyde Park
corner, with whole parties removing into the country.  Here is
a good advertisement which I cut out of the papers to-day;

"On Monday next will be published (price 6d.) A true and exact
List of all the Nobility and Gentry who have left, or shall
leave, this place through fear of another Earthquake."

Several women have made earthquake gowns; that is, warm gowns
to sit out of doors all to-night.  These are of the more
courageous.  One woman, still more heroic, is come to town on
purpose: she says, all her friends are in London, and she will
not survive them.  But what will you think of Lady Catherine
Pelham, Lady Frances Arundel,(126) and Lord and Lady
Galway,(127) who go this evening to an inn ten miles out of
town, where they are to play at brag till five in the morning,
and then come back-I suppose, to look for the bones of their
husbands and families under the rubbish.(128)  The prophet of
all this (next to the Bishop of London) is a trooper of Lord
Delawar's who was yesterday sent to Bedlam.  His colonel sent
to the man's wife, and asked her if her husband had ever been
disordered before.  She cried, "Oh dear! my lord, he is not mad
now; if your lordship would but get any sensible man to examine
him, you would find, he is quite in his right mind."

I shall now tell you something more serious: Lord Dalkeith(129)
is dead of the small-pox in three days.  It is so dreadfully
fatal in his family, that besides several uncles and aunts, his
eldest boy died of it last year; and his only brother, who was
ill but two days, putrefied so fast that his limbs fell off as
they lifted the body into the coffin.  Lady Dalkeith is five
months gone with child; she was hurrying to him, but was
stopped on the road by the physician, who told her that it was
a miliary fever.  They were remarkably happy.

The King goes on Monday se'nnight;(130) it is looked upon as a
great event that the Duke of Newcastle has prevailed on him to
speak to Mr. Pitt, who has detached himself from the Bedfords.
The Monarch, who had kept up his Hanoverian resentments, though
he had made him paymaster, is now beat out of the dignity of
his silence: he was to pretend not to know Pitt, and was to be
directed to him by the lord in waiting.  Pitt's jealousy is of
Lord Sandwich, who knows his own interest and unpopularity so
well, that he will prevent any breach, and thereby what you
fear, which yet I think you would have no reason to fear.  I
could not say enough of my anger to your father, but I shall
take care to say nothing, as I have not forgot how my zeal for
you made me provoke him once before.

Your genealogical affair Is in great train, and will be quite
finished in a week or two.  Mr. Chute has laboured at it
indefatigably: General Guise has been attesting the
authenticity of it to-day before a justice of peace.  You will
find yourself mixed with every drop of blood in England that is
worth bottling up-. the Duchess of Norfolk and you grow on the
same bough of the tree.  I must tell you a very curious
anecdote that Strawberry King-at-Arms(131) has discovered by
the way, as he was tumbling over the mighty dead in the
Heralds' office.  You have heard me speak of the great
injustice that the Protector Somerset did to the children of
his first wife, in favour of those by his second; so much, that
he not only had the dukedom settled on the younger brood, but
to deprive the eldest of the title of Lord Beauchamp, which he
wore by inheritance, he caused himself to be anew created
Viscount Beauchamp.  Well, in Vincent's Baronage, a book of
great authority, speaking of the Protector's wives, are these
remarkable words: "Katherina, filia et una Coh. Gul: Fillol de
Fillol's hall in Essex, uxor prima; repudiata, quia Pater ejus
post nuptias eam cognovit."  The Speaker has since referred me
to our journals, where are some notes of a trial in the reign
of James the First, between Edward, the second son of Katherine
the dutiful, and the Earl of Hertford, son of Anne Stanhope,
which in some measure confirms our MS; for it says, the Earl of
Hertford objected, that John, the eldest son of all, was
begotten while the Duke was in France.  This title, which now
comes back at last to Sir Edward Seymour is disputed: my Lord
Chancellor has refused him the writ, but referred his case to
the Attorney General,(132) the present great Opinion of
England, who, they say, is clear for Sir Edward's
succession.(133)

I shall now go and show you Mr. Chute in a different light from
heraldry, and in one in which I believe you never saw him.  He
will shine as usual; but, as a little more severely than his
good-nature is accustomed to, I must tell you that he was
provoked by the most impertinent usage.  It is an epigram on
Lady Caroline Petersham, whose present fame, by the way, is
coupled with young Harry Vane.

WHO IS THIS?

Her face has beauty, we must all confess,
But beauty on the brink of ugliness:
Her mouth's a rabbit feeding on a rose;
With eyes-ten times too good for such a nose!
Her blooming cheeks-what paint could ever draw 'em?
That Paint, for which no mortal ever saw 'em.
Air without shape--of royal race divine--
'Tis Emily--oh! fie!--It'S Caroline.

Do but think of my beginning a third sheet!  but as the
Parliament is rising, and I shall probably not write you a
tolerably long letter again these eight months, I will lay in a
stock of merit with you to last me so long Mr. Chute has set me
too upon making epigrams; but as I have not his art, mine is
almost a copy of verses: the story he told me, and is literally
true, of an old Lady Bingley.(134)

Celia now had completed some thirty campaigns,
And for new generations was hammering chains;
When whetting those terrible weapons, her eyes,
To Jennny, her handmaid, in anger she cries,
"Careless creature! did mortal e'er see such a glass!
Who that saw me in this, could e'er guess what I was!
Much you mind what I say! pray how oft have I bid you
Provide me a new one? how oft have I chid you?"
"Lord, Madam!" cried Jane, "you're so hard to be pleased
I am sure every glassman in town I have teased:
I have hunted each shop from Pall-mall to Cheapside:
Both Miss Carpenter's(135) man and Miss Banks's(136) I've
tried."
"Don't tell me of those girls!-all I know, to my cost,
Is, the looking-glass art must be certainly lost!
One used to have mirrors so smooth and so bright,
They did one's eyes justice, they heighten'd one's white,
And fresh roses diffused o'er ones bloom--but, alas!
In the glasses made now, one detests one's own face;
They pucker one's cheeks up and furrow one's brow,
And one's skin looks as yellow as that of Miss(137) Howe!"(138)

After an epigram that seems to have found out the longitude, I
shall tell you but one more, and that wondrous short.  It is
said to be made by a cow.  YOU Must not wonder; we tell as many
strange stories as Baker and Livy:

"A warm winter, a dry spring,
A hot summer, a new King."

Though the sting is very epigrammatic, the whole of the
distitch has more of the truth than becomes prophecy; that is,
it is false, for the spring is wet and cold.

There is come from France a Madame Bocage, who has translated
Milton. my Lord Chesterfield prefers the copy to the original;
but that is not uncommon for him to do, who is the patron of
bad authors and bad actors.  She has written a play too, which
was damned, and worthy my lord's approbation.' You would be
more diverted with a Mrs. Holman, whose passion is keeping an
assembly, and inviting literally every body to it.  She goes to
the drawing-room to watch for sneezes; whips out a curtsey, and
then sends next morning to know how your cold does, and to
desire your company next Thursday.

Mr. Whithed has taken my Lord Pembroke's house at Whitehall; a
glorious situation, but as madly built as my Lord himself was.
He has bought some delightful pictures too, of Claude, Gaspar,
and good masters, to the amount of four hundred pounds.

Good night! I have nothing more to tell you, but that I have
lately seen a Sir William Boothby, who saw you about a year
ago, and adores you, as all the English you receive ought to
do.  He is much in my favour.

To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 15, 1750.

The High-bailiff, after commending himself and his own
impartiality for an hour this morning, not unlike your cousin
Pelham, has declared Lord Trentham.  The mob declare they will
pull his house down to show their impartiality.  The Princess
has luckily produced another boy; so Sir George Vandeput may be
recompensed with being godfather.  I stand to-morrow, not for a
member, but for godfather to my sister's girl, with Mrs. Selwyn
and old Dunch: were ever three such dowagers? when shall three
such meet again? If the babe has not a most sentimentally
yellow complexion after such sureties, I will burn my books,
and never answer for another skin.

You have heard, I suppose, that Nugent must answer a little
more seriously for Lady Lymington's child.  Why, she was as
ugly as Mrs. Nugent, had had more children, and was not so
young.  The pleasure of wronging a woman, who had bought him so
dear, could be the only temptation.

Adieu! I have told you all I know, and as much is scandal, very
possibly more than is true.  I go to Strawberry on Saturday,
and so shall not know even scandal.



66 Letter 24
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 19, 1750.

I did not doubt but you would be diverted with the detail of
absurdities that were committed after the earthquake: I could
have filled more paper with such relations, If I had not feared
tiring you.  We have swarmed with sermons, essays, relations,
poems, and exhortations On that subject.  One Stukely, a
parson, has accounted for it, and I think prettily, by
electricity--but that is the fashionable cause, and every thing
is resolved into electrical appearances, as formerly every
thing was accounted for by Descartes's vortices, and Sir
Isaac's gravitation.  But they all take care, after accounting
for the earthquake systematically, to assure you that still it
was nothing less than a judgment.  Dr. Barton, the rector of
St. Andrews, was the only sensible, or at least honest divine,
upon the occasion.  When some women would have had him to pray
to them in his parish church against the intended shock, he
excused himself on having a great cold.  "And besides," said
he, "you may go to St. James's church; the Bishop of Oxford is
to preach there all night about earthquakes."  Turner, a great
china-man, at the corner of Dext street, had a jar cracked by
the shock: he originally asked ten guineas for the pair; he now
asks twenty, "because it is the only jar in Europe that has
been cracked by an earthquake." But I have quite done with this
topic.  The Princess of Wales is lowering the price of princes,
as the earthquake has raised old china; she has produced a
fifth boy.  In a few years we shall have Dukes of York and
Lancaster popping out of bagnios and taverns as frequently as
Duke Hamilton.(140)  George Selwyn said a good thing the other
day on another cheap dignity: he was asked who was playing at
tennis, He replied, "Nobody but three markers and a Regent."
your friend Lord Sandwich.  While we are undervaluing all
principalities and powers, you are making a rout with them, for
which I shall scold you.  We had been diverted with the pompous
accounts of the reception of the Margrave of Baden Dourlach at
Rome; and now you tell me he has been put upon the same foot at
Florence! I never heard his name when he was here, but on his
being mob'd as he was going to Wanstead, and the people's
calling him the Prince of Bad-door-lock.  He was still less
noticed than he of Modena.

Lord Bath is as well received at Paris as a German Margrave in
Italy.  Every body goes to Paris: Lord Mountford was introduced
to the King, who only said brutally enough, "Ma foi! il est
bien nourri!" Lord Albemarle keeps an immense table there, with
sixteen people in his kitchen; his aide-de-camps invite every
body, but he seldom graces the banquet himself, living retired
out of the town with his old Columbine.(141)  What an
extraordinary man! with no fortune at all, and with slight parts,
he has seventeen thousand a year from the government, which he
squanders away, though he has great debts, and four or five
numerous broods of children of one sort or other!

The famous Westminster election is at last determined, and Lord
Trentham returned: the mob were outrageous, and pelted Colonel
Waldegrave, whom they took for Mr. Leveson, from Covent-garden
to the Park, and knocked down Mr. Offley, who was with him.
Lord Harrington(142) was scarce better treated when he went on
board a ship from Dublin.  There are great commotions there
about one Lucas, an apothecary, and favourite of the mob.  The
Lord Lieutenant bought off a Sir Richard Cox, a patriot, by a
place in the revenue, though with great opposition from that
silly mock-virtuoso, Billy
Bristow, and that sillier Frederick Frankland, two oafs, whom
you have seen in Italy, and who are commissioners there.  Here
are great disputes in the Regency, where Lord Harrington finds
there is not spirit enough to discard these puppet-show heroes!

We have got a second volume of Bower'S(143) History of the
Popes, but it is tiresome and pert, and running into a warmth
and partiality that he had much avoided in his first volume.
He has taken such pains to disprove the Pope's supremacy being
acknowledged pretty early, that he has convinced me it was
acknowledged.  Not that you and I care whether it were or not.
He is much admired here; but I am not good Christian enough to
rejoice over him, because turned Protestant; nor honour his
confessorship, when he ran away with the materials that were
trusted to him to write for the papacy, and makes use of them
to write against it.  You know how impartial I am; I can love
him for being shocked at a system of cruelty supporting
nonsense; I can be pleased with the truths he tells; I can and
do admire his style, and his genius in recovering a language
that he forgot by six years old, so well as to excel in writing
it, and yet I wish that all this had happened without any
breach of trust!

Stosch has grievously offended me; but that he will little
regard, as I can be of no use to him: he has sold or given his
charming intaglio of the Gladiator to Lord Duncannon.  I must
reprove you a little who sent it; you know how much I pressed
you to buy it for me, and how much I offered.  I still think it
one of the finest rings(144) I ever saw, and am mortified at not
having it.

Apropos to Bower; Miss Pelham had heard that he had foretold
the return of the earthquake-fit: her father sent for him, to
COnVince her that Bower was too sensible; but had the
precaution to talk to him first: he replied gravely, that a
fire was kindled under the earth, and he could not tell when it
would blaze out.  You may be sure he was not carried to the
girl!  Adieu!

beautiful Miss Gunning.  he died in 1758.-D.

at Douay and Rome, and became a Jesuit.  Having been detected,
as it is said, in an intrigue with a nun, he was forced to fly
from Perugia, where he resided: and after a series of strange
and not very creditable adventures, he arrived in England.
Here he declared himself a Protestant; but, after some years,
wishing to swindle the English Jesuits out of an annuity, be
again returned to their order.  Having got all he could from
them, he again returned to Protestantism, and wrote his
"History of the Popes," which was his principal literary
work.-D. (Gibbon, speaking of Bower, in his Extraits (le mon
Journal for 1764, says, " He is a rogue unmasked, who enjoyed,
for twenty years, the favour of the public, because he had
quitted a sect to which he still secretly adhered; and because
he had been a counsellor of the inquisition in the town of
Macerata, where an inquisition never existed." Bower died in
Bond Street, in September, 1766, in his eighty-first year, and
was buried in Mary-le-bone churchyard, where there is a
monument to his memory.]

68 Letter 25
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, June 23, 1750.

Dear George,
As I am not Vanneck'd(145) I have been in no hurry to thank you
for your congratulation, and to assure you that I never knew
what solid happiness was till I was married.  Your Trevors and
Rices dined with me last week at Strawberry Hill, and would
have had me answer you upon the matrimonial tone, but I thought
I should imitate cheerfulness in that style as ill as if I were
really married.  I have had another of your friends with me
here some time, whom I adore, Mr. Bentley; he has more sense,
judgment, and wit, more taste, and more misfortunes, than sure
ever met in any man.  I have heard that Dr. Bentley, regretting
his want of taste for all such learning as his, which is the
very want of taste, used to sigh and say, "Tully had his
Marcus." If the sons resembled as much as the fathers did, at
least in vanity, I would be the modest agreeable Marquis.  Mr.
Bentley tells me that you press him much to visit you at
Hawkhurst.  I advise him, and assure him he will make his
fortune under you there; that you are an agent from the board
of trade to the smugglers, and wallow in contraband wine, tea,
and silk handkerchiefs.  I found an old newspaper t'other day,
with a list of outlawed smugglers; there were John Price, alias
Miss Marjoram, Bob Plunder, Bricklayer Tom, and Robin
Cursemother, all of Hawkhurst, in Kent.  When Miss Harriet is
thoroughly hardened at Buxton, as I hear she is being,, in a
public room with the whole Wells, from drinking waters, I
conclude she will come to sip nothing but new brandy.

As jolly and as abominable a life as she may have been leading,
I defy all her enormities to equal a party of pleasure that I
had t'other night.  I shall relate it to you to show you the
manners of the age, which are always as entertaining to a
person fifty miles off, as to one born an hundred and fifty
years after the time.  I had a card from Lady Caroline
Petersham to go with her to Vauxhall.  I went accordingly to her
house, and found her and the little Ashe,(146) or the Pollard
Ashe, as they call her; they had just finished their last layer
of red, and looked as handsome as crimson could make them.  On
the cabinet-door stood a pair of Dresden candlesticks, a present
from the virgin hands of Sir John Bland: the branches of each
formed  a little bower over a cock and hen * * * *  We issued
into the mall to assemble our company, which was all the town, if
we could get it; for just so many had been summoned, except Harry
Vane(147) whom we met by chance.  We mustered the Duke of
Kingston, whom Lady Caroline says she has been trying for these
seven years; but alas! his beauty is at the fall of the leaf;
Lord March,(148) Mr. Whitehead, a pretty Miss Beauclerc, and a
very foolish Miss Sparre.  These two damsels were trusted by
their mothers for the first time of their lives to the matronly
care of Lady Caroline.  As we sailed up the mall with all our
colours flying, Lord Petersham,(149) with his hose and legs
twisted to every point of crossness, strode by us on the outside,
and repassed again on the return.  At the end of' the mall she
called to him; he would not answer: she gave a familiar spring
and, between laugh and confusion, ran up to him, "My lord! my
lord! why, you don't see us!"  We advanced at a little
distance, not a little awkward in expectation how all this
would end, for my lord never stirred his hat, or took the least
notice of any body; she said, "Do you go with us, or are you
going any where else?"--"I don't go with you, I am going
somewhere else;" and away he stalked. as sulky as a ghost that
nobody will speak to first.  We got into the best order we
could, and marched to our barge,  with a boat of French horns
attending, and little Ashe singing.  We paraded some time up
the river, and at last debarked at Vauxhall - there, if we had
so pleased, we might have had the vivacity of our party
increased by a quarrel; for a Mrs.  Loyd,(150)Who is supposed
to be married to Lord Haddington, seeing the two girls
following Lady Petersham and Miss Ashe, said aloud, "Poor
girls, I am sorry to see them in such bad company!"  Miss
Sparre, who desired nothing so much as the fun of seeing a
duel,--a thing which, though she is fifteen, she has never been
so lucky to see,--took due pains to make Lord March resent
this; but he, who is very lively and agreeable, laughed her out
of this charming frolic with a great deal of humour.  Here we
picked up Lord Granby, arrived very drunk from Jenny's
Whim;(151) where, instead of going to old Strafford's(152)
catacombs to make honourable love, he had dined with Lady
Fanny,(153) and left her and eight other women and
four other men playing at brag.  He would fain have made over
his honourable love upon any terms to poor Miss Beauclerc, who
is very modest, and did not know at all what to do with his
whispers or his hands.  He then addressed himself to the
Sparre, who was very well disposed to receive both; but the
tide of champagne turned, he hiccupped at the reflection of his
marriage (of which he is wondrous sick), and only proposed to
the girl to shut themselves up and rail at the world for three
weeks.  If all the adventures don't conclude as you expect in
the beginning of a paragraph, you must not wonder, for I am not
making a history, but relating one strictly as it happened, and
I think with full entertainment enough to content you.  At
last, we assembled in our booth, Lady Caroline in the front,
with the vizor of her hat erect, and looking gloriously jolly
and handsome.  She had fetched my brother Orford from the next
box, where he was enjoying himself with his petite partie, to
help us to mince chickens.  We minced seven chickens into a
china dish, which Lady Caroline stewed over a lamp with three
pats of butter and a flagon of water, stirring and rattling,
and laughing, and we every minute expecting to have the dish
fly about our ears.  She had brought Betty, the fruit-girl,
with hampers of strawberries and cherries from Rogers's, and
made her wait upon us, and then made her sup by us at a little
table.  The conversation was no less lively than the whole
transaction.  There was a Mr. O'Brien arrived from Ireland, who
would get the Duchess of Manchester from Mr. Hussey, if she
were still at liberty.  I took up the biggest hautboy in the
dish, and said to Lady Caroline, "Madam, Miss Ashe desires you
would eat this O'Brien strawberry:" she replied immediately, "I
won't, you hussey."  You may imagine the laugh this reply
occasioned.  After the tempest was a little calmed, the Pollard
said, "Now, how any body would spoil this story that was to
repeat it, and say, "I won't, you jade!"  In short, the whole
air of our party was sufficient, as you will easily imagine, to
take up the whole attention of the garden; so much so, that
from eleven o'clock till half an hour after one we had the
whole concourse round our booth: at last, they came into the
little gardens of each booth on the sides of ours, till Harry
Vane took up a bumper, and drank their healths, and was
proceeding to treat them with still greater freedom.  It was
three o'clock before we got home.  I think I have told you the
chief passages.  Lord Granby's temper had been a little ruffled
the night before; the Prince had invited him and Dick Lyttelton
to Kew, where he won eleven hundred pounds of the latter, and
eight of the former, then cut and told them @e would play with
them no longer, for he saw they played so idly, that they were
capable of "losing more than they would like."  Adieu! I expect
in return for this long tale that you will tell me some of your
frolics with Robin Cursemother, and some of Miss
Marjoram's bon-mots.

P. S. Dr. Middleton called on me yesterday: he is come to town
to consult his physician for a jaundice and swelled legs,
symptoms which, the doctor tells him, and which he believes,
can be easily cured: I think him visibly broke, and near his
end.(154)  He lately advised me to marry, on the sense of his
own happiness; but if any body had advised him to the contrary,
at his time of life,(155) I believe he would not have broke so
soon.

him will say they have killed him; but by what Mr. Yorke told
me, his bricklayer will dispute the honour of his death with
them.',-E.

a Bristol merchant.  On making her a matrimonial visit, Bishop
Gooch told Mrs. Middleton that ,he was glad she did not dislike

she hoped his lordship did not reckon her husband among the
Ancients yet." The Bishop answered, "You, Madam, are the best
judge of that" Nichols's literary Anecdotes, Vol. v. p. 422.-E.



71 Letter 26
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 25, 1750.

I told YOU my idle season was coming on, and that I should have
great intervals between my letters; have not I kept my word?
For any thing I have to tell you, I might have kept it a month
longer.  I came out of Essex last night, and find the town
quite depopulated: I leave it to-morrow, and go to Mr.
Conway's(156) in Buckinghamshire, with only giving a transient
glance on Strawberry Hill.  Don't imagine I am grown fickle; I
thrust all my visits into a heap, and then am quiet for the
rest of the season.  It is so much the way in England to jaunt
about, that one can't avoid it; but it convinces me that people
are more tired of themselves and the country than they care to
own.

Has your brother told you that my Lord Chesterfield has bought
the Houghton lantern? the famous lantern, that produced so much
patriot Wit;(157) and very likely some of his lordship's? My
brother had bought a much handsomer at Lord Cholmondeley's
sale; for, with all the immensity of the celebrated one, it was
ugly, and too little for the hall.  He would have given it to
Lord Chesterfield rather than he should not have had it.

You tell us nothing of your big events, of the quarrel of the
Pope and the Venetians, on the Patriarchate of Aquileia.  We
look upon it as so decisive that I should not wonder if Mr.
Lyttelton, or Whitfield the Methodist, were to set out for
Venice, to make them a tender of some of our religions.

Is it true too what we hear, that the Emperor has turned the
tables on her Caesarean jealousy,(158) and discarded Metastasio
the poet, and that the latter is gone mad upon it, instead of
hugging himself on coming off so much better than his
predecessor in royal love and music, David Rizzio?  I believe I
told you that one of your sovereigns, and an intimate friend of
yours, King Theodore, is in the King's Bench prison.  I have so
little to say, that I don't care if I do tell you the same
thing twice.  He lived in a privileged place; his creditors
seized him by making him believe lord Granville wanted him on
business of importance; he bit at it, and concluded they were
both to be reinstated at once.  I have desired Hogarth to go
and steal his picture for me; though I suppose one might easily
buy a sitting of him.  The King of Portugal (and when I have
told you this, I have done with kings) has bought a handsome
house here,(159) for the residence of his ministers.

I believe you have often heard me mention a Mr. Ashton,(160) a
clergyman, who, in one word, has great preferments, and owes
every thing upon earth to me.  I have long had reason to
complain of his behaviour; in short, my father is dead, and I
can make no bishops.  He has at last quite thrown off the mask,
and in the most direct manner, against my will, has written
against my friend Dr. Middleton,(161) taking for his motto
these lines,

"Nullius addictus jurare in verba Magistri,
Quid verum atque decens curo et rogo, et omnis in hoc sum".


I have forbid him my house, and wrote this paraphrase upon his
picture,

"Nullius addictus munus meminisse Patroni,
Quid vacat et qui dat, curo et rogo, et omnis in hoc sum."

I own it was pleasant to me the other day, on meeting Mr.
Tonson, his bookseller, at the Speaker's, and asking him if he
had sold many of Mr. Ashton's books, to be told, "Very few
indeed, Sir!"

I beg you will thank Dr. Cocchi much for his book; I will thank
him much more when I have received and read it.  His friend,
Dr. Mead, is undone; his fine collection is going to be sold:
he owes about five-and-twenty thousand Pounds.  All the world
thought himimmensely  rich; but, besides the expense of his
collection, he kept a table for which alone he is said to have
allowed seventy pounds a-week.


(156)  Mr. Conway had hired Latimers, in Buckinghamshire, for
three years.

(157) In one pamphlet, the noise of this lantern, was so
exaggerated, that the author said, on a journey to Houghton, he
was first carried into a glass-room, which he supposed was the
porter's lodge, but proved to be the lantern. [This lantern,
which hung from the ceiling of the hall, was for eighteen
candles, and of copper gilt.  It was the Craftsman which made
so much noise about it.]

73 Letter 27
To sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, August 2, 1750.

I had just sent my letter to the '@Secretary's office the other
day, when I received yours: it would have prevented my
reproving you for not mentioning the quarrel between the Pope
and the Venetians; and I should have had time to tell you that
Dr. Mead's bankruptcy is contradicted.  I don't love to send
you falsities, so I tell you this is contradicted, though it is
by no means clear that he is not undone-he is scarce worth
making an article in two letters.

I don't wonder that Marquis Acciaudi's villa did not answer to
you; by what I saw in Tuscany, and by the prints, their villas
are strangely out of taste, and laboured by their unnatural
regularity and art to destroy the romanticness of the
situations.  I wish you could see the villas and seats here!
the country wears a new face; every body is improving their
places, and as they don't fortify, their plantations with
intrenchments of walls and high hedges, one has the benefit of
them even in passing by.  The dispersed buildings, I mean
temples, bridges, etc. are generally Gothic or Chinese, and
give a whimsical air of novelty that is very pleasing.  You
would like a drawing-room in the latter style that I fancied
and have been executing at Mr. Rigby's, in Essex.  it has large
and Very fine Indian landscapes, with a black fret round them,
and round the whole entablature of the room, and all the ground
or hanging is of pink paper.  While I was there, we had eight
of the hottest days that ever were felt; they say, some degrees
beyond the hottest in the East Indies, and that the Thames was
more so than the hot well at Bristol.  The guards died )n their
posts at Versailles: and here a captain Halyburton,
brother-in-law of lord Moncton, went mad with the excess

Your brother Gal. will, I suppose, be soon making improvements
like the rest of the world: he has bought an estate in Kent,
called Bocton Malherbe, famous enough for having belonged to
two men who, in my opinion, have very little title to fame, Sir
Harry Wotton and my lord Chesterfield.  I must have the
pleasure of being the first to tell you that your pedigree is
finished at last; a most magnificent performance, and that will
make a pompous figure in a future great hall at Bocton Malherbe
when your great nephews or great-grandchildren shall be Earls,
etc.  My cousin Lord Conway is made Earl of Hertford, as a
branch of the somersets: Sir Edward Seymour gave his
approbation handsomely.  He has not yet got the dukedom
himself, as there is started up a Dr. Seymour who claims it,
but will be able to make nothing out.

Dr. Middleton is dead--not killed by Mr. Ashton--but of a decay
that came Upon him at once.  The Bishop of London(162) will
perhaps make a jubilee(163) for his death, and then We shall
draw off some Of your crowds of travellers.  Tacitus
Gordon(164) died the same day; he married the widow of
Trenchard(165) (with whom he wrote Cato's letters,) at the same
time that Dr. Middleton married her companion.  The Bishop of
Durham (Chandler),(166) another great writer of controversy, is
dead too, immensely rich; he is succeeded by Butler(167) of
Bristol, a metaphysic author, much patronized by the late
Queen; she never could make my father read his book, and -which
she Certainly did not understand herself: he told her his
religion was fixed, and that he did not want to change Or
improve it.  A report is come of the death of the King of
Portugal, and of the young Pretender; but that I don't believe.

I have been in town for a day or two, and heard no conversation
but about M'Lean, a fashionable highwayman, who is just taken,
and who robbed me among others; as Lord Eglinton, Sir Thomas
Robinson, Of Vienna, Mrs. Talbot, etc.  He took an odd booty
from the Scotch Earl, a blunderbuss, which lies very formidably
upon the justice's table.  He was taken by selling a laced
waistcoat to a pawnbroker, who happened to carry it to the very
man who had just sold the lace. His history is very Particular,
for he confesses every thing, and is so little of a hero that
he cries and begs, and I believe, if Lord Eglinton had been in
any luck, might have been robbed of his own blunderbuss.  His
father was an Irish Dean; his brother is a Calvinist minister
in great esteem at the Hague.  He himself was a grocer, but
losing a wife that he loved extremely about two years ago, and
by whom he has one little girl, he quitted his business with
two hundred pounds in his pocket, which he soon spent, and then
took to the road with only one companion, Plunket, a journeyman
apothecary, my other friend, whom he has impeached, but who is
not taken.  M'Lean had a lodging in St. James's Street, over
against White's, and another at Chelsea; Plunket one in Jermyn
Street; and their faces are as known about St. James's as any
gentleman's who lives in that quarter, and who perhaps goes upon
the road too.  M'Lean had a quarrel at Putney bowling-green two
months ago with an officer, whom he challenged for disputing his
rank; but the captain declined, till M'Lean should produce a
certificate of his nobility, which he has just received.  If he
had escaped a month longer, he might have heard of Mr. Chute's
genealogic expertness, and come hither to the college of Arms for
a certificate.  There was a wardrobe of clothes, three-and-twenty
purses, and the celebrated blunderbuss found at his lodgings,
besides a famous kept mistress.  As I conclude he will suffer,
and wish him no ill, I don't care to have his idea, and am
almost single in not having been to see him.  Lord Mountford,
at the head of half White's, went the first day - his aunt was
crying over him: as soon as they were withdrawn, she said to
him, knowing they were of White's, "My dear, what did the lords
say to you?  have you ever been concerned with any of
them?"-Was not that admirable? what a favourable idea people
must have of White's!--and what if White's should not deserve a
much better! But the chief personages who have been to comfort
and weep over this fallen hero are Lady Caroline Petersham and
Miss Ashe: I call them Polly and Lucy, and asked them if he did
not sing

Thus I stand like the Turk with his doxies around."(168)

Another celebrated Polly has been arrested for thirty pounds,
even old Cuzzoni.(169)  The Prince Of Wales bailed her--who
will do as much for him?

I am much obliged to you for your intended civilities to my
liking Madame Capello; but as I never liked any thing of her,
but her prettiness, for she is an idiot, I beg you will
dispense with them on my account: I should even be against your
renewing your garden assemblies.  you would be too good to
pardon the impertinence of the Florentines, and would very
likely expose yourself to more: besides, the absurdities which
English travelling boys are capable of, and likely to act or
conceive, always gave me apprehensions of your meeting with
disagreeable scenes-and then there is another animal still more
absurd than Florentine men or English boys, and that is,
travelling governors, who are mischievous into the bargain, and
whose pride is always hurt because they are sure of its never
being indulged: they will not learn the world, because they are
sent to teach it, and as they come forth more ignorant of it
than their pupils, take care to return with more prejudices,
and as much care to instil all theirs into their pupils.  Don't
assemble them!

Since I began my letter, the King of Portugal's death is
contradicted: for the future, I will be as circumspect as one
of your Tuscan residents was, who being here in Oliver's time,
wrote to his court, "Some say the Protector is dead; others that
he is not: for my part, I believe neither one nor t'other."

Will u send me some excellent melon seeds? I have a neighbour
who shines in fruit, and have promised to get him some:
Zatte`e, I think he says, is a particular sort.  I don't know
the best season for sending them, but you do, and will oblige
me by some of the best sorts.

I suppose you know all that execrable history that occasioned
an insurrection lately at Paris, where they were taking up
young children to try to people one of their colonies, in which
grown persons could never live.  You have seen too, to be sure,
in the papers the bustle that has been all this winter about
purloining some of our manufacturers to Spain.  I was told
to-day that the informations, if they had had rope given them,
would have reached to General Wall.(170)  Can you wonder?  Why
should Spain prefer a native of England(171) to her own
subjects, but because he could and would do us more hurt than a
Spaniard could?  a grandee is a more harmless animal by far
than an Irish Papist.  We stifled this evidence: we are in
their power; We forgot at the last peace to renew the most
material treaty!  Adieu!  You would not forget a material
treaty.

state to King William the Third, was born in 1669.  He wrote
various political pamphlets of a democratic cast.  In 1720 he
published, in conjunction with Thomas Gordon, @ a series of
political letters, under the signature of "Cato."  They
appeared at first in the " London Journal," and afterwards in
the "British Journal," two newspapers of the day.  They
obtained great celebrity, as well from the merit of their
composition, as from -the boldness of the principles they
advocated.  These consisted in an uncompromising hostility to
the Government and to the Church.  Trenchard was member of
parliament for Taunton, and died in 1723.-D.

high office of minister for foreign affairs.]



76 Letter 28
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Sept. 1, 1750.

Here, my dear child, I have two letters of yours to answer.  I
will go answer them; and then, if I have any thing to tell you,
I will.  I accept very thankfully all the civilities you showed
to Madame Capello on my account, but don't accept her on my
account: I don't know who has told you that I liked her, but
you may believe me, I never did.  For the Damers,(172)they have
lived much in the same world that I do.  He is moderately
sensible, immoderately proud, self-sufficient, and whimsical.
She is very sensible, has even humour, if the excessive reserve
and silence that she draws from both father and mother -would
let her, I may almost say, ever show it.  You say, "What people
do we send you!" I reply, "What people we do not send you!"
Those that travel are reasonable, compared with those who can
never prevail on themselves to stir beyond the atmosphere of
their own whims.  I am convinced that the Opinions I give you
about several people must appear very misanthropic; but yet,
you see, are generally forced to own at last that I did not speak
from prejudice - but I won't triumph, since you own that I was in
the right about the Barrets.  I was a little peevish with 'you
in your last, when I came to the paragraph where you begin to
say "I have made use of all the Interest I have with Mr.
Pelham."(173) I concluded you was proceeding to say, "to
procure your arrears;" instead of that, it was to make him
serve Mr. Milbank--will you never have done obliging people?
do begin to think of being obliged.  I dare say Mr. Milbank is
a very pretty sort of man, very sensible of your attentions,
and who will never forget them-till he is past the Giogo.(174)
You recommend him to me: to show you that I have not naturally
an inclination to hate people, I am determined not to be
acquainted with him, that I may not hate him for forgetting
you.  Mr. Pelham will be a little surprised at not finding his
sister(175) at Hanover.  That was all a pretence of his wise
relations here, who grew uneasy that he was happy in a way that
they had not laid out for him: Mrs. Temple is in Sussex.  They
looked upon the pleasure of an amour of choice as a transient
affair; so, to Make his satisfaction permanent, they propose to
marry him, and to a girl(176) he scarce ever saw!

I suppose you have heard all the exorbitant demands of the
heralds for your pedigree! I have seen one this morning,
infinitely richer and better done, which will not cost more; it
is for my Lady Pomfret.  You would be entertained with all her
imagination in it.  She and my lord both descend from Edward
the First, by his two Queens.  The pedigree is painted in a
book: instead of a vulgar genealogical tree, she has devised a
pine-apple plant, sprouting out of a basket, on which is King
Edward's head; on the other leaves are all the intermediate
arms; the fruit is sliced open, and discovers the busts of the
Earl and Countess, from whence issue their issue!  I have had
the old Vere pedigree lately In my hands, which derives that
house from Lucius Verus; but I am now grown to bear no descent
but my Lord Chesterfield's, who has placed among the portraits
of his ancestors two old heads, inscribed Adam de Stanhope and
Eve de Stanhope; the ridicule is admirable.  Old Peter Leneve,
the herald, who thought ridicule consisted in not being of an
old family, made this epitaph, and it was a good one, for young
Craggs, whose father had been a footman, "Here lies the last
who died before the first of his family!"  Pray mind,
how I string old stories together to-day.  This old
Craggs,(177) who was angry with Arthur More, who had worn a 78
livery too, and who was getting into a coach with him, turned
about and said, "Why, Arthur, I am always going to get up
behind; are not you!"  I told this story the other day to
George Selwyn, whose passion is to see coffins and corpses, and
executions: he replied, "that Arthur More had had his coffin
chained to that of his mistress."--"Lord!" said I, "how do you
know!"--"Why, I saw them the other day in a vault at St.
Giles's." He was walking this week in Westminster Abbey with
Lord Abergavenny, and met the man who shows the tombs, "Oh!
your servant, Mr. Selwyn; I expected to have seen you here the
other day, when the old Duke of Richmond's body was taken up."
Shall I tell you another story of George Selwyn before I tap
the chapter of Richmond, which you see opens here very apropos?
With this strange and dismal turn, he has infinite fun and
humour in him.  He went lately on a party of pleasure to see
places with Lord Abergavenny and a pretty Mrs. Frere, who love
one another a little.  At Cornbury there are portraits of all
the royalists and regicides, and illustrious headless.(178)
Mrs. Frere ran about, looked at nothing, let him look at
nothing, screamed about Indian paper, and hurried over all the
rest.  George grew peevish, called her back, told her it was
monstrous. when he had come so far with her, to let him see
nothing; "And you are a fool, you don't know what you missed in
the other room."--"Why, what?"--"Why, my Lord Holland'S(179)
picture."--"Well! what is my Lord Holland to me?"--"Why, do you
know," said he, ,that my Lord Holland's body lies in the same
vault in Kensington church with my Lord Abergavenny's mother?"
Lord! she 'was so obliged, and thanked him a thousand times.

The Duke of Richmond is dead, vastly lamented: the Duchess is
left in great circumstances.  Lord Albemarle, Lord Lincoln, the
Duke of Marlborough, Duke of Leeds, and the Duke of Rutland,
are talked of for master of the horse.  The first is likeliest
to succeed; the Pelhams wish most to have the last: you know he
is Lady Catherine's brother, and at present attached to the
Prince.  His son Lord Granby's match, which is at last to be
finished to-morrow, has been a mighty topic of conversation
lately.  The bride is one of the great heiresses of old proud
Somerset.  Lord Winchilsea, who is her uncle, and who has married
the other sister very loosely to his own
relation, Lord Guernsey, has tied up Lord Granby so rigorously
that the Duke of Rutland has endeavoured to break the match.
She has four thousand pounds a year: he is said to have the
same in present, but not to touch hers.  He is in debt ten
thousand pounds.  She was to give him ten, which now Lord
Winchilsea refuses.  Upon the strength of her fortune, Lord
Granby proposed to treat her with presents of twelve thousand
pounds; but desired her to buy them.  She, who never saw nor
knew the value of ten shillings while her father lived, and has
had no time to learn it, bespoke away so roundly, that for one
article of the plate she ordered ten sauceboats: besides this,
she and her sister have squandered seven thousand pounds apiece
in all kind of baubles and frippery; so her four thousand
pounds a-year is to be set apart for two years to pay her
debts.  Don't you like this English management? two of the
greatest fortunes meeting and setting out with poverty and
want!  Sir Thomas Bootle, the Prince's chancellor, who is one
of the guardians, wanted to have her tradesmen's bills taxed;
but in the mean time he has wanted to marry her Duchess-mother:
his love-letter has been copied and dispersed every where.  To
give you a sufficient instance of his absurdity, the first time
he went with the Prince of Wales to Cliefden, he made a
nightgown, cap, and slippers of gold brocade, in which he came
down to breakfast the next morning.

My friend M'Lean is still the fashion: have not I reason to
call him my friend?  He says, if the pistol had shot me, he had
another for himself.  Can I do less than say I will be hanged
if he is?  They have made a print, a very dull one, of what I
think I said to Lady Caroline Petersham about him,

,Thus I stand like the Turk with his doxies around!"

You have seen in the papers a Hanoverian duel, but may be you
don't know that it was an affair of jealousy.  Swiegel, the
slain, was here two years ago, and paid his court so
Assiduously to the Countess(180) that it was intimated to him
to return; and the summer we went thither afterwards, he was
advised to stay at his villa.  Since that, he has grown more
discreet and a favourite.  Freychappel came hither lately, was
proclaimed a beauty by the monarch, and to return the
compliment, made a tender of all his charms where Swiegel had.
the latter recollected his own passion Jostled Freychappel,
fought, and was killed.  I am glad he never heard what poor
Gibberne was intended for.

They have put in the papers a good story made on White's: a
man dropped down dead at the door, was carried in: the club
immediately made bets whether he was dead or not, and when they
were going to bleed him, the wagerers for his death interposed,
and said it would affect the fairness of the bet.

Mr. Whithed has been so unlucky as to have a large part of his
seat,(181) which he had just repaired, burnt down: it is a
great disappointment to me, too, who was going thither
Gothicizing.  I want an act of parliament to make
master-builders liable to pay for any damage occasioned by fire
before their workmen have quitted it.  Adieu!  This I call a
very gossiping letter; I wish you don't call it worse.

(172) Joseph Damer, afterwards created Lord Milton in Ireland,
married Lady Caroline Sackville, daughter of Lionel, Duke of
Dorset.

(173) Thomas Pelham, of Stanmer; a young gentleman who
travelled with Mr. Milbank.

(174) The highest part of the Apennine between Florence and
Bologna.

(175) Mrs. Temple, widow of Lord Palmerston's son: she was
afterwards married to Lord Abergavenny.

(176) Frances, second daughter of Henry Pelham, chancellor of
the exchequer.  Mr. Thomas Pelham married Miss Frankland.

(177) The two Craggs, father and son, were successively members
of the administration during the reign of George the First, in
the post of secretary of state.  The father died in 1718, and
the son in 1720; and Pope consecrated a beautiful epitaph to
the memory of the latter.  They are both supposed to have been
deeply implicated in the iniquities of the South Sea bubble.-D.

(178) This was the celebrated collection of portraits,
principally by Vandyck, which Lord Dartmouth, in his notes on
Burnet, distinctly accuses the Lord Chancellor Clarendon of
having obtained by rapacious and corrupt means; that is, as
bribes from the "old rebels," who had plundered them from the
houses of the royalists, and who, at the Restoration, found it
necessary to make fair weather with the ruling powers.  The
extensive and miscellaneous nature of the collection (now
divided between Bothwell Castle, in Scotland, and The Grove, in
Hertfordshire) very strongly confirms this accusation.  An
additional confirmation is to be found in a letter of Walpole,
addressed to Richard Bentley, Esq. and dated Sept. 1753, in
which he says, "At Burford I saw the house of Mr. Lenthal, the
descendant of the Speaker.  The front is good; and a chapel,
connected by two or three arches, which let the garden appear
through, has a pretty effect; but the inside of the mansion is
bad, and ill-furnished.  Except a famous picture of Sir Thomas
More's family, the portraits are rubbish, though celebrated.  I
am told that the Speaker, who really had a fine collection,
made his peace by presenting them to Cornbury, where they were
well known, till the Duke of Marlborough bought that seat."-D.

(179) Henry Rich, Earl of Holland, the favourite of Queen
Henrietta Maria.-D.

180) Lady Yarmouth.

(181) Southwick, in Hampshire.



80 Letter 29
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 10, 1750.

You must not pretend to be concerned at having missed one here,
when I had repeatedly begged you, to let me know what day you
would call; and even after you had learnt that I was to come
the next day, you paraded by my house with all your matrimonial
streamers flying, without even saluting the future castle.  To
punish this slight, I shall accept your offer of a visit on the
return of your progress; I shall be here, and Mrs. leneve will
not.

I feel for the poor Handasyde.(182)  If I wanted examples for
to deter one from making all the world happy, from obliging,
from being always in good-humour and spirits, she should be my
memento.  You find long wise faces every day, that tell you
riches cannot make one happy.  No, can't they? What pleasantry
is that poor woman fallen from! and what a joyous feel must
Vanneck(183) have expired in, Who could call and think the two
Schutzes his friends, and leave five hundred pounds apiece to
their friendship-. nay, riches made him so happy, that, in the
overflowing of his satisfaction, he has bequeathed a hundred
pounds apiece to eighteen fellows, whom he calls his good
friends, that favoured him with their company on Fridays.  He
took it mighty kind that Captain James de Normandie, and twenty
such names, that came out of the Minories, would constrain
themselves to live upon him once a week.

I should like to visit the castles and groves of your old Welsh
ancestors with you: by the draughts I have seen, I have always
imagined that Wales preserved the greatest remains of ancient
days, and have often wished to visit Picton Castle, the seat of
my Philipps-progenitors.

Make my best compliments to your sisters, and with their leave
make haste to this side of the world; you will be extremely
welcome hither as soon and for as long as you like; I can
promise you nothing very agreeable, but that I will try to get
our favourite Mr. Bentley to meet you.  Adieu!

(182) The widow of Brigadier-General Handasyde.-E.

(183) The legacies bequeathed by Gerard Vanneck amounted
altogether to more than a hundred thousand pounds.  The residue
of his property he left to his brother, Joshua Vanneck,
ancestor of Lord Huntingfield.-E.



81 Letter 30
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, September 20, 1750.

I only write you a line to answer some of your questions, and
to tell you that I can't answer others.

I have inquired much about Dr. Mead, but can't tell you any
thing determinately: his family positively deny the foundation
of the reports, but every body does 'not believe their
evidence.  Your brother is positive that there is much of truth
in his being undone, and even that there will be a sale of his
collection(184) when the town comes to town.  I wish for Dr.
Cocchi's sake it be false.  I have given your brother
Middleton's last piece to send you.  Another fellow of
Eton(185) has popped out a sermon against the Doctor since his
death, with a note to one of the pages, that is the true
sublime of ecclesiastic absurdity.  He is speaking against the
custom of dividing the Bible into chapters and verses, and says
it often encumbers the sense.  This note, though long, I must
transcribe, for it would wrong the author to paraphrase his
nonsense:--"It is to be wished, therefore, I think, that a fair
edition were set forth of the original Scriptures, for the use
of learned men in their closets, in which there should be no
notice, either in text or margin, of chapter, or verse, or
paragraph, or any such arbitrary distinctions, (now mind,) and
I might go so far as to say even any pointing or stops.  It
could not but be matter of much satisfaction, and much use, to
have it in our power to recur occasionally to such an edition,
where the understanding might have full range, free from any
external influence from the eye, and the continual danger of
being either confined or misguided by it."  Well, Dr. Cocchi,
do English divines yield to the Romish for refinements in
absurdity! did one ever hear of a better way (if making sense
of any writing than by reading it without stops!  Most of the
parsons that read the first and second lessons practise Mr.
Cooke's method of making them intelligible, for they seldom
observe any stops.  George Selwyn proposes to send the man his
own sermon, and desire him to scratch out the stops, in order
to help it to some sense.

For the questions in Florentine politics, and who are to be
your governors, I am totally ignorant, you must ask Sir Charles
Williams; he is the present ruling star of our negotiations.
His letters are as much admired as ever his verses were.  He
has met the ministers of the two angry empresses, and pacified
Russian savageness and Austrian haughtiness.  He is to teach
the monarch of Prussia to fetch and carry, .@;, unless they
happen to treat in iambics, or begin to settle the limits of'
Parnassus instead of' those of Silesia.  As he is so good a
pacifier, I don't know but we may want his assistance at home
before the end of the winter:

"With secretaries, secretaries jar,
And rival bureaus threat approaching war."

Those that deal in elections look still higher, and snuff a new
Parliament; but I don't believe the King ill, for the Prince is
building baby-houses at Kew; and the Bishop of Oxford has laid
aside his views on Canterbury, and is come roundly back to St.
James's for the deanery of St. Paul's.(186)  I could not help
being diverted the other day with the life of another Bishop of
Oxford, one Parker, who, like Secker, set out a Presbyterian,
and died King James the Second's arbitrary master of Maudlin
College.(187)

M'Lean is condemned, and will hang.  I am honourably mentioned
in a Grub-street ballad for not having contributed to his
sentence.  There are as many prints and pamphlets about him as
about the earthquake.  His profession grows no joke: I was
sitting in my own dining-room on Sunday night, the clock had
not struck eleven, when I heard a loud cry of "Stop thief!" a
highwayman had attacked a postchaise in Picadilly, within fifty
yards of this house: the fellow was pursued, rode over the
watchman, almost killed him, and escaped.  I expect to be
robbed some night in my own garden at Strawberry; I have a pond
of gold fish, that to be sure they will steal to burn like old
lace; and they may very easily, for the springs are so much
sunk with this hot summer that I am forced to water my pond
once a week!  The season is still so fine, that I yesterday, in
Kensington town, saw a horse-chestnut tree in second bloom.

As I am in town, and not within the circle of Pope's walks, I
may tell you a story without fearing he should haunt me with
the ghost of a satire.  I went the other day to see little
Spence,(188) who fondles an old mother in imitation of Pope.
The good old woman was mighty civil to me, and, among other
chat, said she supposed I had a good neighbour in Mr. Pope.
"Lord! Madam, he has been dead these seven years!"--"Ah! ay,
Sir, I had forgot."  When the poor old soul dies, how Pope will
set his mother's spectre upon her for daring to be ignorant "if
Dennis be alive or dead!"(189)

(184) His collection was not sold till after his death, in the
years 1754 and 1755.

(185) William Cooke.

(186) Dr. Secker.  In November he was appointed to the said
deanery.-E.

(187) There is the following entry in Evelyn's Diary for March
23, 1687-8: "Dr. Parker, Bishop of Oxford, who so lately
published his extraordinary treatise about transubstantiation,
and for abrogating the test and penal laws, died.  He was
esteemed a violent, passionate, haughty man; but yet being
pressed to declare for the church of Rome, he utterly refused
it.  A remarkable end."-E.

(188) The Rev. Joseph Spence, author of an Essay on Pope's
Odyssey, Polymetus, etc.  See vol. i. pp. 27, 65.  (He was
always strongly attached to his mother.  When on his travels,
in 1739, he thus wrote to her:--"I am for happiness in my own
way, and according to my notions of it, I might as well, and
better, have it in living with you, at our cottage in
Birchanger, than in any palace.  As my affairs stand at
present, 'tis likely that we shall have enough to live quite at
our ease: when I desire more than that, may I lose what I
have!"-E.)

83 Letter 31
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Oct. 18, 1750.

I had determined so seriously to write to Dr. Cocchi a letter
myself to thank him for his Baths of Pisa, that it was
impossible not to break my resolution.  It was to be in
Italian, because I thought their superlative issimos would most
easily express how much I like it, and I had already gathered a
tolerable quantity together, of entertaining, charming, useful,
agreeable, and had cut and turned them into the best sounding!
Tuscan adjectives I could find in my memory or my Crusca:  but,
alack! when I came to range them, they did not fadge at all;
they neither expressed what I would say, nor half what I would
say, and so I gave it all up, and am reduced to beg you would
say it all for me; and make as many excuses and as many thanks
for me as you can, between your receiving this, and your next
going to bully Richcourt, or whisper Count Lorenzi.  I laughed
vastly at your idea of the latter's hopping into matrimony; and
I like as much Stainville's jumping into Richcourt's place.  If
your pedigree, which is on its journey, arrives before his
fall, he will not dare to exclude YOU from the libro d'oro--
-why, child, you will find yourself as sumptuously descended as

--"All the blood of all the Howards."

or as the best-bred Arabian mare, that ever neighed beneath
Abou-al-eb-saba-bedin-lolo-ab-alnin! But pray now, how does cet
homme l`a, as the Princess used to call him, dare to tap the
chapter of birth!  I thought he had not had a grandfather since
the creation, that was not born within these twenty years!-But
come, I must tell you news, big news!  the treaty of commerce
with Spain is arrived signed.  Nobody expected it would ever
come, which I believe is the reason it is reckoned so good; for
autrement one should not make the most favourable conjectures,
as they don't tell us how good it is.  In general, they say,
the South Sea Company is to have one hundred thousand pounds in
lieu of their annual ship; which, if it is not over and above
the ninety-five thousand pounds that was allowed to be due to
them, it appears to me only as if there were some halfpence
remaining when the bill was paid, and the King of Spain had
given them to the company to drink his health.  What does look
well for the treaty is, that stocks rise to highwater mark; and
what is to me as clear, is, that the exploded Don Benjamin(190)
has repaired what the patriot Lord Sandwich had forgot, or not
known to do at Aix-la-Chapelle.  I conclude Keene will now come
over and enjoy the Sabbath of his toils.  He and Sir Charles are
the plenipotentiaries in fashion.  Pray, brush up your Minyhood
and figure too: blow the coals between the Pope and the
Venetians, till the Inquisition burns the latter, and they the
Inquisition.  If you should happen to receive instructions on
this head, don't wait for St. George's day before you present
your memorial to the Senate, as they say Sir Harry Wotton was
forced to do for St. James's, when those aquatic republicans
had quarrelled with Paul the Fifth, and James the First thought
the best way in the world to broach a schism was by beginning
it with a quibble.  I have had some Protestant hopes too of a
civil war in France, between the King and his clergy: but it is
a dull age, and people don't set about cutting one another's
throats with any spirit!  Robbing is the only thing that goes
on with any vivacity, though my friend Mr. M'Lean is hanged.
The first Sunday after his condemnation, three thousand people
went to see him; he fainted away twice with the heat of his
cell.  You can't conceive the ridiculous rage there is of going
to Newgate; and the prints that are published of the
malefactors, and the memoirs of their lives and deaths set
forth with as much parade as--as--Marshal Turenne's--we have no
General's worth making a parallel.

The pasquinade was a very great one.(191)  When I was desiring
YOU to make speeches for me to Dr. Cocchi, I might as well have
drawn a bill upon you too in Mr. Chute's name: for I am sure he
will never write himself.  Indeed, at present he is in his
brother's purgatory, and then you will not wonder if he does
nothing but pray to get Out of it.  I am glad you are getting
into a villa: my castle will, I believe, begin to rear its
battlements next spring.  I have got an immense cargo of
painted glass from Flanders: indeed, several of the pieces are
Flemish arms; but I call them the achievements of the old
Counts of Strawberry.  Adieu!

(190) Benjamin Keene, afterwards knight of the bath, ambassador
at Madrid, was exceedingly abused by the Opposition in Sir
Robert Walpole's time, under the name of Don Benjamin, for
having made the convention in 1739. [Mr.  Pelham, in a letter
to Mr. Pitt of the 12th of October 1750, announcing the signing
of the treaty with Spain, says, "I hope and believe, when you
see it and consider the whole, you will be of opinion, that my
friend Keene has acted ably, honestly, and bravely; but, poor
man! he is so sore with old bruises, that he still feels the
smart, and fears another thrashing." See Chatham
Correspondence, vol. i. P. 50.)

Venetians.  Marforio asked Pasquin, "Perche si triste?"-

84 letter 32
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 19, 1750.

I stayed to write to you, till I could tell you that I had seen
Mr. Pelham and Mr. Milbank, and could give you some history of
a new administration--but I found it was too long to wait for
either.  I pleaded with your brother as I did with you against
visiting your friends, especially when, to encourage me, he
told me that you had given them a very advantageous opinion of
me.  That is the very reason, says I, why I don't choose to see
them: they will be extremely civil to me at first; and then they
will be told I have horns and hoofs., and they will shun me,
which I should not like.  I know how unpopular I am with the
people with whom they must necessarily live; and, not desiring to
be otherwise, I must either seek your friends where I would most
avoid them, or have them very soon grow to avoid me.  However, I
went and left my name for Mr. Pelham, where your brother told me
he lodged, eight days ago; he was to come but that night to his
lodgings, and by his telling your brother he believed I had not
been, I concluded he would not accept that for a visit; so last
Thursday, I left my name for both--to-day is Monday, and I have
heard nothing of them--very likely I shall before you receive
this--I only mention it to show you that you was in the wrong
and I in the right, to think that there would be no
empressement for an acquaintance.  Indeed, I would not mention
it, as you will dislike being disappointed by any odd behaviour
of your friends, if it were not to justify myself, and convince
you of my attention in complying with whatever you desire of
me.  The King, I hear, commands Mr. Pelham's dancing; and he
must like Mr. Milbank, as he distinguished himself much in a
tournament of bears at Hanover.

For the Ministry, it is all in shatters: the Duke of Newcastle
is returned more averse to the Bedfords than ever: he smothered
that Duke with embraces at their first meeting, and has never
borne to be in the room with him since.  I saw the meeting of
Octavia and Cleopatra;(192) the Newcastle was all haughtiness
and coldness.  Mr. Pelham, who foresaw the storm, had prudently
prepared himself for the breach by all kind of invectives
against the house of Leveson.  The ground of all, besides
Newcastle's natural fickleness and jealousy, is, that the
Bedford and Sandwich have got the Duke.  A crash @as been
expected, but people now seem to think that they will rub on a
little longer, though all the world seems indifferent whether
they will or not.  Mankind is so sick of all the late follies
and changes, that nobody inquires or cares whether the Duke of
Newcastle is prime minister, or whom he will associate with
him.  The Bedfords have few attachments, and Lord Sandwich is
universally hated.  The only difficulty is, who shall succeed
them; and it is even a question whether some of the old
discarded must not cross over and figure in again.  I mean, it
has even been said, that Lord Granville(193) will once more be
brought upon the stage:-if he should, and should push too
forward, could they again persuade people to resign with them?
The other nominees for the secretaryship are, Pitt, the Vienna
Sir Thomas Robinson, and even that formal piece of dulness -,it
the Hague, Lord Holderness.  The talk of the Chancellor's being
president, in order to make room, by the promotion of the
Attorney to the seals, for his second son(194) to be solicitor,
as I believe I once mentioned to you, is revived;
though he told Mr. Pelham, that if ever he retired, it should
be to Wimple.(195)  In the mean time, the Master of the Horse,
the Groom of the Stole, the Presidentship, (vacant by the
nomination of Dorset to Ireland in the room of Lord Harrington,
who is certainly to be given up to his master's dislike,) and
the Blues, are still vacant.  Indeed, yesterday I heard that
Honeywood(196) was to have the latter.  Such is the Interregnum
of our politics! The Prince's faction lie still, to wait the
event, and the disclosing of the new treaty.  Your friend Lord
Fane,(197) some time ago had a mind to go to Spain: the Duke of
Bedford, who I really believe is an honest man, said very
bluntly, "Oh! my lord, nobody can do there but Keene." Lord
North is made governor to Prince George with a thousand a-year,
and an earl's patent in his pocket; but as the passing of the
patent is in the pocket of time, it would not sell for much.
There is a new preceptor, one Scott,(198) recommended by Lord
Bolingbroke.  You may add that recommendation to the chapter of
our wonderful politics.  I have received your letter from
Fiesoli Hill; poor Strawberry blushes to have you compare it
with such a prospect as yours.  I say nothing to the abrupt
sentences about Mr. B. I have long seen his humour--and a
little of your partiality to his wife.

We are alarmed with the distemper being got among the horses:
few have died yet, but a farrier who attended General
Ligonier's dropped down dead in the stable.  Adieu!

(192) The DUCHESSES of Newcastle and Bedford.

(193) "So anxious was the Duke of Newcastle to remove his
colleague, that he actually proposed either to open a
negotiation with Earl Granville for settling a new
administration, or to conciliate the Duke of Cumberland,
without the interposition of Mr. Pelham, by agreeing to
substitute Lord Sandwich in the room of the Duke of Bedford."

Bolingbroke, and that he was favoured by the Princess.-E.



86 Letter 33
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec. 19, 1750.

Well! you may be easy; your friends have been to see me at
last, but it has so happened that we have never once met, nor
have I even seen their persons.  They live at Newcastle-house;
and though I give you my word my politics are exceedingly
neutral, I happen to be often at the court of Bedford.  The
Interministerium still subsists; no place is filled up but the
Lieutenancy of Ireland; the Duke of Dorset was too impatient to
wait.  Lord Harrington remains a melancholy sacrifice to the
famous general Resignation,(199) which he led up, and of which
he is the only victim.  Overtures have been made to Lord
Chesterfield to be president; but he has declined it; for he
says he cannot hear causes, as he is grown deaf.  I don't think
the proposal was imprudent, for if they should happen, as they
have now and then happened, to want to get rid of him again, they
might without consequence; that is, I suppose nobody would
follow him out, any more than they did when he resigned
voluntarily.  For these two days every body has expected to see
Lord Granville president, and his friend the Duke of Bolton,
colonel of the Blues; two nominations that would not be very
agreeable, nor probably calculated to be so to the Duke, who
favours the Bedford faction.  His old governor Mr. Poyntz(200)
is just dead, ruined in his circumstances by a devout brother,
whom he trusted, and by a simple wife, who had a devotion of
marrying, dozens of her poor cousins at his expense: you know
she was the Fair Circassian.(201)  Mr. Poyntz was called a very
great man, but few knew any thing of his talents, for he was
timorous to childishness.  The Duke has done greatly for his
family, and secured his places for his children, and sends his
two sons abroad, allowing them eight hundred pounds a year.
The little Marquis of Rockingham has drowned himself in claret;
and old Lord Dartmouth is dead of ague.(202)  When Lord
Bolingbroke's last work was published, on the State of Parties
at the late King's accession, Lord Dartmouth said, he supposed
Lord Bolingbroke believed every body was dead who had lived at
that period.

There has been a droll cause in Westminster Hall: a man laid
another a wager that he produced a person who should weigh as
much again as the Duke.  When they had betted, they recollected
not knowing how to desire the Duke to step into a scale.  They
agreed to establish his weight at twenty stone, which, however,
is supposed to be two more than he weighs.  One Bright was then
produced, who is since dead, and who actually weighed forty-two
stone and a half.)203)  As soon as he was dead, the person who
had lost objected that he had been weighed in his clothes, and
thought it was impossible to suppose that his clothes could
weigh above two stone, they went to law.  There were the Duke's
twenty stone bawled over a thousand times,-but the righteous
law decided against the man who had won!

Poor Lord Lempster(204) is more Cerberus(205) than ever; (you
remember his bon-mot that proved such a blunder;) he has lost
twelve thousand pounds at hazard to an ensign of the Guards-but
what will you think of the folly of a young Sir Ralph Gore,(206)
who took it into his head that he would not be waited on by
drawers in brown frocks and blue aprons, and has literally given
all the waiters at the King's Arms rich embroideries and laced
clothes!  The town is still empty: the parties for the two
playhouses are the only parties that retain any spirit.  I will
tell you one or two bon-mots of Quin the actor.  Barry would have
had him play the ghost in Hamlet, a part much beneath the dignity
of Quin, who would give no other answer but, "I won't catch cold
behind."  I don't know whether you remember that the ghost is
always ridiculously dressed, with a morsel of armour before,
and only a black waistcoat and breech behind.  The other is an
old one, but admirable.  When Lord Tweedale was nominal
secretary of State for Scotland, Mitchell,(207) his secretary,
was supping With Quin, who wanted him to stay another bottle;
but he pleaded my lord's business.  "Then," said Quin, "only
stay till I have told you a story.  A vessel was becalmed: the
master called to one of the cabin-boys at the top of the mast,
'Jack, what are you doing?'  'Nothing, Sir.'  He called to
another boy, a little below the first, 'Will, what are you
doing?'  'Helping Jack, sir.'"  Adieu!

88 Letter 34
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Dec. 22, 1750.

As I am idling away some Christmas days here, I begin a letter
to you, that perhaps will not set out till next year.  Any
changes in the ministry will certainly be postponed till that
date: it is even believed that no alteration will be made till
after the session; they will get the money raised -,And the new
treaty ratified in Parliament before they break and part.  The
German ministers arc more alarmed, and seem to apprehend
themselves in as tottering a situation as some of the English:
not that any secretary of state is jealous of them--their
Countess(208) is on the wane.  The housekeeper(209) at Windsor,
an old monster that Verrio painted for one of the Furies, is
dead.  The revenue is large, and has been largely solicited.
Two days ago, at the drawing-room, the gallant Orondates strode
up to Miss Chudleigh, and told her he was glad to have an
opportunity of obeying her commands, that he appointed her
mother housekeeper at Windsor, and hoped she would not think a
kiss too great a reward--against all precedent he kissed her in
the circle.  He has had a hankering these two years.  Her life,
which is now of thirty years' standing, has been a little
historic.(210)  Why should not experience and a charming face on
her side, and near seventy years on his, produce a title?

Madame de Mirepoix is returned: she gives a lamentable account
of another old mistress,(211) her mother.  She has not seen her
since the Princess went to Florence, which she it seems has
left with great regret; with greater than her beauty, whose
ruins she has not discovered: but with few teeth, few hairs,
sore eyes, and wrinkles, goes bare-necked and crowned with
jewels! Madame Mirepoix told me  a reply of Lord Cornbury, that
pleased me extremely.  They have revived at Paris old
Fontenelle's opera of Peleus and Thetis: he complained of being
dragged upon the stage again for one of his juvenile
performances, and said he could not bear to be hissed now: Lord
Cornbury immediately replied to him out of the very opera,

"Jupiter en courroux
                                                              '
Ne peut rien contre vous,
Vous `etes immortel."

Our old laureat has been dying: when he thought himself at the
extremity, he wrote this lively, good-natured letter to the
Duke of Grafton:-

""May it please your Grace:
"I know no nearer way of repaying your favours for these last
twenty years than by recommending the bearer, Mr. Henry Jones,
for the vacant laurel: Lord Chesterfield will tell you more of
him.  I don't know the day of my death, but while I live, I
shall not cease to be, your Grace's, etc.

"Colley Cibber."                                        '

I asked my Lord Chesterfield who this Jones(212) is; he told me
a better poet would not take the post, and a worse ought not to
have it. There are two new bon-mots of his lordship much
repeated, better than his ordinary.  He says, he would not be
president, because he would not be between two fires;(213) and
that"the two brothers are like Arbuthnot's Lindamira and
Indamora;(214) the latter was an able, tractable gentlewoman, but
her sister was always quarrelling and kicking and as they grew
together, there was no parting them.

You will think my letters are absolute jest-and-story books,
unless you will be so good as to dignify them with the title of
Walpoliana.  Under that hope, I will tell you a very odd new
story.  A citizen had advertised a reward for the discovery of
a person who had stolen sixty guineas out of his scrutoire.  He
received a message from a condemned criminal in Newgate, with
the offer of revealing the thief.  Being a cautious grave
personage, he took two friends along with him.  The convict
told him that he was the robber; and when he doubted, the
fellow began with these circumstances; You came home such a
night, and put the money into your bureau: I was Under your
bed: you undressed, and then went to the foot of the garret
stairs, and cried, 'Mary, come to bed to me-'"  "Hold, hold,"
said the citizen, "I am convinced."  "Nay," said the fellow,
"you shell hear all, for our intrigue saved your life.  Mary
replied, 'If any body wants me, they may come up to me:' you
went: I robbed your bureau in the mean time, but should have
cut your throat, if you had gone into your bed instead of Mary
S."

The conclusion of my letter will be a more serious story, but
very proper for the Walpoliana.  I have given you scraps of
Ashton's history.  To perfect his ingratitude, he has struck up
an intimacy with my second brother, and done his utmost to make
a new quarrel between us, on the merit of having broke with me
on the affair of Dr. Middleton.  I don't know whether I ever
told you that my brother hated Middleton, who was ill with a
Dr. Thirlby,(215) a creature of his.  He carried this and his
jealousy of me so far, that once when Lord Mountford brought
Middleton for one night only to Houghton my brother wrote my
father a most outrageous letter, telling him that he knew I had
fetched Middleton to Houghton to write my father's life, and
how much more capable Thirlby was of this task.  Can one help
admiring in these instances the dignity of human nature!  Poor
Mrs. Middleton is alarmed with a scheme that I think she very
justly suspects as a plot of the clergy to get at and suppress
her husband's papers.  He died in a lawsuit with a builder, who
has since got a monition from the Commons for her to produce
all the Doctor's effects and papers.  The whole debt is but
eight hundred pounds.  She offered ten thousand pounds
security, and the fellow will not take it.  Is there clergy in
it, or no? Adieu!


(208) Lady Yarmouth.  The new amour did not proceed.

(209) Mrs. Marriot.

(210) She was, though maid of honour, privately married to
Augustus, second son of the late Lord Hervey, by whom she had
two children; but disagreeing, the match was not owned.  She
afterwards, still maid of honour, lived very publicly with the
Duke of Kingston, and at last married him during Mr. Hervey's
life.

(211) Princess Craon, formerly mistress of Leopold, Duke of
Lorraine.

(212) I think he was an Irish bricklayer; he wrote an "Earl of
Essex." ["Having a natural inclination for the Muses," says his
biographer, "he pursued his devotions to them even during the
labours of his more mechanical avocations, and composing a line
of brick and a line of verse alternately, his wall and poems
rose up in growth together."  His tragedy of the "Earl of
Essex" came out at Covent Garden in 1753, and met with
considerable success.  He died in great want, in 1770.-E.]

(213) Meaning President of the Council.  The two fires were the
Pelham brothers; between whom all private intercourse was at
this time suspended.-E.

Newcastle.

89 Letter 35
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 9, 1751.

You will wonder that I, who am pretty punctual, even when I
have little to say, should have been so silent at the beginning
of a session: I will tell you some reasons why; what I had to
tell you was not finished; I wished to give you an entire
account: besides, we have had so vigorous an attendance, that
with that, and the fatigue, it was impossible to write.  Before
the Parliament met, there was a dead tranquillity, and no
symptoms of party spirit.  What is more extraordinary, though
the Opposition set out vehemently the very first day, there has
appeared ten times greater spirit on the court side, a Whig
vehemence that has rushed on heartily.  I have been much
entertained-what should I have been, if I had lived in the
times of the Exclusion-bill, and the end of queen Anne's reign,
when votes and debates really tended to something! Now they
tend but to the alteration of a dozen places, perhaps, more or
less-but come, I'll tell you, and you shall judge for yourself.
The morning the Houses met, there was universally dispersed, by
the penny post, and by being dropped into the areas of houses,
a paper called Constitutional Queries, a little equivocal, for
it is not clear whether they were levelled at the Family, or by
Part of the Family at the Duke.(216)  The Address was warmly
opposed, and occasioned a remarkable speech of Pitt, in
recantation of his former orations on the Spanish, war, and in
panegyric on the Duke of Newcastle, wit whom e is pushing
himself, and by whom he is pushed at all rates, in opposition
to Lord Sandwich and the Bedfords.  Two or three days
afterwards there were motions in both Houses to have the
Queries publicly burnt.  That too occasioned a debate with us,
and a fine speech of Lord Egmont, artfully condemning the
paper, though a little suspected of it, and yet supporting some
of the reasonings in it.  There was no division on the
resolution; but two days afterwards we had a very extraordinary
and unforeseen one.  Mr. Pelham had determined to have 'but
8,000 seamen this year, instead of 10,000.  Pitt and his
cousins, without any notice given, declared with the Opposition
for the greater number.  The key to this you will find in Pit'S
whole behaviour; whenever he wanted new advancement, he used to
go off He has openly met with great discouragement now; though
he and we know Mr. Pelham so -well, that it Will not be
surprising if, though baffled, he still carries his point of
secretary of state.  However, the old corps resented this
violently, and rushed up their old anger: Mr. Pelham was
inclined to give way, but Lord Hartington, at the head of the
young Whigs, divided the House, and Pitt had the mortification
of being followed into the minority by only fifteen persons.  The
King has been highly pleased with this event; and has never
named the Pitts and Grenvilles to the Duke of Newcastle, but to
abuse them, and to commend the spirit of the young people.  It
has not weakened the Bedford faction, who have got more
strength by the clumsy politics of another set of their
enemies.  There has all the summer been a Westminster petition
in agitation, driven on by the independent electors, headed by
Lord Elibank, Murray his brother, and one or two gentlemen.
Sir John Cotton, and Cooke the member for Middlesex,
discouraged it all they could, and even stifled the first
drawn, which was absolutely treason.  However, Cooke at last
presented one from the inhabitants, and Lord Egmont another
from Sir George Vandeput; and Cooke even made a strong
invective against the High-bailiff; on which Lord Trentham
produced and read a letter written by Cooke to the
High-bailiff, when he was in their interest, and stuffed with
flattery to him.  Lord Trentham's friends then called in the
High-bailiff, who accused some persons of hindering and
threatening him on the scrutiny, and, after some contention,
named Crowle, counsel for Sir George Vandeput, Gibson, an
upholsterer and independent, and Mr. Murray.(217)  These three
were ordered to attend on the following Thursday to defend
themselves.  Before that day came, we had the report on the
eight thousand seamen, when Pitt and his associates made
speeches of lamentation on their disagreement with Pelham, whom
they flattered inordinately.  This ended in a burlesque quarrel
between Pitt and Hampden,(218) a buffoon who hates the
cousinhood, and thinks his name should entitle him to Pitt's
office.  We had a very long day on Crowle's defence, who had
called the power of the House brutum fulmen: he was very
submissive, and was dismissed with a reprimand on his knees.
Lord Egmont was so severely handled by Fox, that he has not
recovered his spirits since.  He used to cry up Fox against Mr.
Pelham, but since the former has seemed rather attached to the
Duke and the Duke of Bedford, the party affect to heap incense
on Pelham and Pitt--and it is returned.

The day that Murray came to the bar he behaved with great
confidence, but at last desired counsel, which was granted: in
the mean time we sent Gibson to Newgate.  Last Wednesday was
the day of trial: the accusation was plentifully proved against
Murray, and it was voted to send him close prisoner to Newgate.
His party still struggling against the term close, the Whigs
grew provoked, and resolved he should receive his sentence on
his knees at the bar.  To this he refused to submit.  The
Speaker stormed, and the House and its honour grew outrageous
at the dilemma they were got into, and indeed out of which we
are not got yet.  If he gets the better, he will indeed be a
meritorious martyr for the cause: en attendant, he is strictly
shut up in Newgate.(219)

By these anecdotes you will be able to judge a little of the
news you mention in your last, of January 29th, and will
perceive that our ministerial vacancies and successions are not
likely to be determined soon.  Niccolini's account of the
aversion to Lord Sandwich is well grounded, though as to
inflexible resentments, there cannot easily be any such thing,
where parties and factions are so fluctuating as in this
country.  I was to have dined the other day at Madame de
Mirepoix's with my Lord Bolingbroke, but he was ill.  She said,
she had repented asking me, as she did not know if I should
like it. , Oh! Madam, I have gone through too many of those
things to make any objection to the only one that remains!"

I grieve much for the return of pains in your head and breast;
I flattered myself that you had quite mastered them.

I have seen your Pelham and Milbank, not much, but I like the
latter; I have some notion, from thinking that he resembles you
in his manner.  The other seems very good-humoured, but he is
nothing but complexion.  Dame is returned; he looks ill; but I
like him better than I used to do, for he commends you.  My
Lord Pomfret is made ranger of the parks, and by consequence my
Lady is queen of the Duck Island.(220)  Our greatest miracle is
Lady Mary Wortley's son,(221) whose adventures have made so
much noise- his parts are not proportionate, but his expense is
incredible.  His father scarce allows him any thing: yet he
plays, dresses, diamonds himself, even to distinct shoe-buckles
for a frock, and has more snuff-boxes than would suffice a
Chinese idol with an hundred noses.  But the most curious part
of his dress, which he has brought from Paris, is an iron wig;
you literally would not know it from hair--I believe it is on
this account that the Royal Society have just chosen him of
their body.  This may surprise you: what I am now going to tell
you will not, for you have only known her follies - the Duchess
of Queensbury told Lady Di. Egerton,(222) a pretty daughter of
the Duchess of Bridgewater, that she was going to make a ball
for her: she did, but did not invite her: the girl was
mortified, and Mr. Lyttelton, her father-in-law, sent the mad
Grace a hint of it.  She sent back this card-. "The
advertisement came to hand; it was very pretty and very
ingenious; but every thing that is pretty and ingenious does not
always succeed; the Duchess of Q. piques herself on her house
being unlike Socrates's; his was small and held all his friends;
hers is large, but will not hold half of hers: postponed, but not
forgot: unalterable." Adieu!

94 Letter 36
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 13, 1751.

You will be expecting the conclusion of Mr. Murray's history,
but as he is too great a hero to submit, and not hero enough to
terminate his prison in a more summary, or more English way,
you must have patience, as we shall have, till the end of the
session.  His relations, who had leave to visit him, are
excluded again: rougher methods with him are not the style of
the age: in the mean time he is quite forgot.  General
Anstruther is now the object in fashion, or made so by a Sir
Harry Erskine, a very fashionable figure in the world of
politics, who has just come into Parliament, and has been
laying a foundation for the next reign by attacking the
Mutiny-bill, and occasionally General Anstruther, who treated
him hardly ten years ago in Minorca.  Anstruther has mutually
persecuted and been persecuted by the Scotch ever since
Porteous's affair, when, of all that nation, he alone voted for
demolishing part of Edinburgh.  This affair would be a trifle,
if it had not opened the long-smothered rivalship between Fox
and Pitt: for these ten days they have been civilly at war
together; and Mr. Pelham is bruised between both.  However,
this impetuosity of Pitt has almost overset the total
engrossment that the Duke of Newcastle had made of all power,
and if they do not, as it is suspected, league with the Prince,
you will not so soon hear of the fall of the Bedfords, as I had
made you expect.  With this quantity of factions ind infinite
quantity of speakers, we have had a most fatiguing session, and
seldom rise before nine or ten at night.

There have been two events, not political, equal to any
absurdities or follies of former years.  My Lady Vane(223) has
literally published the memoirs of her own life, Only
suppressing part of her lovers, no part of the success of the
others with her: a degree of profligacy not to be accounted
for; she does not want money, none of her lovers will raise her
credit; and the number, all she had to brag of, concealed! The
other is a play that has been acted by people of some fashion
at Drury Lane, hired on purpose.  They really acted so well
that it is astonishing they should not have had sense enough
not to act at all.  You would know none of their names, should I
tell you; but the chief were a family of Delavals, the eldest of
which was married by one Foote, a player, to Lady Nassau
Poulett,(224) who had kept the latter.  The rage was so great
to see this performance that the House of Commons literally
adjourned at three o'clock on purpose: the footman's gallery
was strung with blue ribands.  What a wise people! what an
august Senate! yet my Lord Granville once told the Prince, I
forget on occasion of what folly, "Sir, indeed your Royal
Highness is in the wrong to act thus; the English are a grave
nation."


The King has been much out of order, but he is quite well
again, and they say, not above sixty-seven! Adieu!

(223) Anne, second daughter of Mr. Hawes, the wife of William,

of the 3d of March, writes, "Has that miracle of tenderness and
sensibility (as she calls it), given you any amusement?
Peregrine, whom she uses as a vehicle, is very poor indeed,
with a few exceptions."-E.

To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 21, 1751.

What, another letter, -when I wrote to you but last week!-
-Yes--and with an event too big to be kept for a regular
interval.  You will imagine from the conclusion of my last
letter that our King is dead--or, before you receive this, you
will probably have heard by flying couriers that it is only our
King that was to be.  In short, the Prince died last night
between nine and ten.  If I don't tell you ample details, it is
because you must content yourself with hearing nothing but what
I know true.  He had had a pleurisy, and was recovered.  Last
Tuesday was se'nnight he went to attend the King's passing some
bills in the House of Lords; from thence to Carlton House, very
hot, where he unrobed, put on a light unaired frock and
waistcoat, went to Kew, walked in a bitter day, came home
tired, and lay down for three hours, upon a couch in a very
cold room at Carlton House, that opens into the garden.  Lord
Egmont told him how dangerous it was, but the Prince did not
mind him.  My father once said to this King, when he was ill
and royally untractable, "Sir, do you know what your father
died of? of thinking he could not die." In short, the Prince
relapsed that night, has had three physicians ever since, and
has never been supposed out of danger till yesterday: a thrush
had appeared, and for the two or three last evenings he had
dangerous suppressions of breath.  However, his family thought
him so well yesterday, that there were cards in his outward
room.  Between nine and ten he was seized with a violent fit of
coughing.  Wilmot, and Hawkins the surgeon, were present: the
former said, ,Sir, have you brought up all the phlegm? I hope
this will be over in a quarter of an hour, and that your Royal
Highness will have a good night."  Hawkins had occasion to go
out of the room, and said, "Here is something I don't like."
The cough continued; the prince laid his hand upon his stomach,
and said, "Je sens la mort." The page who held him up, felt him
shiver, and cried out, The Prince is going!"  The Princess was at
the feet of the bed; she catched up a
candle and ran to him, but before she got to the head of the
bed, he was dead.(225)

Lord North was immediately sent to the King, who was looking
over a table, where Princess Emily, the Duchess of Dorset, and
Duke of Grafton were playing.  He was extremely surprised, and
said, "Why, they told me he was better!" He bid Lord North tell
the Princess, he would do every thing she could desire; and has
this morning sent her a very kind message in writing.  He is
extremely shocked--but no pity is too much for the Princess;
she has eight children, and is seven months gone with another.
She bears her affliction with great courage and sense.  They
asked her if the body was to be opened; she replied, what the
King pleased.

This is all I know yet; you shall have fresh and fresh
intelligence--for reflections on minorities, Regencies,
Jacobitism, Oppositions, factions, I need not help you to them.
You will make as many as any body, but those who reflect on
their own disappointments.  The creditors are no inconsiderable
part of the moralists.  They talk of fourteen hundred thousand
pounds on post-obits.  This I am sure I don't vouch; I Only
know that I never am concerned to see the tables of the
money-changers overturned and cast out of the temple.(226)

I much fear, that by another post I shall be forced to tell you
news that will have much worse effects for my own family, My
Lord Orford has got such another violent boil as he had two
years ago--and a thrush has appeared too along with it.  We are
in the utmost apprehensions about him, the more, because there
is no possibility of giving him any about himself.  He has not
only taken an invincible aversion to physicians, but to the
bark, and we have no hopes from any thing else.  It will be a
fatal event for me, for your brother, and for his own son.
Princess Emily,(227) Mr. Pelham(228) and my Lady Orford, are
not among the most frightened.

Your brother, who dines here with Mr. Chute and Gray,(229) has
just brought me your letter of March 12th.  The libel you ask
about was called "Constitutional Queries:" have not you
received mine of February 9th? there was some account of our
present history.  Adieu! I have not time to write any longer to
you; but you may well expect our correspondence will thicken.

(225) Frederick, Prince of Wales, was a man in no way
estimable, though his understanding and disposition were cried
up by those who were in opposition to his father's government.
Walpole says of him, "His best quality was generosity; his
worst, insincerity and indifference to truth, which appeared so
early, that Earl Stanhope wrote to Lord Sunderland from
Hanover, "He has his father's head, and his mother's heart."
His death was undoubtedly a deliverance for those who, had he
lived, would have become his subjects.-D.

(226) Frederick, Prince of Wales's debts were never paid.-D.

(227) Princess Emily had the reversion of New-park.

Pelham, as chancellor of the exchequer, and first lord of the
treasury.

97 Letter 38
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 1, 1751.


How shall I begin a letter that will-that must give you as much
pain as I feel myself?  I must interrupt the story of the
Prince's death, to tell you of two more, much more important,
God knows! to you and me! One I had prepared you for-but how
will you be shocked to hear that our poor Mr. Whithed is
dead(230) as well as my brother! Whithed had had a bad cough
for two months: he was going out of town to the Minchester
assizes; I persuaded and sent him home from hence one morning
to be blooded.  However, he went, in extreme bad weather.  His
youngest brother, the clergyman, who is the greatest brute in
the world, except the elder brother, the layman, dragged him
out every morning to hunt, as eagerly as if it had been to hunt
heretics.  One day they were overturned in a water, and then
the parson made him ride forty miles: in short, he arrived it
the Vine half dead, and soon grew delirious.  Poor Mr. Chute
was sent for to him last Wednesday, and sent back for two more
physicians, but in vain; he expired on Friday night!  Mr. Chute
is come back half distracted, and scarce to be known again.
You may easily believe that my own distress does not prevent my
doing all in my power to alleviate his.  Whithed, that best of
hearts, had forgiven all his elder brother's beastliness, and
has left him the Norton estate, the better half; the rest to
the clergyman, with an annuity of one hundred and twenty pounds
a year to his Florentine mistress, and six hundred pounds to
their child.  He has left Mr. Chute one thousand pounds, which,
if forty times the sum, would not comfort him, and, little as
it is, does not in the least affect or alter his concern.
Indeed, he not only loses an intimate friend, but in a manner
an only child; he had formed him to be one of the prettiest
gentlemen in England, and had brought about a match for him,
that was soon to be concluded with a Miss Nicholl, an immense
fortune; and I am persuaded had fixed his heart on making him
his own heir, if he himself outlived his brother.  With such a
fortune, and with such expectations, how hard to die!--or,
perhaps, how lucky, before he had tasted misfortune and
mortification.

I must now mention my own misfortune, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday mornings, the physicians and all the family of painful
death,(231) (to alter Gray's phrase,) were persuaded and
persuaded me, that the bark, which took great place, would save
my brother's life --but he relapsed at three o'clock on
Thursday, and died last night.  He ordered to be drawn and
executed his will with the greatest tranquillity and
satisfaction on Saturday morning.  His spoils are
prodigious-not to his own family! indeed I think his son the
most ruined young man in England.  My loss, I fear, may be
considerable, which is not the only motive of my concern, though,
as you know, I had much to forgive, before I could regret: but
indeed I do regret.  It is no small addition to my concern, to
fear or foresee that Houghton and all the remains of my father's
glory will be pulled to pieces! The widow-Countess immediately
marries--not Richcourt, but Shirley, and triumphs in advancing
her son's ruin by enjoying her own estate, and tearing away
great part of his.

Now I shall divert your private grief by talking to you of what
is called the public.  The King and Princess are grown as fond
as it they had never been of different parties, or rather as
people who always had been of different.  She discountenances
all opposition, and he all ambition.  Prince George, who, with
his two eldest brothers, is to be lodged at St. James's, is
speedily to be created Prince of Wales.  Ayscough, his tutor,
is to be removed, with her entire inclination as well as with
every body's approbation.  They talk of a Regency to be
established (in case of a minority) by authority of Parliament,
even this session, with the Princess at the head of it.  She
and Dr. lee, the only one she consults of the late cabal, very
sensibly burned the late Prince's papers the moment he was
dead.  lord Egmont, by seven o'clock the next morning, summoned
(not very decently) the faction to his house: all was whisper!
at least he hinted something of taking the Princess and her
children under their protection, and something of the necessity
of harmony.  No answer was made to the former proposal.
Somebody said, it was very likely indeed they should agree now,
when the Prince could never bring it about: and so every body
went away to take care of himself.  The imposthumation is
supposed to have proceeded, not from his fall last year, but
from a blow with a tennis-ball some years ago.  The grief for
the dead brother is affectedly great; the aversion to the
living one as affectedly displayed.  They cried about an
elegy,(232) and added, "Oh, that it were but his brother!" On
'Change they said, "Oh, that it were but the butcher!(233)"

The Houses sit, but no business will be done till after the
holidays.  AnStruther's affair will go on, but not with MUCH
spirit.  One wants to see faces about again!  Dick lyttelton,
one of the patriot officers, had collected depositions on oath
against the Duke for his behaviour in Scotland, but I suppose
he will now throw his papers into Ham/let's grave?

Prince George, who has a most amiable countenance, behaved
excessively well on his father's death.  When they told him of
it, he turned pale, and laid his hand on his breast.  Ayscough
said, "I am afraid, Sir, you are not well!"-he replied, "I feel
something here, just as I did when I saw the two workmen fall
from the scaffold at Kew."  Prince Edward is a very plain boy,
with strange loose eyes, but was much the favourite. He is a
sayer of things! Two men were heard lamenting the death in
Leicester-fields: one said, "He has left a great many small
children!"-"Ay," replied the other, "and what is worse, they
belong to our parish!" But the most extraordinary reflections
on his death were set forth in a sermon at Mayfair chapel. "He
had no great parts, (pray mind, this was the parson said so,
not I,) but he had great virtues; indeed, they degenerated into
vices - he was very generous, but I hear his generosity has
ruined a great many people: and then his condescension was
such, that he kept very bad company."

Adieu! my dear child; I have tried, you see, to blend so much
public history with our private griefs, as may help to
interrupt your too great attention to the calamities in the
former part of my letter.  You will, with the properest
good-nature in the world, break the news to the poor girl, whom
I pity, though I never saw.  Miss Nicholl is, I am told,
extremely to be pitied too; but so is every body that knew
Whithed! Bear it yourself as well as you can!

(230) Francis Thistlethwaite, who took the name of Whithed for
his uncle's estate and, as heir to him, recovered Mr. Norton's
estate, which he had left to the Parliament for the use of the
poor, etc,; but the will was set aside for insanity. [See
ant`e.)

(231) Vide Gray's Ode on a distant prospect of Eton College.

(232) Walpole, in his Memoires, vol. i. p. 504, says, "The
following which is the elegy alluded to, was probably the
effusion of some Jacobite royalist.  That faction could not,
forgive the Duke of Cumberland his excesses or successes in
Scotland; and not content with branding the parliamentary
government of the country as usurpation, indulged in frequent
unfailing and scurrilous personalities on every branch of the
reigning family.

"Here lies Fred,
Who was alive and is dead:
Had it been his father,
I had much rather:
Had it been his brother,
Still better than another;
Had it been his sister,
No one would have missed her;
Had it been the whole generation,
Still better for the nation;
But since 'tis only Fred,
Who was alive and is dead-
There is no more to be said."-E.

culloden, by his opponents nicknamed Billy the Butcher.-E.



99 Letter 39
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 22, 1751.

I could not help, my dear child, being struck with the
conclusion of your letter of the 2d of this month, which I have
just received; it mentions the gracious assurances you had
received from the dead Prince--indeed, I hope you will not want
them.  The person(234) who conveyed them was so ridiculous as
to tell your brother that himself was the most disappointed of
all men, he and the Prince having settled his first ministry in
such a manner that nothing could have defeated the plan.(235)
An admirable scheme for power in England, founded only on two
persons!  Some people say he was to be a duke and
secretary of state.  I would have him drawn like Edward V. with
the coronet hanging over his head.  You will be entertained
with a story of Bootle: his washerwoman came to a friend of
hers in great perplexity, and said, "I don't know what to do,
pray advise me; my master is gone the circuit, and left me
particular orders to send him an express if the King died: but
here's the Prince, dead and he said nothing about him." You
would easily believe this story, if you knew what a mere
law-pedant it is!

The Lord(236) you hint at, certainly did not write the Queries,
nor ever any thing so well: he is one of the few discarded; for
almost all have offered their services, and been accepted.  The
King asked the Princess if she had a mind for a master of the
horse; that it must be a nobleman, and that he had objections
to a particular One, Lord Middlesex.  I believe she had no
objection to his objections, and desired none.  Bloodworth is
at the head of her stables; of her ministry, Dr. Lee; all knees
bow to him.  The Duke of Newcastle is so charmed with him, and
so sorry he never knew him before, and can't live without him!
He is a grave, worthy man; as a civilian, not much versed in
the world of this end of the town, but much a gentleman.  He
made me a visit the other day on my brother's death, and talked
much of the great and good part the King had taken, (who by the
way, has been taught by the Princess to talk as much of him,)
and that the Prince's servants could no longer oppose, if they
meant to be consistent.  I told this to Mr. Chute, who replied
instantly, , "Pho! he meant to be subsistent." You will not be
surprised, though you will be charmed, with a new instance of
our friend's disinterested generosity: so far from resenting
Whithed's neglect of him, he and your brother, on finding the
brute-brothers making difficulties about the child's fortune,
have taken upon them to act as trustees for her, and to stand
all risks.  Did not Mr. Whithed know that Mr. Chute would act
just so?

Prince George is created Prince of Wales, and his household is
settle(].  Lord Harcourt is his governor, in the room of Lord
North, to whom there was no objection but his having a glimpse
of parts more than the new one, who is a creature of the
Pelhams, and very fit to cipher where Stone is to figure.  This
latter is sub-governor, with the Bishop of Norwich,(237)
preceptor; and Scott sub-preceptor.  The Bishop is a sensible,
good-humoured gentleman, and believed to be a natural son of
the old Archbishop of York.(238)  Lord Waldegrave, long a
personal favourite of the King, who has now got a little
interest at his own court, is warden of the stannaries, in the
room of Tom Pitt; old Selwyn, treasurer; Lord Sussex,(239) Lord
Downe,(240) and Lord Robert Bertle,(241) lords of the
bedchamber; Peachy, a young Schutz, and Digby, grooms: but
those of the House of Commons have not kissed hands yet, a
difficulty being started, whether, as they are now nominated by
the King, it will not vacate their Seats.(242)  Potter has
resigned as secretary to the Princess, and is succeeded by one
Cressett, his predecessor, her chief favourite, and allied to
the house of Hanover by a Duchess of Zell,(243) who was of a
French family-not of that of Bourbon.  I was going on to talk
to you of the Regency; but as that measure is not complete, I
shall not send away my letter till the end of next week.

My private satisfaction in my nephew of Orford is very great
indeed; he has an equal temper of reason and goodness that is
most engaging.  His mother professes to like him as much as
every body else does, but is so much a woman that she will not
hurt him at all the less.  So far from contributing to retrieve
his affairs, she talks to him of nothing but mob stories of his
grandfather's having laid up--the Lord knows where!--three
hundred thousand pounds for him; and of carrying him with her
to Italy, that he may converse with sensible people!  In
looking over her husband's papers, among many of her
intercepted billets-doux, I was much entertained with one,
which was curious for the whole orthography, and signed
Stitara: if Mr. Shirley was to answer it in the same romantic
tone, I am persuaded he would subscribe himself the dying
Hornadatus.  The other learned Italian Countess(244) is
disposing of her fourth daughter, the fair Lady Juliana, to
Penn, the wealthy sovereign of Pennsylvania;(245) but the
nuptials are adjourned till he recovers of a wound in his
thigh, which he got by his pistol going off as he was
overturned in his post-chaise.  Lady Caroline Fox has a legacy
of five- thousand pounds from Lord Shelburne,(246) a distant
relation, who never saw her but once, and that three weeks before
his death.  Two years ago Mr. Fox got the ten thousand pound
prize.

May 1, 1751.

I find I must send away my letter this week, and reserve the
history of the Regency for another post.  The bill was to have
been brought into the House of lords to-day, but Sherlock, the
Bishop of London, has raised difficulties against the
limitation of the future Regent's authority, which he asserts
to be repugnant to the spirit of our Constitution.  Lord Talbot
had already determined to oppose it; and the Pitts and
Lyttelton's, who are grown very mutinous on the Newcastle's not
choosing Pitt for his colleague, have talked loudly against it
without doors.  The preparatory steps to this great event I
will tell you.  The old Monarch grandchildizes exceedingly: the
Princess, who is certainly a wise woman, and who, in a course
of very difficult situations, has never made an enemy nor had a
detractor, has got great sway there.  The Pelhams, taking
advantage of this new partiality, of the universal dread of the
Duke, and of the necessity of his being administrator of
Hanover, prevailed to have the Princess Regent, but with a
council of nine of the chief great officers, to be continued in
their posts till the majority, which is fixed for eighteen;
nothing to be transacted without the assent of the greater
number; and the Parliament that shall find itself existing at
the King's death to subsist till the minority ceases: such
restrictions must be almost as unwelcome to the Princess as the
whole regulation is to the Duke.  Judge of his resentment: he
does not conceal it.  The divisions in the ministry are neither
closed nor come to a decision.  Lord Holderness arrived
yesterday, exceedingly mortified at not finding himself
immediate secretary of state, for which purpose he was sent
for; but Lord Halifax would not submit to have this cipher
preferred to him.  An expedient was proposed of flinging the
American province into the Board of Trade, but somehow or
other, that has miscarried, and all is at a stand.  It is known
that Lord Granville is designed for president-and for what more
don't you think?-he has the inclination of the King--would they
be able again to persuade people to resign unless he is
removed?-and will not all those who did resign with that
intention endeavour to expiate that insult?

Amid all this new clash of politics Murray has had an
opportunity for one or two days of making himself talked of.  A
month ago his brother(247) obtained leave, on pretence of his
health, to remove him into the custody of the sergeant-at-arms;
but he refused to go thither, and abused his brother for
meanness in making such submissive application.  On this his
confinement was straitened.  Last week, my worthy cousin, Sir
John Philips, moved the King's Bench for a rule to bring him
thither, in order to his having his habeas corpus.  He was
produced there the next day; 'but the three Judges, onhearing he
was committed by the House of Commons, acknowledged the
authority, and remanded him back.  There was a disposition to
commit Sir John, but we have liked to be-pleased with this
acknowledgment of our majesty.

Stitara(248) has declared to her son that she is marrying
Shirley, but ties him up strictly.  I am ready to begin again
with a panegyric of My nephew, but I will rather answer a
melancholy letter I have Just received from you.  His affairs
are putting into the best situation we can, and we are
agitating a vast match for him, which, if it can be brought to
bear, will even save your brother, whose great tenderness to
mine has left him exposed to greater risks than any of the
creditors.  For myself, I think I shall escape tolerably, as my
demands are from my father, whose debts are likely to be
satisfied.  My uncle Horace is indefatigable in adjusting all
this confusion.  Do but figure him at seventy-four, looking,
not merely well for his age, but plump, ruddy, and without a
wrinkle or complaint; doing every body's business, full of
politics as ever, from morning till night, and then roaming the
town to conclude with a party at whist!  I have no
apprehensions for your demands on Doddington; but your brother,
who sees him, will be best able to satisfy you on that head.

Madame de Mirepoix's brother-in-law was not Duke, but Chevalier
de Boufflers.  Here is my uncle come to drop me a bit of
marriage-settlements on his road to his rubbers, so I must
finish--you will not be sorry; at least I have given you some
light to live upon.  Adieu!

(235) The following is Dodington's own account of this plan:-
-"March 21.  When this unfortunate event happened, I had set on
foot a project for a union between the independent Whigs and
Tories, by a writing, renouncing all tincture of Jacobitism,
and affirming short constitutional Revolution principles.
These parties, so united, were to lay this paper, containing
these principles, before the Prince, offering to appear as his
party now, and upon those principles to undertake the
administration when he was King, in the subordination and rank
among themselves that he should please to appoint.  Father of
mercy! thy hand that wounds alone can save!" Diary, P. 88.-E.

Reviewer of Walpole's Memoires, alluding to a similar statement
made in that work says,--"As to the accusations of bastardy and
profligacy brought against the Bishop and Archbishop, they
were, probably, either the creatures of Walpole's own anxiety
to draw striking characters, or the echoes of some of those
slanderous murmurs which always accompany persons who rise from
inferior stations to eminence.  He tells us without any
hesitation, that Bishop Hayter was a natural son of archbishop
Blackburne's.  Now we have before us extracts from the
registers of the parish of Chagford, in Devonshire, which prove
that the Bishop Thomas Hayter was 'the son of George Hayter,
rector of this parish, and of Grace his wife,' and that Thomas
was one of a family of not fewer, we believe, than ten children

103 Letter 40
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 30, 1751.

In your last of May 14th, you seem uneasy at not having heard
from me in two posts.  I have writ you so exactly all the
details that I know you would wish to hear, that I think my
letters must have miscarried.  I will mention all the dates of
this year; Feb. 8th, March 14th and 21st, April 1st, and May
1st; tell me if you have received all these.  I don't pretend
to say any thing to alleviate your concern for the late
misfortunes, but will only recommend to you to harden yourself
against every accident, as I endeavour to do.  The
mortifications and disappointments I have experienced have
taught me the philosophy that dwells not merely in speculation.
I choose to think about the world, as I have always found, when
I most wanted its comfort, it thought about me, that is, not at
all.  It is a disagreeable dream which must end for every body
else as well as for oneself.  Some try to supply the emptiness
and vanity of present life by something still more empty, fame.
I choose to comfort myself, by  considering that even while I am
lamenting any present uneasiness it is actually passing away.  I
cannot feel the comfort of folly, because I am not a fool, and I
scarce know any other being that it is worth one's while to wish
to be.  All this looks as if it proceeded from a train of
melancholy ideas--it does so: but misfortunes have that good in
them that they teach one indifference.

if I Could be mortified anew, I should be with a new
disappointment, The immense and uncommon friendship of Mr.
Chute had found a method of saving both my family and yours.
In short, in the height of his affliction for Whithed, whom he
still laments immoderately, he undertook to get Miss Nicholl,
the vast fortune, a fortune of above 150,000 pounds, whom
Whithed was to have had, for Lord Orford.  He actually
persuaded her to run away from her guardians, who used her
inhumanly, and are her next heirs.  How clearly he is
justified, you will see, when I tell you that the man, who has
eleven hundred a-year for her maintenance, with which he
stopped the demands Of his own creditors, instead of employing
it for her maintenance and education, is since gone into the
Fleet.    After such fair success, Lord Orford has refused to
marry her; why, nobody can guess.  Thus had I placed him in a
greater situation than even his grandfather hoped to bequeath
to him, had retrieved all the oversights of my family, had
saved Houghton and all our glory!-Now, all must go!-and what
shocks me infinitely more, Mr. Chute, by excess of treachery,
(a story too long for a letter,) is embroiled with his own
brother the story, with many others, I believe I shall tell you
in person; for I do not doubt but the disagreeable scenes which
I have still to go through, will at last drive me to where I
have long proposed to seek some peace.  But enough of these
melancholy ideas!

The Regency-bill has passed with more ease than could have been
expected from so extraordinary a measure; and from the warmth
with which it was taken up one day in the House of Commons.  In
the Lords there were but 12 to 106, and the former, the most
inconsiderable men in that House.  Lord Bath and Lord Grenville
spoke vehemently for it: the former in as wild a speech, with
much parts, as ever he made in his patriot days; and with as
little modesty he lamented the scrambles that he had seen for
power! In our House, Mr. Pelham had four signal mortifications:
the Speaker, in a most pathetic and fine speech, Sir John
Barnard, and Lord Cobham,(249) speaking against, and Mr. Fox,
though voting for it, tearing it to pieces.  Almost all the
late Prince's people spoke or voted for it; most, pretending
deference to the Princess, though her power is so much abridged
by it.  However, the consolation that resides in great
majorities balanced the disagreeableness of particular
oppositions. We sit, and shall sit, till towards the end of
June, though with little business of importance.  If there
happens any ministerial struggle, which seems a little asleep at
present, it will scarce happen till after the prorogation.

Adieu! my dear child; I have nothing else worth telling you at
present--at least, the same things don't strike me that used to
do; or what perhaps is more true, when things of consequence
takes one up, one can't attend to mere trifling.  When I say
this, you will ask me, where is my philosophy! Even where the
best is: I think as coolly as I can, I don't exaggerate what is
disagreeable, and I endeavour to lessen it, by undervaluing
what I am inclined to think would be a happier state.

(249) Richard Grenville, eldest son of Richard Grenville, of
Wotton, Esq. and of Esther Temple, Countess Temple and
Viscountess Cobham, in her own right.  Lord Cobham became well
known in the political world as Earl Temple; which title he
succeeded to on the decease of his mother in 1752.-D.



105 Letter 41
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 30, 1751.

Mrs. Boscawen says I ought to write to you.  I don't think so.
you desired I would, if I had any things new to tell you; I
have not.  Lady Caroline and Miss Ashe had quarrelled, about
reputations before you went out of town.  I suppose you would
not give a straw to know all the circumstances of a Mr. Paul
killing a Mr. Dalton, though the town, who talks of any thing,
talks of nothing else.  Mrs. French and her Jeffery are parted
again.  Lady Orford and Shirley married: they say she was much
frightened; it could not be for fear of what other brides dread
of happening, but for fear it should not happen.

My evening yesterday was employed, how wisely do You think?  in
trying to procure for the Duchess of Portland a scarlet spider
from Admiral Boscawen.  I had just seen her collection, which
is indeed magnificent, chiefly composed of the spoils of her
father's, and the Arundel collections.  The gems of all sorts
are glorious.  I was diverted with two relics of St. Charles
the Martyr; one, the pearl you see in his pictures, taken out
of his ear after his foolish head was off; the other, the cup
out of which he took his last sacrament.  They should be given
to that nursery of nonsense and bigotry, Oxford.

I condole with you on your journey, am glad Miss Montagu is in
better health, and am yours sincerely.



105 Letter 42
To The Rev. Joseph Spence.(250)
Arlington Street, June 3, 1751.

Dear sir,
I have translated the lines, and send them to you; but the
expressive conciseness and beauty of the original, and my
disuse of turning
106
verses, made it so difficult, that I beg they may be of no
other use than that of showing you how readily I complied with
your request.

"Illam, quicquid agit, quoquo vestilia vertit,
Componit furtim subsequiturque decor."

"If she but moves or looks, her step, her face,
By stealth adopt unmeditated grace."

There are twenty little literal variations that may be made,
and are of no consequence, as 'move' or 'look'; 'air' instead
of 'step', and 'adopts' instead of 'adopt': I don't know even
whether I would not read 'steal and adopt', instead of 'by
stealth adopt'.  But none of these changes will make the copy
half so pretty as the original.  But what signifies that? I am
not obliged to be a poet because Tibullus was one; nor is it
just now that I have discovered I am not.  Adieu!

Anecdotes, p. 349.-E.



106 Letter 43
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, June 13, 1751.

You have told me that it is charity to write you news into
Kent; but what if my news should shock you! Won't it rather be
an act of cruelty to tell you, your relation, Sandwich,(251) is
immediately to be removed; and that the Duke of Bedford and all
the Gowers will resign to attend him? Not quite all the Gowers,
for the Earl himself keeps the privy-seal and plays on at brag,
with Lady Catherine Pelham, to the great satisfaction of the
Staffordshire Jacobites, who desire, at least expect, no better
diversion than a division in that house.  Lord Trentham does
resign.  Lord Hartington is to be master of the horse, and
called up to the House of Peers.  Lord Granville is to be
president; if he should resent any former resignations and
insist on victims, will Lord Hartington assure the menaced that
they shall not be sacrificed?

I hear your friend Lord North is wedded: somebody said it is
very hot weather to marry so fat a bride; George Selwyn
replied, "Oh! she was kept in ice for three days before."

The first volume of Spenser is published with prints, designed
by Kent; but the most execrable performance you ever beheld.
The graving not worse than the drawing; awkward knights,
scrambling Unas, hills tumbling down themselves, no variety Of
prospect and three or four perpetual spruce firs.

Our charming Mr. Bentley is doing Gray as much more honour as
he deserves than Spencer.  He is drawing vignettes for his
Odes; what a valuable MS.  I shall have!  Warburton publishes
his edition of Pope next week, with the famous piece of prose
on Lord Hervey,(252) which he formerly suppressed at my uncle's
desire; who had got an abbey from Cardinal Fleury for one
Southcote, a friend of Pope's.(253)  My Lord Hervey pretended
not to thank him.  I am told the edition has waited, because
Warburton has cancelled above a hundred sheets (in which he had
inserted notes) since the publication of the Canons of
Criticism.(254)  The new history of Christina is a most
wretched piece of trumpery, stuffed with foolish letters and
confutations of Mademoiselle de Montpensier and Madame de
Motteville.  Adieu! Yours ever.

(251) John Montagu, fourth Earl of Sandwich.

(252) Entitled "A Letter to a Noble Lord, on occasion of some
libels written and propagated at court, in the year 1732-3."-E.

(253) According to Spence, the application was made by Pope to
Sir Robert Walpole; but Dr. Warton states, that, "in gratitude
for the favour conferred on his friend, Pope presented to
Horatio Walpole, afterwards Lord Walpole, a set of his works in
quarto, richly bound; which are now in the library at
Wollerton."-E.

(254) Edwards's "Canons of Criticism;" a series of notes on
Warburton's edition of Shakspeare.  Johnson thought well of it;
but upon some one endeavouring to put the author upon a level
with Warburton, "Nay," said the Doctor, "he has given him some
smart hits, but the two men must not be named together: a fly,
sir, may sting a stately horse, and make him wince; but one is
but an insect, and the other is a horse still."-E.



107 Letter 44
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 18, 1751.

I sent my letter as usual from the secretary's office, but of
what secretary I don't know.  Lord Sandwich last week received
his dismission, on which the Duke of Bedford resigned the next
day, and Lord Trentham with him, both breaking with old Gower,
who is entirely in the hands of the Pelhams, and made to
declare his quarrel with Lord Sandwich (who gave away his
daughter to Colonel Waldegrave) the foundation 4 his detaching
himself from the Bedfords.  Your friend Lord Fane(255) comforts
Lord Sandwich with an annuity of a thousand a-year-scarcely for
his handsome behaviour to his sister!  Lord Hartington is to be
master of the horse, and Lord Albemarle groom of the stole;
Lord Granville is actually lord president, and, by all outward
and visible signs, something more-in short, if he don't
overshoot himself, the Pelhams have; the King's favour to him
is visible, and so much credited, that all the incense is
offered to him.  It is believed that Impresario Holderness will
succeed the Bedford in the foreign seals, and Lord Halifax in
those for the plantations.  If the former does, you will have
ample instructions to negotiate for singers and dancers! Here
is an epigram made upon his directorship.

"That secrecy will now prevail
In politics, is certain;
Since Holderness, who gets the seals,
Was bred behind the curtain."

The Admirals Rowley and Boscawen are brought into the admiralty
under Lord Anson, who is advanced to the head of the board.
Seamen are tractable fishes! especially it will be Boscawen's
case, whose name in Cornish signifies obstinacy, and who brings
along with him a good quantity of resentment to Anson.  In
short, the whole present system is equally formed for duration!

Since I began my letter, Lord Holderness has kissed hands for
the seals.  It is said that Lord Halifax is to be made easy, by
the plantations being put under the Board of Trade.  Lord
Granville comes into power as boisterously as ever, and dashes
at every thing.  His lieutenants already beat up for
volunteers; but he disclaims all connexions with Lord Bath,
who, he says, forced him upon the famous ministry of
twenty-four hours, and by which he says he paid all his debts
to him.  This will soon grow a turbulent scene-it 'Is not
unpleasant to sit upon the beach and see it; but few people
have the curiosity to step out to the sight.  You, who knew
England in other times, will find it difficult to conceive what
an indifference reigns with regard to ministers and their
squabbles.  The two Miss Gunnings,(256) and a late extravagant
dinner at White's, are twenty times more the subject of
conversation than the two brothers and Lord Granville.  These
are two Irish girls, of no fortune, who are declared the
handsomest women alive.  I think their being two so handsome
and both such perfect figures is their chief excellence, for
singly I have seen much handsomer women than either; however,
they can't walk in the park, or go to Vauxhall, but such mobs
follow them that they are generally driven away.  The dinner
was a folly of seven young men, who bespoke it to the utmost
extent of expense: one article was a tart made of duke cherries
from a hothouse; and another, that they tasted but one glass
out of each bottle of champagne.  The bill of fare has got into
print, and with good people has produced the apprehension of
another earthquake.  Your friend St. Leger, was at the head of
these luxurious heroes--he is the hero of all fashion.  I never
saw more dashing vivacity and absurdity, with some flashes of
parts.  He had a cause the other day for duelling a sharper,
and was going to swear: the judge said to him, "I see, Sir, you
are very ready to take an oath."  "Yes, my lord," replied St.
Leger, "my father was a judge."

We have been overwhelmed with lamentable Cambridge and Oxford
dirges on the Prince's death: there is but one tolerable copy;
it is by a young Lord Stormont,(257) a nephew of Murray, who is
much commended.  You may imagine what incense is offered to
Stone by the people of Christ Church: they have hooked in, too
poor Lord Harcourt, and call him Harcourt the Wise! his wisdom
has already disgusted the young Prince; "Sir, pray hold up your
head.  Sir, for Cod's sake, turn out your toes!"  Such are
Mentor's precepts!

I am glad you receive my letters; as I knew I had been
punctual, it mortified me that you should think me remiss.
Thank you for the transcript from Bubb de tribes!(258)  I will
keep your secret, though I am persuaded that a man who had
composed such a funeral oration on his master and himself fully
intended that its flowers should not bloom and wither in
obscurity.

We have already begun to sell the pictures that had not found
place at Houghton: the sale gives no great encouragement to
proceed; (though I fear it must come to that!) the large
pictures were thrown away: the whole length Vandykes went for a
song! I am mortified now at having printed the catalogue.
Gideon the Jew, and Blakiston(259) the independent grocer, have
been the chief purchasers of the pictures sold already--there,
if you love moralizing!  Adieu! I have no more articles to-day
for my literary gazette.

(255) Lord Sandwich married Dorothy, sister of Charles, Lord
Viscount Fane.

(256) Afterwards Countess of Coventry, and Duchess of Hamilton
and Argyll.-D.

(257) David Murray, seventh Viscount Stormont, ambassador at
Vienna and Paris, and president of the council.  He died in
1796.-D.

(258) A letter to Mr. Mann from Bubb Doddington on the Prince's
death.  It is dated June 4, and contains the following
bombastic and absurd passage: which, however, proves how great
were the expectations of Doddington, if the prince had lived to
succeed his father: ,We have lost the delight and ornament of
the age he lived in, the expectations of the public-in this
light I have lost more than any subject in England, but this is
light; public advantages confined to myself do not, ought not,
to weigh with me.  But we have lost the refuge of private
distress, the balm of the afflicted heart, the shelter of the
miserable against the fang of private calamity; the arts, the
graces, the anguish, the misfortunes of society have lost their
patron and their remedy.  I have lost my protector, my
companion, my friend that loved me, that condescended to bear,
to communicate, and to share in all the pleasures and pains of
the human heart, where the social affections and emotions of
the mind only presided, without regard to the infinite
disproportion of our rank and condition.  This is a wound that
cannot, ought not, to heal--if I pretended to fortitude here I
should be infamous, a monster of ingratitude; and unworthy of
all consolation, if I was not inconsolable.-D.

(259) Blakiston has been caught in smuggling, and pardoned by
Sir Robert Walpole; but continuing the practice, and being
again detected was fined five thousand pounds; on which he grew
a violent party man, and a ringleader of the Westminster
independent electors, and died an alderman of London.



109 Letter 45
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 16, 1751.

I shall do little more to-day than answer your last letter of
the 2d of this month; there is no kind of news.  My chief
reason for writing to you is to notify a visit that you will
have at Florence this summer from Mr. Conway, who is forced to
go to his regiment at Minorca, but is determined to reckon
Italy within his quarters.  You know how, particularly he is my
friend; I need not recommend him to you; but you will see
something very different from the staring boys that come in
flocks to you new, once a year, like woodcocks.  Mr. Conway is
deservedly reckoned one of the first and most rising young men
in England.  He has distinguished himself in the greatest style
both in the army and in Parliament.  This is for you. for the
Florentine ladies, there is still the finest person and the
handsomest face I ever saw--no, I cannot say that all this will
be quite for them; he will not think any of them so handsome as
my Lady Aylesbury.

It is impossible to answer you why my Lord Orford would not
marry Miss Nicholl.  I don't believe there was any particular
reason or attachment any where else; but unfortunately for
himself and for us, he is totally insensible to his situation,
and talks of selling Houghton with a coolness that wants
nothing but being intended for philosophy to be the greatest
that ever was.  Mind, it is a virtue that I envy more than I
honour.

I am going into Warwickshire to Lord Hertford, and set out this
evening, and have so many things to do that you must excuse me,
for I neither know what I write, nor have time to write more.
Adieu!



110 Letter 46
To George Montagu, Esq.
Daventry, July 22, 1751.


You will wonder in what part of the county of Twicks lies this
Daventry.  It happens to be in Northamptonshire.  My letter
will scarce set out till I get to London, but I choose to give
it its present date lest you should admire, that Mr. Usher of
the exchequer, the lord treasurer of pen, ink, and paper,
should write with such coarse materials.  I am on my way from
Ragley,(260) and if ever the waters subside and my ark rests
upon dry land again, I think of stepping over to TOnghes: but
your journey has filled my postchaise's head with such terrible
ideas of your roads, that I think I shall let it have done
raining for a month or six weeks, which it has not done for as
much time past, before I begin to grease my wheels again, and
lay in a provision of French books, and tea, and blunderbusses,
for my journey.

Before I tell you a word of Ragley, you must hear how busy I
have been upon Grammont.  You know I have long had a purpose of
a new edition, with notes, and cuts of the principal beauties
and heroes, if I could meet with their portraits.  I have made
out all the people at all remarkable except my Lord Janet, whom
I cannot divine unless he be Thanet.  Well, but what will
entertain you is, that I have discovered the philosophe
Whitnell; and what do you think his real name was? Only
'Whetenhall! Pray do you call cousins?(261)  Look in Collins's
Baronets, and under the article Bedingfield you will find that
he was an ingenious gentleman, and la blanche Whitnell, though
one of the greatest beauties of the age, an excellent wife.  I
am persuaded the Bedingfields crowded in these characters to
take off the ridicule in Grammont; they have succeeded to a
miracle.  Madame de Mirepoix told me t'other day, that she had
known a daughter of the Countess de Grammont, an Abbess in
Lorrain, who, to the ambassadress's great scandal, was ten
times more vain of the blood of Hamilton than of an equal
quantity of that of Grammont.  She had told her much of her
sister my Lady Stafford,(262) whom I remember to have seen when I
was a child.  She used to live at Twickenham when Lady Mary
Wortley(263) and the Duke of Wharton lived there; she had more
wit than both of them.  What would I give to have had Strawberry
Hill twenty years ago! I think any thing but twenty years.  Lady
Stafford used to say to her sister, "Well, child, I have come
without my wit to-day;" that is, she had not taken her opium,
which she was forced to do if she had any appointment, to be in
particular spirits.  This rage of Grammont carried me a little
while ago to old Marlborough's,(264) at Wimbledon, where I had
heard there was a picture of Lady Denham;(265) it is a charming
one.  The house you know stands in a hole, or, as the whimsical
old lady said, seems to be making a courtesy.  She had directed
my Lord Pembroke not to make her go up any steps; "I wont go up
steps;"--and so he dug a saucer to put it in, and levelled the
first floor with the ground.  There is a bust of Admiral
Vernon, erected I suppose by Jack Spencer, with as many lies
upon it as if it was a tombstone; and a very curious old
picture up-stairs that I take to be Louis Sforza the Moor, with
his nephew Galeazzo.  There are other good pictures in the
house, but perhaps you have seen them.  As I have formerly seen
Oxford and Blenheim, I did not stop till I came to
Stratford-upon-Avon, the wretchedest old town I ever saw, which
I intended for Shakspeare's sake, to find snug and pretty, and
antique, not old.  His tomb, and his wife's, and John Combes',
are in an agreeable church, with several other monuments; as
one of the Earl of Totness,(266) and another of Sir Edward
Walker, the memoirs writer.  There are quantities of Cloptons,
too but the bountiful corporation have exceedingly bepainted
Shakspeare and the principal personages.

I was much struck with Ragley; the situation is magnificent;
the house far beyond any thing I have seen of that bad age: for
it was begun, as I found by an old letter in the library from
Lord Ranelagh to Earl Conway, in the year 1680.  By the way, I
have had, and am to have, the rummaging of three chests of
pedigrees and letters to that secretary Conway, which I have
interceded for and saved from the flames.  The prospect is as
fine as one destitute of a navigated river can be, ind hitherto
totally unimproved; so is the house, which is but just covered
in, after so many years.  They have begun to inhabit the naked
walls of the attic story; the great one is unfloored and
unceited - the hall is magnificent, sixty by forty, and
thirty-eight high.  I am going to pump Mr. Bentley for designs.
The other apartments are very lofty, and in quantity, though I
had suspected that this leviathan hall must have devoured half
the other chambers.

The Hertfords carried me to dine at Lord Archer's,(267) an
odious place.  On my return, I saw Warwick, a pretty old town,
small, and thinly inhabited, in the form of a cross.  The
castle is enchanting; the view pleased me more than I can
express; the river Avon tumbles down a cascade at the foot of
it.  It is well laid out by one Brown(268 who has set up on a
few ideas of Kent and Mr. Southcote.  One sees what the
prevalence of taste does; little Brooke, who would have
chuckled to have been born in an age of clipt hedges and
cockle-shell avenues, has submitted to let his garden and park
be natural.  Where he has attempted Gothic in the castle, he
has failed; and has indulged himself in a new apartment, that
is paltry.  The chapel is very pretty, and smugged up with tiny
pews, that look like `etuis for the Earl and his diminutive
Countess.  I shall tell you nothing of the glorious chapel of
the Beauchamps in St. Mary's church, for you know it is in
Dugdale; nor how ill the fierce bears and ragged staves are
succeeded by puppets and corals.  As I came back another road,
I saw Lord Pomfret's,(269) by Towcester, where there are a few
good pictures, and many masked statues; there is an exceeding
fine Cicero, which has no fault, but the head being modern.  I
saw a pretty lodge. just built by the Duke of Grafton, in
Whittleberry-forest; the design is Kent's, but, as was his
manner, too heavy.  Iran through the gardens at Stowe, which I
have seen before, and had only time to be charmed with the
variety of scenes.  I do like that Albano glut of buildings,
let them be ever so much condemned.

(261) A sister of Mr.  Montagu's was married to Nathaniel
Whetenhall, Esq.

Earl of Stafford, and daughter of Philibert, Count of Grammont,

(265) Miss Brooke, one of the beauties of the court of Charles
II., second wife of Sir John Denham the poet.  This second
marriage brought upon him so much disquiet, as for a time to
disorder his understanding, and Butler lampooned him for his
lunacy.  In Grammont's Memoirs many circumstances are related,
both of his marriage and his frenzy, very little favourable to
his character.-E.

(266) George Carew, Earl of Totness, died without heirs male in
1629, leaving an only daughter, married to Sir Allen Apsley.-E.

his frequent use of that word.  He rose by his merit, from a
low condition, to be head gardener at Stowe; and was afterwards
appointed to the same situation at Hampton Court.  Lord
Chatham, who had a great regard for him, thus speaks of him, in
a letter to Lady Stanhope:--"The chapter of my friend's dignity
must not be omitted.  He writes Lancelot Brown, Esquire, en
titre d'affic: please to consider, he shares the private hours
of Majesty, dines familiarly with his neighbour of Sion, and
sits down to the tables of all the House of Lords, etc.  To be
serious, he is deserving of the regard shown to him; for I know
him, upon very long acquaintance to be an honest man, and of
sentiments much above his birth."  see Chatham Correspondence,
vol. iv. p. 430.-E.

112 letter 47
To Sir Horace Mann.
Mistley, Aug. 31, 1751.

I am going to answer two of your letters, without having the
fear of Genoa(270) before my eyes.  Your brother sent to me
about this embassy the night before I came out of town, and I
had not time nor opportunity to make any inquiry about it.
Indeed, I am persuaded it is all a fable, some political nonsense
of Richcourt.  How should his brother know any thing of it?  or,
to speak plainly, what can we bring about by a sudden negotiation
with the Genoese?  Do but put these two things together, that we
can do nothing, and the Richcourts can know nothing, and you will
laugh at this pretended communication of a secret that relates
to yourself' from one who is ignorant of what relates to you,
and who would not tell you if he did know.  I have had a note
from your brother since I came hither, which confirms my
opinion; and I find Mr. Chute is of the same.  Be at peace, my
dear child: I should not be so if I thought you in the least
danger.

I imagined you would have seen Mr. Conway before this time; I
have already told you how different you will find him from the
raw animals that you generally see.  As you talk of our
Beauties, I shall tell you a new story of the Gunnings, who
make more noise than any of their predecessors since the days
of Helen, though neither of them, nor any thing about them,
have yet been teterrima belli causa.  They went the other day
to see Hampton Court; as they were going Into the Beauty-room,
another company arrived; the housekeeper said, "This way,
ladies; here are the Beauties." The Gunnings flew into a
passion, and asked her what she meant; that they came to see
the palace, not to be showed as a sight themselves.

I am charmed with your behaviour to the Count on the affair of
the Leghorn allegiance; I don't wonder he is willing to
transport you to Genoa! Your priest's epigram is strong; I
suppose he had a dispensation for making a false quantity in
secunda.

Pray tell me if you know any thing of Lady Mary Wortley: we
have an obscure history here of her being in durance in the
Brescian, or the Bergamasco: that a young fellow whom she set
out with keeping has taken it into his head to keep her close
prisoner, not permitting her to write or receive any letters
but what he sees: he seems determined, if her husband should
die, not to lose her, as the Count lost my Lady Orford.(271)

Lord Rockingham told me himself of his Guercino, and seemed
obliged for the trouble you had given yourself in executing the
commission.  I can tell you nothing farther of the pictures at
Houghton; Lord Orford has been ill and given over, and is gone
to Cheltenham.

The affair of Miss Nicholl is blown up by the treachery of my
uncle Horace and some lawyers, that I had employed at his
recommendation.  I have been forced to write a narrative of the
whole transaction, and was with difficulty kept from publishing
it.  You shall see it whenever I have an opportunity.  Mr.
Chute, who has been still worse used than I have been, is,
however, in better spirits than he was, since he got rid of all
this embroil.  I have brought about a reconciliation with his
brother, which makes me less regard the other disappointments.
I must bid you good night, for I am at too great a distance to
know any news, even if there were any in season.  I shall be in
town next week, and will not fail you in inquiries, though I am
persuaded you will before that have found that all this Genoese
mystery was without foundation.  Adieu!

(270) Count Richcourt pretended that he had received
intelligence from his brother, then minister in London, that
Mr. Mann was to be sent on a secret commission to Genoa.

(271) Lord Wharncliffe, in his edition of Lady Mary's Works,
vol. iii. p. 435, makes the following observation on this
passage:--"Among Lady Mary's papers there is a long paper,
written in Italian, not by herself, giving an account of her
having been detained for some time against her will in a
country-house belonging to an Italian Count, and inhabited by
him and his mother.  This paper seems to have been submitted to
a lawyer for his opinion, or to be produced in a court of law.
There is nothing else to be found in Lady Mary's papers
referring in the least degree to this circumstance.  It would
appear, however, that some such forcible detention as is
alluded to did take place, probably for some pecuniary or
interested object; but, like many of Horace Walpole's stories,
he took care not to let this lose any thing that might give it
zest, and he therefore makes the person by whom Lady Mary was
detained a young fellow whom she set out with keeping.' Now, at
the time of this transaction, Lady Mary was sixty-one years
old.  The reader, therefore, may judge for himself, how far
such an imputation upon her is likely to be founded in
truth."-E.



114 Letter 48
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Oct. 8, 1751.

So you have totally forgot that I sent you the pedigree of the
Crouches, as long ago as the middle of last August, and that
you promised to come to Strawberry Hill in October.  I shall be
there some time in next week, but as my motions neither depend
on resolutions nor almanacs, let me know beforehand when you
intend to make me a visit; for though keeping an appointment is
not just the thing you ever do, I suppose you know you dislike
being disappointed yourself, as much as if you were the most
punctual person in the world to engagements.

I came yesterday from Woburn, where I have been a week.  The
house is in building, and three sides of the quadrangle
finished.  The park is very fine, the woods glorious, and the
plantations of evergreens sumptuous; but upon the whole, it is
rather -what I admire than like-I fear that is what I am a
little apt to do at the finest places in the world where there
is not a navigable river.  You would be charmed, as I was, with
an old gallery, that is not yet destroyed.  It is a bad room,
powdered with little gold stars, and covered with millions of
old portraits.  There are all the successions of Earls and
Countesses of Bedford, and all their progenies.  One countess
is a whole-length drawing in the drollest dress you ever saw; and
another picture of the same woman leaning on her hand, I
believe by Cornelius Johnson, is as fine a head as ever I saw.
There are many of Queen Elizabeth's worthies, the Leicesters,
Essexes, and Philip Sidneys, and a very curious portrait of the
last Courtney, Earl of Devonshire, who died at Padua.  Have not
I read somewhere that he was in love with Queen Elizabeth, and
Queen Mary -with him?  He is quite in the style of the former's
lovers, red-bearded, and not comely.  There is Essex's friend,
the Earl of Southampton; his son the Lord Treasurer; and Madame
l'Empoisonneuse,(273) that married Carr,(274) Earl of
Somerset--she is pretty.  Have not you seen a copy Vertue has
made of Philip and Mary? That is in this gallery too, but more
curious than good.  They showed me two heads, who, according to
the tradition of the family, were the originals of Castalio and
Polydore.  They were sons to the second Earl of Bedford; and the
eldest, if not both, died before their father.  The eldest has
vipers in his hand, and in the distant landscape appears in a
maze, with these words, Fata viam invenient.  The other has a
woman behind him, sitting near the sea, with strange monsters
surrounding her.  I don't pretend to decipher this, nor to
describe half the entertaining morsels I found here; but I can't
omit, as you know I am Grammont-mad, that I found "le vieux
Roussel, qui `etoit le plus fier danseur d'Angleterre."  The
portrait is young, but has all the promise of his latter
character.  I am going to send them a head of a Countess of
Cumberland,(275) sister to Castalio and Polydore, and mother of a
famous Countess of Dorset,(276) who Afterwards married the Earl
of Pembroke,(277) of Charles the First's time.  She was an
authoress, and immensely rich.  After the restoration, Sir
Joseph Williamson, the secretary of state, wrote to her to
choose a courtier at Appleby: she sent him this answer: "I have
been bullied by an usurper, I have been ill-treated by a court,
but I won't be dictated to by a subject; your man shall not
stand.  Ann Dorset, Pembroke and Montgomery."  Adieu! If you
love news a hundred years old, I think you can't have a better
correspondent.  For any thing that passes now, I shall not
think it worth knowing these fifty years.

(273 Lady Frances Howard, daughter of the Earl of Suffolk, and
married to the Earl of Essex, from whom she was divorced.  She
then married her lover, the Earl of Somerset.  She poisoned Sir
Thomas Overbury, because he had endeavoured to dissuade his
friend the Earl of Somerset from this alliance.  She was tried
and condemned, but was pardoned by King James.

(274) Robert Carr, a favourite of King James the First, who
created him Viscount Rochester and Earl of Somerset.  He was
tried and condemned, but was pardoned by James the First.

(275) Margaret, Countess of Cumberland, daughter of Francis
Russell, second Earl of Bedford, and married to George
Clifford, third Earl of Cumberland.

(276)) Ann Clifford, daughter of George, Earl of Cumberland,
first married to Richard Sackville, Earl of Dorset, and
afterwards to Philip, Earl of Pembroke.

(277) Philip, Earl of Pembroke, son of Henry, second Earl of
Pembroke.  He was chamberlain to Charles the First.



115 Letter 49
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 14, 1751.

It is above six weeks since I wrote to you, and I was going on
to be longer, as I stayed for something to tell you; but an
express that arrived yesterday brought a great event, which,
though you will hear long before my letter can arrive, serves
for a topic to renew our correspondence.  The Prince of Orange
is dead: killed by the waters of Aix-la-Chapelle.  This is all I
yet know.  I shall go to town to-morrow for a day or two, and if
I pick up any particulars before the post goes away, you shall
know them.  The Princess Royal(278) was established Regent some
time ago; but as her husband's authority seemed extremely
tottering, it is not likely that she will be able to maintain
hers.  Her health is extremely bad, and her temper neither
ingratiating nor bending.  It is become the peculiarity of the
House of Orange to have minorities.

Your last letter to me of Sept. 24th, and all I have seen since
your first fright, make me easy about your Genoese journey.  I
take no honour from the completion of my prophecy; it was
sufficient to know circumstances and the trifling falsehood of
Richcourt, to confirm me in my belief that that embassy was
never intended.  We dispose of Corsica! Alas! I believe there
is but one island that we shall ever have power to give away;
and that is Great Britain--and I don't know but we may exert
our power.

You are exceedingly kind about Mr. Conway-but when are not you
so to me and my friends? I have just received a miserable
letter from him on his disappointment; he had waited for a
man-of-war to embark for Leghorn; it came in the night, left
its name upon a card, and was gone before he was awake in the
morning, and had any notice of it.  He still talks of seeing
you; as the Parliament is to meet so soon, I should think he
will scarce have time, though I don't hear that he is sent for,
or that they will have occasion to send for any body, unless
they want to make an Opposition.

We were going to have festivals and masquerades for the birth
of the Duke of Burgundy, but I suppose both they and the
observance of the King's birthday will be laid aside or
postponed, on the death of our son-in-law.  Madame de Mirepoix
would not stay to preside at her own banquets, but is slipped
away to retake possession of the tabouret.  When the King
wished her husband joy, my Lady Pembroke(279) was standing near
him; she was a favourite, but has disgraced herself by marrying
a Captain Barnard.  Mirepoix said, as he had no children he was
indifferent to the honour of a duchy for himself, but was glad
it would restore Madame to the honour she had lost by marrying
him! "Oh!" replied the King, ,you are of so great a family, the
rank was nothing; but I can't bear when women of quality marry
one don't know whom!"

Did you ever receive the questions I asked you about Lady Mary
Wortley's being confined by a lover that she keeps somewhere in
the Brescian?  I long to know the particulars.  I have lately
been at Woburn, where the Duchess of Bedford borrowed for me
from a niece of Lady Mary about fifty letters of the latter.
They are charming! have more spirit and vivacity than you can
conceive, and as much of the spirit of debauchery in them as
you will conceive in her writing.  They were written to her
sister, the unfortunate Lady Mar, whom she treated so hardly
while out of her senses, which she has not entirely recovered,
though delivered and tended with the greatest tenderness and
affection by her daughter, Lady Margaret Erskine: they live in
a house lent to them by the Duke of Bedford; the Duchess is
Lady Mary's niece.(280)  Ten of the letters, indeed, are dismal
lamentations and frights of a scene of villany of Lady Mary,
who, having persuaded one Ruremonde, a Frenchman and her lover,
to entrust her with a large sum of money to buy stock for him,
frightened him out of England, by persuading him that Mr.
Wortley had discovered the intrigue, and would murder him; and
then would have sunk the trust.  That not succeeding, and he
threatening to print her letters, she endeavoured to make Lord
Mar or Lord Stair cut his throat.  Pope hints at these
anecdotes of her history in that line,

"Who starves a sister or denies a debt."(281)

In one of her letters she says, "We all partake of father
Adam's folly and knavery, who first eat the apple like a sot,
and then turned informer like a scoundrel."  This is character,
at least, if not very delicate; but in most of them, the wit
and style are superior to any letters I ever read but Madame
Sevign`e's.  It is very remarkable, how much better women write
than men.  I have now before me a volume of letters written by
the widow(282) of the beheaded Lord Russel, which are full of
the most moving and expressive eloquence ; I want to persuade
the Duke of Bedford to let them be printed.(283)

17th.--I have learned nothing but that the Prince of Orange
died of an imposthume in his head.  Lord Holderness is gone to
Holland to-day--I believe rather to learn than to teach.  I have
received yours of Oct. 8, and don't credit a word of
Birtle's(284) information.  Adieu!

(276) Anne, eldest daughter of George the Second.  Walpole, in
his Memoires, vol. i. p. 173, describes her as being
immoderately jealous and fond of her husband : "Yet," adds he,
"this Mars, who was locked in the arms of that Venus, was a
monster so deformed, that when the King had chosen him for his
son-in-law, he could not help, in the honesty of his heart and
the coarseness of his expression, telling the Princess how
hideous a bridegroom she was to expect; and even gave her
permission to refuse him: she replied, she would marry him if
he was a baboon; "Well, then," said the King, "there is baboon
enough for you!"-E.

(279) Mary, daughter of the Viscount Fitzwilliam, formerly maid
of honour to the Queen, and widow of Henry Herbert, Earl of
Pembroke. [In the preceding month, Lady Pembroke had married
North Ludlow Barnard, a major of dragoons.  She died in 1769.]

(280) Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Lady Mar, and the first wife
of John, Lord Gower, were daughters of Evelyn Pierpoint, Duke
of Kingston.

(281) Upon this passage Lord Wharncliffe observes, that
"nothing whatever has been found to throw light upon the ill
treatment of Lady Mar by Lady Mary, and that accusation is
supposed, by those who would probably have heard of it if true,
to be without foundation."  Nine of the ten letters spoken of
by Walpole, are given in his lordship's edition of Lady Mary's
Works; and, in the opinion of the Quarterly Reviewer, "they
confirm, in a very extraordinary way, Horace Walpole's
impression." See vol. viii. p. 191.-E.

(282) @Rachel, daughter of Thomas Wriothesley, Earl of
Southampton, lord treasurer.  One of these letters to Dr.
Tillotson, to persuade him to accept the archbishopric, has
been since printed, and a fragment of another of her letters,
in Birch's Life of that prelate.

(283) They were published in 1773, and met with such deserved
success as to call for a Seventh edition of them in 1809.  In
1819, appeared a quarto volume, entitled "Some Account of the
Life of Rachael Wriothesley, Lady Russell, with Letters from
Lady Russell to her husband Lord Russell," by the editor of
Madame du Deffand's Letters.-E.

(284) Consul at Genoa: he had heard the report of Mr. Mann's
being designed for an embassy to Genoa.



118 Letter 50
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 22, 1751.

As the Parliament is met, you will, of course, expect to hear
something of it: the only thing to be told of it is, what I
believe was never yet to be told of an English Parliament, that
it is so unanimous, that we are not likely to have one division
this session-Day, I think not a debate.(285)  On the Address,
Sir John Cotton alone said a few words against a few words of
it.  Yesterday, on a motion to resume the sentences against
Murray, who is fled to France, only two persons objected--in
short, we shall not be more a French Parliament when we are
under French government.  Indeed, the two nations seem to have
crossed over and figured in; one hears of nothing from Paris
but gunpowder plots in a Duke of Burgundy's cradle (whom the
clergy, by a vice versa, have converted into a Pretender,) and
menaces of assassinations.  Have you seen the following verses,
that have been stuck up on the Louvre, the Pontneuf, and other
places?

"Deux Henris immol`es par nos braves Ayeux,
L'un `a la Libert`e et l'autre `a nos Dieux,
Nous animent, Louis, aux m`emes entreprises:
Ils revivent, en Toi ces anciens Tyrans:
Crains notre desespoir: La Noblesse a des Guises,
Paris des Ravaillacs, le Clerg`e des Clements."

Did you ever see more ecclesiastic fury?  Don't you like their
avowing the cause of Jacques Clement?'and that Henry IV. was
sacrificed to a plurality of gods! a frank confession! though
drawn from the author by the rhyme, as Cardinal Bembo, to write
classic Latin, used to say, Deos immortales!  But what most
offends me is the threat of murder: it attaints the prerogative
of chopping off the heads of Kings in a legal way.  We here
have been still more interested about a private history that
has lately happened at Paris.  It seems uncertain by your
accounts whether Lady Mary Wortley is in voluntary or
constrained durance - it is not at all equivocal that her son
and a Mr. Taaffe have been in the latter at Fort LEvesque and
the Chatelet.(286)  All the letters from Paris have been very
cautious of relating the circumstances.  The outlines are, that
these two gentlemen, who were pharaoh-bankers to Madame de
Mirepoix, had travelled to France to exercise the same
profession, where it is suppose(] they cheated a Jew, who would
afterwards have cheated them of the money he owed; and that. to
secure payment, they broke open his lodgings and bureau, and
seized jewels and other effects; that he accused them; that they
were taken out of their beds at two o'clock in the morning, kept
in different prisons, without fire or candle, for six-and-thirty
hours; have since been released on excessive bail; are still to
be tried, may be sent to the galleys, or dismissed home, where
they will be reduced to keep the best company; for I suppose
nobody else will converse with them.  Their separate anecdotes
are curious: Wortley, you know, has been a perfect Gil Blas, and,
for one of his last adventures; is thought to have added the
famous Miss Ashe to the number of his wives.  Taaffe is an
Irishman, who changed his religion to fight a duel; as you know
in Ireland a Catholic may not wear a sword.  He is a gamester,
usurer, adventurer, and of late has divided his attentions
between the Duke of Newcastle and Madame Pompadour; travelling,
with turtles and pine-apples, in postchaises, to the
latter,-flying back to the former for Lewes races--and smuggling
burgundy at the same time.  I shall finish their history with a
bon-mot.  The Speaker was railing at gaming and White's, apropos
to these two prisoners.  Lord Coke, to whom the conversation was
addressed, replied, "Sir, all I can say is, that they are both
members of the House of Commons, and neither of them of
White's."  Monsieur de Mirepoix sent a card lately to White's,
to invite all the chess-players of both 'clamps'.  Do but think
what a genius a man must have, or, my dear child, do you
consider what information you would be capable of sending to
your court, if, after passing two years in a country, you had
learned but the two first letters of"a word, that you heard
twenty times every day!  I have a bit of paper left, so I will
tell you another story.  A certain King, that, whatever airs
you may give yourself, you are not at all like, was last week
at the play.  The Intriguing Chambermaid in the farce(287) says
to the old gentleman, "You are villanously old; you are
sixty-six; you can't have the impudence to think of living
above two years."  The old gentleman in the stage-box turned
about in a passion, and said, "This is d-d stuff!"  Pray have
you got Mr. Conway yet! Adieu!

(285) "Nov. 14 Parliament opened.  Lord Downe and Sir William
Beauchamp Proctor moved and seconded the Address.  No
opposition to it." Dodington, p. 114.  Tindal says that this
session was, perhaps, the most unanimous ever known."-E.

(286) See ant`e.-E.

(287) The Intriguing Chambermaid was performed at Drury-lane on
the 6th of November; it was dedicated by Fielding to Mrs.
Clive.-E.



119 Letter 51
To Sir Horace Mann.
Dec. 12, 1751.

I have received yours and Mr. Conway's letters, and am
transported that you have met at last, and that you answer so
well to one another, as I intended.  I expect that you tell me
more and more all that you think of him.  The inclosed is for
him; as he has never received one of my letters since he left
England, I have exhausted all my news upon him, and for this post
you must only go halves with him, who I trust is still at
Florence.  In your last, you mentioned Lord Stormont, and commend
him; pray tell me more about him.  He is cried up above all the
young men of the time-in truth we want recruits! Lord Bolingbroke
is dead, or dying,(288) of a cancer, which was thought cured by a
quack plaster; but it is not every body can be cured at
seventy-five, like my monstrous uncle.

What is an uomo nero?-neither Mr. Chute nor I can recollect the
term.  Though you are in the season of the villegiatura,
believe me, Mr. Conway will not find Florence duller than he
would London: our diversions, politics, quarrels, are buried
all in our Alphonso's grave!(289)  The only thing talked of is
a man who draws teeth with a sixpence, and puts them in again
for a shilling.  I believe it; not that it seems probable, but
because I have long been persuaded that the most incredible
discoveries will be made, and that, about the time, or a little
after, I die, the secret will be found out of how to live for
ever--and that secret, I believe, will not be discovered by a
physician.  Adieu!

P. S. I have tipped Mr. Conway's direction with French, in case
it should be necessary to send it after him.

120 Letter 52
To George Montagu, Esq.
THE ST.  JAMES'S EVENING POST.
Thursday, Jan. 9, 1752.

Monday being the Twelfth-day, his Majesty according to annual
custom offered myrrh, frankincense, and a small bit of gold;
and at night, in commemoration of the three kings or wise men,
the King and Royal Family played a@ hazard for the benefit of a
prince of the blood.  There were above eleven thousand pounds
upon the table; his most sacred Majesty won three guineas, and
his Royal Highness the Duke three thousand four hundred pounds.

On Saturday was landed at the Custom-house a large box of
truffles, being a present to the Earl of Lincoln from Theobald
Taaffe, Esq. who is shortly expected home from his travels in
foreign parts.

To-morrow the new-born son of the Earl of Egremont is to be
baptized, when his Majesty, and the Earl of Granville (if he is
able to stand), and the Duchess of Somerset, are to be
sponsors.

We are assured that on Tuesday last, the surprising strong
woman was exhibited at the Countess of Holderness's, before a
polite assembly of persons of the first quality; and some time
this week, the two dwarfs will play at brag at Madame Holman's.
N.B. The strong man, who was to have performed at Mrs. Nugent's,
is indisposed.  There is lately arrived at the Lord Carpenter's,
a curious male chimpanzee, which had had the honour of being
shown before the ugliest princes in Europe, who all expressed
their approbation; and we hear that he intends to offer himself a
candidate to represent the city of Westminster at the next
general election.  Note: he wears breeches, and there is a
gentlewoman to attend the ladies.'

Last night the Hon. and Rev.  Mr. James Brudenel was admitted a
doctor of opium in the ancient UNIVERSITY of White's, being
received ad eundem by his grace the Rev. father in chess the
Duke of Devonshire, president, and the rest of the senior
fellows.  At the same time the Lord Robert Bertie and Colonel
Barrington were rejected, on account of some deficiency of
formality in their testimonials.

Letters from Grosvenor Street mention a dreadful apparition,
which has appeared for several nights at the house of the
Countess Temple, which has occasioned several of her ladyship's
domestics to leave her service, except the coachman, who has
drove her sons and nephews for several years, and is not afraid
of spectres.  The coroner's inquest have brought in their
verdict lunacy.

Last week the Lord Downe received at the treasury the sum of a
hundred kisses from the Auditor of the Exchequer, being the
reward for shooting at a highwayman.

On Tuesday the operation of shaving was happily performed on
the upper lip of her grace the Duchess of Newcastle, by a
celebrated artist from Paris, sent over on purpose by the Earl
of Albemarle.  The performance lasted but one minute and three
seconds, to the great joy of that noble family; and in
consideration of his great care and expedition, his grace has
settled four hundred pounds a year upon him for life.  We hear
that he is to have the honour of shaving the heads of the Lady
Caroline Petersham, the Duchess of Queensberry, and several
other persons of quality.

By authority, on Sunday next will be opened the Romish chapel
at Norfolk House; no persons will be admitted but such as are
known well-wishers to the present happy establishment.  Mass
will begin exactly when the English liturgy is finished.

At the theatre royal in the House of Lords, the Royal Slave,
with Lethe.  At the theatre in St. Stephen's chapel, the Fool
in Fashion.

The Jews are desired to meet on the 20th inst. at the sign of
Fort L'Evesque in Pharaoh Street, to commemorate the noble
struggle made by one of their brethren in support of his
property.

122 Letter 53
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 2, 1752.

We are much surprised by two letters which my Lady Aylesbury
has received from Mr. Conway, to find that he had not yet heard
of his new regiment.  She, who is extremely reasonable, seems
content that he went to Rome before he got the news, as it
would have been pity to have missed such an opportunity of
seeing it, and she flatters herself that he would have set out
immediately for England, if he had received the express -at
Florence.  Now you know him, and you will not wonder that she
is impatient; you would wonder, if you knew her, if he were not
so too.

After all I have lately told you of our dead tranquillity, You
will be surprised to hear of an episode of Opposition: it is
merely an interlude, for at least till next @ear we shall have
no more: you will rather think it a farce, when I tell you,
that that buffoon my old uncle acted a principal part in it.
And what made it more ridiculous, the title of the drama was a
subsidiary treaty with Saxony.(291)  In short, being impatient
with the thought that he should die without having it written
on his tomb, "He-re lies Baron Punch," he spirited up--whom do
you think?--only a Grenville! my Lord Cobham, to join with him
in speaking against this treaty: both did: the latter retired
after his speech; but my uncle concluded his (which was a
direct answer to all he has been making all his life,) with
declaring, that he should yet vote for the treaty!  You never
heard such a shout and laughter as it caused.  This debate was
followed by as new a one in, the House of Lords, where the Duke
of Bedford took the treaty, and in the conclusion of his
speech, the ministry, to pieces.  His friend Lord Sandwich, by
a most inconceivable jumble of cunning, spoke for the treaty,
against the ministry; it is supposed, lest the 'Duke should be
thought to have countenanced the Opposition: you never heard a
more lamentable performance! there was no division.(292)  The
next day the Tories in our House moved for a resolution against
subsidiary treaties in line of peace: Mr. Pelham, with great
agitation, replied to the philippics of the preceding, day, and
divided 180 to 52.

There has been an odd sort of codicil to these debates:
Vernon,(293) a very inoffensive, good-humoured young fellow,
who lives in the strongest intimacy with all the fashionable
young men, was proposed for the Old Club at White's, into the
mysteries of which, before a person is initiated, it is
necessary that he should be well with the ruling powers:
unluckily, Vernon has lately been at Woburn with the Duke of
Bedford.  The night of' the ballot, of twelve persons present,
eight had promised him white balls, being his particular
friends--however, there were six black balls!-this made great
noise--his friends found it necessary to clear up their faith
to him--ten of the twelve assured him upon their honour that
they had given him white balls.  I fear this will not give you
too favourable an idea of the honour of the young men of the
age!

Your father, who has been dying, and had tasted nothing but
water for ten days, the other day called for roast beef, and is
well; cured, I suppose, by this abstinence, which convinces me
that intemperance has been his illness.  Fasting and
mortification will restore a good constitution, but not correct
a bad one.

Adieu! I write you but short letters, and those, I fear,
seldom; but they tell you all that is material; this is not an
age to furnish volumes.

(291) Mr. Pitt was so much pleased with Mr. Horatio Walpole's
speech on this occasion that he requested him to consign it to
writing, and gave it as his opinion, that it contained much
weighty matter, and from beginning to end breathed the spirit
of a man who loved his country.  See Chatham Correspondence,
vol. i. p. 63.-E.

(292) For an account of this d(@bate, taken by Lord Chancellor
Hardwicke, see Parl. Hist. vol. xiv. p. 1175.-E.

widow of the Earl of Upper Ossory, and sister of Gertrude,
Duchess of Bedford.-D.



123 Letter 54
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 27, 1752.

Gal. tells me that your eldest brother has written you an
account of your affairs, the particulars of which I was most
solicitous to learn, and am now most unhappy to find no
better.(294)  Indeed, Gal. would have most reason to complain,
if his strong friendship for you did not prevent him from
thinking that nothing is hard that is in your favour; he told
me himself that the conditions imposed upon him were inferior
to what he always proposed to do, if the misfortune should
arrive of your recall.  He certainly loves you earnestly; if I
were not convinced of it, I should be far from loving him so
well as I do.

I write this as a sort of letter of form on the occasion, for
there is nothing worth telling you.  The event that has made
most noise since my last, is the extempore wedding of the
youngest of the two Gunnings, who have made so vehement a
noise.  Lord Coventry,(295) a grave young lord, of the remains
of the patriot breed, has long dangled after the eldest,
virtuously with regard to her virtue, not
very honourably with regard to his own credit.  About six weeks
ago Duke Hamilton,(296) the very reverse of the Earl, hot,
debauched, extravagant, and equally damaged in his fortune and
person, fell in love with the youngest at the masquerade, and
determined to marry her in the spring.  About a fortnight
since, at an immense assembly at my Lord Chesterfield's, made
to show the house, which is really magnificent, Duke Hamilton
made violent love at one end of the room, while he was playing
at pharaoh at the other end; that is, he saw neither the bank
nor his own cards, which were of three hundred pounds each: he
soon lost a thousand.  I own I was so little a professor in
love, that I thought all this parade looked ill for the poor
girl; and could not conceive, if he was so much engaged with
his mistress as to disregard such sums, why he played at all.
However, two nights afterwards, being left alone with her while
her mother and sister were at Bedford House, he found himself
so impatient, that he sent for a parson.  The doctor refused to
perform the ceremony without license or ring: the Duke swore he
would send for the Archbishop--at last they were married with a
ring of the bed-curtain, at half an hour after twelve at night,
at Mayfair chapel,(297)  The Scotch are enraged; the women mad
that so much beauty has had its effect; and what is most silly,
my Lord Coventry declares that he now will marry the other.

Poor Lord Lempster has just killed an officer(298) in a duel,
about a play-debt, and I fear was in the wrong.  There is no
end of his misfortunes and wrong-headedness!--Where is Mr.
Conway!--Adieu!

(294) Mr. Mann's father was just dead.

124 Letter 55
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 23, 1752.

Mr. Conway has been arrived this fortnight, or a week sooner
than we expected him: but my Lady Ailesbury forgives it! He is
full of your praises, so you have not sowed your goodness in
unthankful ground.  By a letter I have just received from you
he finds you have missed some from him with Commissions; but he
will tell you about them himself I find him much leaner, and
great cracks in his beauty.  Your picture is arrived, which he
says is extremely like you.  Mr. Chute cannot bear it; says it
wants your countenance and goodness; that it looks bonny and
Irish.  I am between both, and should know it; to be sure,
there is none of your wet-brown-paperness in it, but it has a
look with which I have known you come out of your little room,
when Richcourt has raised your ministerial French, and
you have writ to England about it till you were half fuddled.
Au reste, it is gloriously coloured--will Astley promise to
continue to do as well? or has he, like all other English
painters, only laboured this to get reputation, and then
intends to daub away to get money?

The year has not kept the promise of tranquillity that it made
you at Christmas; there has been another parliamentary bustle.
The Duke of Argyll(299) has drawn the ministry into
accommodating him with a notable job, under the notion of
buying for the King from the mortgagees the forfeited estates
in Scotland, which are to be colonized and civilized.  It
passed with some inconsiderable hitches through the Commons;
but in the Lords last week the Duke of Bedford took it up
warmly, and spoke like another Pitt.(300)  He attacked the Duke
of Argyll on favouring Jacobites, and produced some flagrant
instances, which the Scotch Duke neither answered nor
endeavoured to excuse, but made a strange, hurt, mysterious,
contemptuous, incoherent speech, neither in defence of the bill
nor in reply to the Duke of Bedford, but to my Lord Bath, who
had fallen upon the ministry for assuming a dispensing power,
in suffering Scotland to pay no taxes for the last five years.
This speech, which formerly would have made the House of
Commons take up arms, was strangely flat and unanimated, for
want of his old chorus.  Twelve lords divided against eighty
that were for the bill.  The Duke, who was present, would not
vote; none of his people had attended the bill in the other
House, and General Mordaunt (by his orders, as it is imagined)
spoke against it.  This concludes the session: the King goes to
Hanover on Tuesday, he has been scattering ribands of all
colours, blue ones on Prince Edward, the young Stadtholder, and
the Earls of Lincoln, Winchilsea, and Cardigan;(301) a green
one on Lord Dumfries;(302) a red on Lord Onslow.(303)

The world is still mad about the Gunnings; the Duchess of
Hamilton was presented on Friday; the crowd was so great, that
even the noble mob in the drawing-room clambered upon chairs
and tables to look at her.  There are mobs at their doors to
see them get into their chairs; and people go early to get
places at the theatres when it is known they will be there.
Dr. Sacheverel never made more noise than these two beauties.

There are two wretched women that just now are as much talked
of, a Miss Jefferies and a Miss Blandy; the one condemned for
murdering her uncle, the other her father.  Both their stories
have horrid circumstances; the first, having been debauched by
her uncle; the other had so tender a parent, that his whole
concern while he was expiring, and knew her for his murderess,
was to save her life.  It is shocking to think what a shambles
this country is grown!  Seventeen were executed this morning,
after having murdered the turnkey on Friday night, and almost
forced open Newgate.  One is forced to travel, even at noon, as
if one was going to battle.

Mr. Chute is as much yours as ever, except in the article of
pen and ink.  Your brother transacts all he can for the Lucchi,
as he has much more weight there(304) than Mr. Chute.  Adieu!

(299) Archibald Campbell, Duke of argyll, formerly Earl of
Isla.

126 Letter 56
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(305)
Arlington Street, May 5, 1752.

I now entirely credit all that my Lord Leicester and his family
have said against Lady Mary Coke and her family; and am
convinced that it is impossible to marry any thing of the blood
of Campbell, without having all her relations in arms to
procure a separation immediately.  Pray, what have I done? have
I come home drunk to my wife within these four first days? or
have I sat up gaming all night, and not come home at all to
her, after her lady-mother had been persuaded that I was the
soberest young nobleman in England, and had the greatest
aversion to play'! Have I kept my bride awake all night with
railing at her father, when all the world had allowed him to be
one of the bravest officers in Europe? In short, in short, I
have a mind to take COUNSEL, even of the wisest lawyer now
living in matrimonial cases, my Lord Coke * * *  If, like other
Norfolk husbands, I must entertain the town with a formal
parting, at least it shall be in my own way: my wife shall
neither 'run to Italy after lovers and books,(306) nor keep a
dormitory in her dressing-room at Whitehall for Westminster
schoolboys, your Frederick Campbells, and such like. (307) nor
'yet shall she reside at her mother's house, but shall
absolutely set out for Strawberry Hill in two or three days, as
soon as her room can be well aired; for, to give her her due, I
don't think her to blame, but flatter myself she is quite
contented with the easy footing we live upon; separate beds,
dining in her dressing-room when she is out of humour, and a
little toad-eater that I had got for her, and whose pockets and
bosom I have never examined, to see if' she brought any
billets-doux from Tommy Lyttelton or any of her fellows.  I
shall follow her myself in less than a fortnight; and if her
family don't give me any more trouble,-why, who knows but at
your return you may find your daughter with qualms and in a
sack?  If you should happen to want to know any more
particulars, she is quite well, has walked in the park every
morning, or has the chariot, as she chooses; and, in short, one
would think that I or she were much older than we really are, for
I grow excessively fond of her.(308)

(305) Now first published.

(306) Alluding to the wife of his eldest brother, Lord Walpole,
Margaret Rolle, who had separated Herself from her husband, and
resided in Italy.--E.

(307) Lady Townshend.-E.

(308) All this letter refers to Ann Seymour Conway, then three
years old, who had been left with her nurse at Mr. Walpole's,
during an absence of her father and mother in Ireland.-E.



127 Letter 57
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 12, 1752.

You deserve no charity, for you never write but to ask it.
When you are tired of yourself and the country, you think over
all London, and consider who will be proper to send you an
account of it.  Take notice, I won't be your gazetteer; nor is
my time come for being a dowager, a maker of news, a
day-labourer in scandal.  If you care for nobody but for what
they can tell you, you must provide yourself elsewhere.  The
town is empty, nothing in it but flabby mackerel, and wooden
gooseberry tarts, and a hazy east wind.  My sister is gone to
Paris; I go to Strawberry Hill in three days for the summer, if
summer there will ever be any.

If you want news you must send to Ireland, where there is
almost a civil war, between the Lord Lieutenant and Primate on
one side (observe, I don't tell you what that side is), and the
Speaker on the other, who carries questions by wholesale in the
House of Commons against the Castle; and the teterrima belli
causa is not the common one.

Reams of scandalous verses and ballads are come over, too bad
to send you, if I had them, but I really have not.  What is
more provoking for the Duke of Dorset, an address is come over
directly to the King (not as usual through the channel of the
Lord Lieutenant), to assure him of their great loyalty, and
apprehensions of being misrepresented.  This is all I know, and
you see, most imperfectly.

I was t'other night to see what is now grown the fashion,
Mother Midnight's Oratory.(309)  It appeared the lowest
buffoonery in the world even to me, who am used to my uncle
Horace.  There is a bad oration to ridicule, what it is too
like, Orator Henley; all the rest is perverted music: there is
a man who plays so nimbly on the kettle-drum, that he has
reduced that noisy instrument to an object of sight; for, if
you don't see the tricks with his hands, it is no better than
ordinary: another plays on a violin and trumpet together:
another mimics a bagpipe with a German flute, and makes it full
as disagreeable.  There is an admired dulcimer, a favourite
salt-box, and a really curious jew's-harp.  Two or three men
intend to persuade you that they play on a broomstick, which is
drolly brought in, carefully shrouded in a case, so as to be
mistaken for a bassoon or bass-viol; but they succeed in nothing
but the action. The last fellow imitates * * * * * curtseying to
a French horn.  There are twenty medley overtures, and a man who
speaks a prologue and an epilogue, in which he counterfeits all
the actors and singers upon earth: in short, I have long been
convinced, that what I used to imagine the most difficult thing
in the world, mimicry, is the easiest; for one has seen for
these two or three years, at Foote's and the other theatres,
that when they lost one mimic, they called ,Odd man!" and
another came and succeeded just as well.

Adieu! I have told you much more than I intended, and much more
than I could conceive I had to say, except how does Miss
Montagu?

P. S. Did you hear Captain Hotham's bon-mot on Sir Thomas
Robinson's making an assembly from the top of his house to the
bottom?  He said, he wondered so many people would go to Sir
Thomas's, as he treated them all de haut en bas.

(309) "Among other diversions and amusements which increase
upon us, the town," says the Gentleman's Magazine for January
1752, "has been lately entertained with a kind of farcical
performance, called 'The Old Woman's Oratory,' conducted by
Mrs. Mary Midnight and her family, intended as a banter on
Henley's Oratory, and a puff for the Old Woman's Magazine."-E.



128 Letter 58
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 13, 1752.

By this time you know my way, how much my letters grow out of
season, as it grows summer.  I believe it is six weeks since I
wrote to you last; but there is not only the usual deadness of
summer to account for my silence; England itself is no longer
England.  News, madness, parties, whims, and twenty other
causes, that used to produce perpetual events are at an end;
Florence itself is not more inactive.  Politics,

"Like arts and sciences are travelled west."

They are cot into Ireland, where there is as much bustle to
carry a question in the House of Commons, as ever it was here
in any year forty-one.  Not that there is any opposition to the
King's measures; out of three hundred members, there has never
yet been a division of above twenty-eight against the
government: they are much the most zealous subjects the king
has.  The Duke of Dorset has had the art to make them
distinguish between loyalty and aversion to the Lord
Lieutenant.

I last night received yours of May 5th; but I cannot deliver
your expressions to Mr. Conway, for he and Lady Ailesbury are
gone to his regiment in Ireland for four months, which is a
little rigorous, not only after an exile in Minorca, but more
especially unpleasant now as they have just bought one of the
most charming 'places in England, Park-place, which belonged to
Lady Archibald Hamilton, and then to the Prince.  You have seen
enough of Mr. Conway to judge how patiently he submits to his
duty.  Their little girl is left with me.

The Gunnings are gone to their several castles, and one hears
no more of them, except that such crowds flock to see the
Duchess Hamilton pass, that seven hundred people sat up all
night in and about an inn in Yorkshire to see her get into her
postchaise next morning.

I saw lately at Mr. Barret's a print of Valombrosa, which I
should be glad to have, if you please; though I don't think it
gives much idea of the beauty of the place: but you know what a
passion there is for it in England, as Milton has mentioned it.

Miss Blandy died with a coolness of courage that is
astonishing, and denying the fact,(310) which has made a kind
of party in her favour as if a woman who would not stick at
parricide, would scruple a lie!

We have made a law for immediate execution on conviction of
murder: it will appear extraordinary to me if it has any
effect;(311) for I can't help believing that the terrible part
of death must be the preparation for it.

(310) Miss Blandy was executed at Oxford, on the 6th of April,
"I am perfectly innocent," she exclaimed, "of any intention to
destroy or even hurt my dear father; so help me God in these my
last moments!"-E.

(311) Smollett, on the contrary, was of opinion that the
expedient had been productive of very good effects.-E.



129 Letter 59
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, June 6, 1752.

I have just been in London for two or three days, to fetch an
adventure, and am returned to my hill and castle.  I can't say
I lost my labour, as you shall hear.  Last Sunday night, being
as wet a night as you shall see in a summer's day, about half
an hour after twelve, I was just come home from White's, and
undressing to step into bed, I heard Harry, who you know lies
forwards, roar out, "Stop thief!" and run down stairs.  I ran
after him.  Don't be frightened; I have not lost one enamel,
nor bronze, nor have been shot through the head again.  A
gentlewoman, who lives at Governor Pitt's,(312) next door but
one to me, and where Mr. Bentley used to live, was going to bed
too, and heard people breaking into Mr. Freeman's house, who,
like some acquaintance of mine in Albemarle-street, goes out of
town, locks up his doors, and leaves the community to watch his
furniture.  N. B. It was broken open but two years ago, and all
the chairmen vow they shall steal his house away another time,
before we shall trouble our heads about it.  Well, madam called
out "watch;" two men who were centinels, ran away, and Harry's
voice after them.  Down came I, and with a posse of chairmen
and watchmen found the third fellow in the area of Mr. Freeman's
house.  Mayhap you have seen all this in the papers, little
thinking who commanded the detachment.  Harry fetched a
blunderbuss to invite the thief up.  One of the chairmen, who
was drunk, cried, "Give me the blunderbuss, I'll shoot him!"
But as the general's head was a little cooler, he prevented
military execution, and took the prisoner without bloodshed,
intending to make his triumphal entry into the metropolis of
Twickenham with his captive tied to the wheels of his
postchaise.  I find my style rises so much with the
recollection of my victory, that I don't know how to descend to
tell you that the enemy was a carpenter, and had a leather
apron on. The next step was to share my glory with my friends.
I despatched a courier to White's for George Selwyn, who you
know, loves nothing upon earth so well as a criminal, except
the execution of him.  It happened very luckily, that the
drawer, who received my message, has very lately been robbed
himself, and had the wound fresh in his memory.  He stalked up
into the club-room, stopped short, and with a hollow trembling
voice said, "Mr. Selwyn! Mr. Walpole's compliments to you, and
he has got a house-breaker for you!"  A squadron immediately
came to reinforce me, and having summoned Moreland with the
keys of the fortress, we marched into the house to search for
more of the gang.  Colonel Seabright with his sword drawn went
first, and then I, exactly the figure of Robinson Crusoe, with
a candle and lanthorn in my hand, a carbine upon my shoulder,
my hair wet and about my ears, and in a linen night-gown and
slippers.  We found the kitchen shutters forced but not
finished; and in the area a tremendous bag of tools, a hammer
large enough for the hand of a Joel, and six chisels! All which
opima spolia, as there was no temple of Jupiter Capitolinus in
the neighbourhood, I was reduced to offer on the altar of Sir
Thomas Clarges.

am now, as I told you, returned to my plough with as much
humility and pride as any of my great predecessors.  We lead
quite a rural life, have had a sheep-shearing, a hay-making, a
syllabub under the cow, and a fishing of three gold fish out of
Poyang,(313) for a present to Madam Clive.  They breed with me
excessively, and are grown to the size of small perch.  Every
thing grows, if tempests would let it; but I have had two of my
largest trees broke to-day with the wind, and another last
week.  I am much obliged to you for the flower you offer me,
but by the description it is an Austrian rose, and I have
several now in bloom.  Mr. Bentley is with me, finishing the
drawings for Gray's Odes; there are some mandarin-cats fishing
for gold fish, which will delight you; au reste, he is just
where he was: he has heard something about a journey to
Haughton, to the great Cu(314) of Hauculeo, but it don't seem
fixed, unless he hears farther.  Did he tell you the Prices and
your aunt Cosby had dined here from Hampton Court? The
mignonette beauty looks mighty well in his grandmother's
jointure.  The Memoires of last year are quite finished, but I
shall add some pages of notes, that will not want anecdotes.
Discontents, of the nature of those about Windsor-park, are
spreading about Richmond.  Lord Brooke, who has taken the late
Duchess of Rutland's at Petersham, asked for a key; the answer
was, (mind it, for it was tolerably mortifying to an Earl,) "that
the Princess had already refused one to my Lord Chancellor."

By the way, you know that reverend head of the law is
frequently shut up here with my Lady M * * * * h, who is as
rich and as tipsy as Cacafogo in the comedy.  What a jumble of
avarice, lewdness, dignity,--and claret!

You will be pleased with a story of Lord Bury, that is come
from Scotland: he is quartered at Inverness: the magistrates
invited him to an entertainment with fire-works, which they
intended to give on the morrow for the Duke's birthday.  He
thanked them, assured them he would represent their zeal to his
Royal Highness; but he did not doubt but it would be more
agreeable to him, if they postponed it to the day following,
the anniversary of the battle of Culloden.  They stared, said
they could not promise on their own authority, but would go and
consult their body.  They returned, told him it was
unprecedented, and could not be complied with.  Lord Bury
replied, he was sorry they had not given a negative at once,
for he had mentioned it to his soldiers, who would not bear a
disappointment, and was afraid it would provoke them to some
outrage upon the town.  This did;-they celebrated Culloden.
Adieu!

131 Letter 60
To George Montagu, Esq.
Twickenham, Thursday.

Dear George,
Since you give me leave to speak the truth, I must own it is
not quite agreeable to me to undertake the commission you give
me; nor do I say this to assume any merit in having obeyed you,
but to prepare you against my solicitation miscarrying, for I
cannot flatter myself with having so much interest with Mr. Fox
as you think.  However, I have wrote to him as pressingly as I
could, and wish most heartily it may have any effect.  Your
brother I imagine will call upon him again; and Mr.' Fox will
naturally tell him whether he can do it or not at my request.


I should have been very glad of your company, if it had been
convenient.  You would have found me an absolute country
gentleman: I am in the garden, planting as long as it is light,
and shall not have finished, to be in London, before the middle
of next week.

My compliments to your sisters and to the Colonel; and what so
poor a man as Hamlet is, may do to express his love and
friending to him, God willing, shall not lack.  Adieu!



132 Letter 61
The Hon. H. S. Conway.(315)
Strawberry Hill, June 23, 1752.

By a letter that I received from my Lady Ailesbury two days
ago, I flatter myself I shall not have occasion to write to you
any more; yet I shall certainly see you with less pleasure than
ever, as our meeting is to be attended with a resignation of my
little charge.(316)  She is vastly well, and I think you will
find her grown fat.  I am husband enough to mind her beauty no
longer, and perhaps you will say husband enough too, in
pretending that my love is converted into friendship; but I
shall tell you some stories at Park-place of her understanding
that will please you, I trust, as much as they have done me.

My Lady Ailesbury says I must send her news, and the whole
history of Mr. Seymour and Lady Di. Egerton, and their quarrel,
and all that is said on both sides.  I can easily tell her all
that is said on one side, Mr. Seymour's, who says, the only
answer he has ever been able to get from the Duchess or Mr.
Lyttelton was, that Di. has her caprices.  The reasons she
gives, and gave him, were, the badness of his temper and
imperiousness of his letters; that he scolded her for the
overfondness of her epistles, and was even so unsentimental as
to talk of desiring to make her happy, instead of being made so
by her.  He is gone abroad, in despair, and with an additional
circumstance, which would be very uncomfortable to any thing
but a true lover; his father refuses to resettle the estate on
him, the entail of which was cut off by mutual consent, to make
way for the settlements on the marriage.

The Speaker told me t'other day, that he had received a letter
from Lord Hyde, which confirms what Mr. Churchill writes me,
the distress and poverty of France and the greatness of their
divisions.  Yet the King's expenses are incredible; Madame de
Pompadour is continually busied in finding out new journeys and
diversions to keep him from falling into the hands of the
clergy.  The last party of pleasure she made for him, was a
stag-hunting; the stag was a man in a skin and horns, worried
by twelve men dressed like bloodhounds!  I have read of
Basilowitz, a Czar of Muscovy, who improved on such a hunt, and
had a man in a bearskin worried by real dogs; a more kingly
entertainment!

I shall make out a sad Journal of other news; yet I will be
like any gazette, and scrape together all the births, deaths,
and marriages in the parish.  Lady Hartington and Lady Rachel
Walpole are brought to bed of sons; Lord Burlington and Lord
Gower have had new attacks of palsies: Lord Falkland is to
marry the Southwark Lady Suffolk;(317) and Mr. Watson, Miss
Grace Pelham.  Lady Coventry has miscarried of one or two
children, and is going on with one or two more, and is gone to
France to-day.  Lady Townshend and Lady Caroline Petersham have
had their anniversary quarrel, and the Duchess of Devonshire has
had her secular assembly, which she keeps once in fifty years:
she was more delightfully vulgar at it than you can imagine;
complained of the wet night, and how the men would dirty the
rooms with their shoes; called out at supper to the Duke, "Good
God! my lord, don't cut the ham, nobody will eat any!" and
relating her private m`enage to Mr. Obnir, she said, "When
there's only my lord and I, besides a pudding we have always a
dish of Yeast!" I am ashamed to send you such nonsense, or to
tell you how the good women at Hampton Court are scandalized at
Princess Emily's coming to chapel last Sunday in riding-clothes
with a dog under her arm; but I am bid to send news: what can we
do -,it such a dead time of year? I must conclude, as my Lady
Gower did very well t'other day in a letter into the country,
"Since the two Misses(318) were hanged, and the two Misses(319)
were married, there is nothing at all talked of." Adieu! My best
compliments and my wife's to your two ladies.

133 Letter 62
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 20, 1752.

You have threatened me with a messenger from the secretary's
office to seize my papers; who would ever have taken you for a
prophet? If Goody Compton
,(320) your colleague, had taken upon her to foretell, there
was enough of the witch and prophetess in her person and
mysteriousness to have made a superstitious person believe she
might be a cousin of Nostradamus, and heiress of some of her
visions; but how came you by second sight? Which of the Cues
matched in the Highlands?  In short, not to keep you in
suspense, for I believe you are so far inspired as to be
ignorant how your prophecy was to be accomplished, as we were
sitting at dinner t'other day, word was brought that one of the
King's messengers was at the door.  Every drop of ink in my pen
ran cold; Algernon Sidney danced before my eyes, and methought
I heard my Lord Chief-Justice Lee, in a voice as dreadful as
Jefferies', mumble out, Scribere est agere.  How comfortable it
was to find that Mr. Amyand, who was at table, had ordered this
appanage of his dignity to attend him here for orders!
However, I have buried the Memoires under the oak in my garden,
where they are to be found a thousand years hence, and taken
perhaps for a Runic history in rhyme.  I have part of another
valuable MS. to dispose of, which I shall beg leave to commit
to your care, and desire it may be concealed behind the wainscot
in Mr. Bentley's Gothic house, whenever you build it.  As the
great person is living to whom it belonged, it would be highly
dangerous to make it public; as soon as she is in disgrace, I
don't know whether it Will not be a good way of making court to
her successor, to communicate it to the world, as I propose
doing, under the following title: "The Treasury of Art and
Nature, or a Collection of inestimable Receipts, stolen out of
the Cabinet of Madame de Pompadour, and now first published for
the use of his fair Countrywomen, by a true born Englishman and
philomystic."  * * * * * * * * * * * * *

So the pretty Miss Bishop,(321) instead of being my niece, is
to be Mrs. Bob Brudenel.  What foolish birds are turtles when
they have scarce a hole to roost in! Adieu!

134 Letter 63
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 27, 1752.

What will you say to me after a silence of two months? I should
be ashamed, if I were answerable for the whole world, who will
do nothing worth repeating.  Newspapers have horse-races, and
can invent casualties, but I can't have the confidence to stuff
a letter with either.  The only casualty that is of dignity
enough to send you, is a great fire at Lincoln's Inn, which is
likely to afford new work for the lawyers, in consequence of
the number of deeds and writings it has consumed.  The Duke of
Kingston has lost many of his: he is unlucky with fires:
Thoresby, his seat, was burnt a few years ago, and in it a
whole room of valuable letters and manuscripts.  There has been
a Very considerable loss of that kind at this fire: Mr. Yorke,
the Chancellor's son, had a great collection of Lord Somers's
papers, many relating to the assassination plot; and by which,
I am told, it appeared that the Duke of Marlborough was deep in
the schemes of St. Germain's.

There are great civil wars in the neighbourhood of Strawberry
Hill: Princess Emily, who succeeded my brother in the
rangership of Richmond Park, has imitated her brother William's
unpopularity, and disobliged the whole country, by refusal of
tickets and liberties, that had always been allowed.  They are
at law with her, and have printed in the Evening Post a strong
Memorial, which she had refused to receive-.(322)  The High
Sheriff of Surrey, to whom she had denied a ticket, but on
better thought had sent one, refused it, and said he had taken
his part.  Lord Brooke(323) who had applied for one, was told
he could not have one-and to add to the affront@, it was
signified. that the Princess had refused one to my Lord
Chancellor--your old nobility don't understand such comparisons!
But the most remarkable event happened to her about three weeks
ago.  One Mr. Bird, a rich gentleman near the park, was applied
to by the late Queen for a piece of ground that lay convenient
for a walk she was making: he replied, it was not proper for him
to pretend to make a Queen a present; but if she would do what
she pleased with the ground, he would be content with the
acknowledgment of a key and two bucks a-year.  This was
religiously observed till the era of her Royal Highness's
reign; the bucks were denied, and he himself once shut out, on
pretence it was fence-month (the breeding-time, when tickets
used to be excluded, keys never.)  The Princess soon after was
going through his grounds to town; she found a padlock on his
gate; she ordered it to be broke open: Mr. Shaw, her deputy,
begged a respite, till he could go for the key.  He found Mr.
Bird at home--"Lord, Sir! here is a strange mistake; the
Princess is at the gate, and it is padlocked!"  "Mistake! no
mistake at all - I made the road: the ground is my own
property: her Royal Highness has thought fit to break the
agreement which her Royal Mother made with me: nobody goes
through my grounds but those I choose should.  Translate this
to your Florentinese; try if you can make them conceive how
pleasant it is to treat blood royal thus!

There are dissensions of more consequence in the same
neighbourhood.  The tutorhood at Kew is split into factions:
the Bishop of Norwich and Lord Harcourt openly at war with
Stone and Scott, who are supported by Cresset, and countenanced
by the Princess and Murray--so my Lord Bolinbroke dead, will
govern, which he never could living! It is believed that the
Bishop will be banished into the rich bishopric of Durham,
which is just vacant-how pleasant to be punished, after
teaching the boys a year, with as much as he could have got if
he had taught them twenty! Will they ever expect a peaceable
prelate, if untractableness is thus punished?

Your painter Astley is arrived: I have missed seeing him by
being constantly at Strawberry Hill, but I intend to serve him
to the utmost of my power, as you will easily believe, since he
has your recommendation.


Our beauties are travelling Paris-ward: Lady Caroline Petersham
and Lady Coventry are just gone thither.  It will scarce be
possible for the latter to make as much noise there as she and
her sister have in England.  It is literally true that a
shoemaker it Worcester got two guineas and a half by showing a
shoo that he was making for the Countess, at a penny a piece.
I can't say her genius is equal to her beauty: she every day
says some new sproposito.  She has taken a turn of vast
fondness for her lord: Lord Downe met them at Calais, and
offered her a tent-bed, for fear of bugs in the inns.  "Oh!"
said she, "I had rather be bit to death, than lie one night
from my dear Cov.!"  I can conceive my Lady Caroline making a
good deal of noise even at Paris; her beauty is set off by a
genius for the extraordinary, and for strokes that will make a
figure in any country.  Mr. Churchill and my sister are just
arrived from France; you know my passion for the writing of the
younger Cr`ebillon:(324) you
shall hear how I have been mortified by the discovery of the
greatest meanness in him; and you will judge how much one must
be humbled to have one's favourite author convicted of mere
mercenariness! I had desired lady Mary to lay out thirty
guineas for ne with Liotard, and wished, if I could, to have
the portraits of Cr`ebillon and Marivaux(325) for my cabinet.
Mr. Churchill wrote me word that Liotard's(326) price was
sixteen guineas; that Marivaux was intimate with him, and would
certainly sit, and that he believed he could get Cr`ebillon to
sit too.  The latter, who is retired into the provinces with an
English wife,(327) was just then at Paris for a month: Mr.
Churchill went to him, told him that a gentleman in England,
who was making a collection of portraits of famous people,
would be happy to have his, etc.  Cr`ebillon was humble,
"unworthy," obliged; and sat: the picture was just finished,
when, behold! he sent Mr. Churchill word, that he expected to
have a copy of the picture given him-neither more nor less than
asking sixteen guineas for sitting!  Mr. Churchill answered
that he could not tell what he should do, were it his own case,
but that this was a limited commission, and he could not
possibly lay out double; and was now so near his return, that
he could not have time to write to England and receive an
answer.  Cr`ebillon said, then he would keep the picture
himself-it was excessively like.  I am still sentimental enough
to flatter myself, that a man who could beg sixteen gineas will
not give them, and so I may still have the picture.

I am going to trouble you with a commission, my dear Sir, that
will not subject me to any such humiliations.  You may have
heard that I am always piddling about ornaments and
improvements for Strawberry Hill-I am now doing a great deal to
the house--stay, I don't want Genoa damask!(328) What I shall
trouble you to buy is for the garden: there is a small recess,
for which I should be glad to have an antique Roman sepulchral
altar, of the kind of the pedestal to my eagle; but as it will
stand out of doors, I should not desire to have it a fine one: a
moderate one, I imagine, might be picked up easily at Rome at a
moderate price: if you could order any body to buy such an one, I
should be much obliged to you.

We have had an article in our papers that the Empress-queen had
desired the King of France to let her have Mesdames de Craon
and de la Calmette, ladies of great piety and birth, to form an
academy for the young Archduchesses-is there any truth in this?
is the Princess to triumph thus at last over Richcourt? I
should be glad.  What a comical genealogy in education! the
mistress and mother of twenty children to Duke Leopold, being
the pious tutoress to his grand-daughters! How the old Duchess
of Lorrain will shiver in her coffin at the thoughts of it? Who
is la Calmette?  Adieu! my dear child! You see my spirit of
justice: when I have not writ to you for two months, I punish
you with a reparation of six pages!--had not I better write one
line every fortnight?

(322) The memorial will be found in the Gentleman's Magazine
for this year.  In December the park was opened by the King's
order.-E.

(323) Francis Greville, Earl Brooke.


(324) Claude Prosper Jolyot de Cr`ebillon, son of the tragic
poet of that name, and author of many licentious novels, which
are now but little read.  He was born in 1707, and died in
1777.-D.  ["The taste for his writings," says the Edinburgh
Reviewers, " passed away very rapidly and completely in France;
and long before his death, the author of the Sopha, and Les
Egaremens du Coeur et de l'Esprit, had the mortification to be
utterly forgotten by the public." Vol. xxi. p. 284.]

(325) Pierre Carlet de Chamblain de Marivaux, the author of
numerous plays and novels, some of which possess considerable
merit.  The peculiar affectation of his style occasioned the
invention of the word marivaudage, to express the way of
writing of him and his imitators.  He was born in 1688, and
died in 1763.-D.

(326) Walpole, in his Anecdotes of Painting, states Liotard to
have been an admirable miniature and enamel painter.  At Rome
he was taken notice of by the Earl of Sandwich, and by Lord
Besborough, then Lord Duncannon.  See Museum Florentinum, vol.
x.; where the name of the last mentioned nobleman is spelled
Milord D'un Canon.-E.

(327) She was a Miss Strafford.  The perusal of Cr`ebillon's
works inspired her with such a passion for the author, that she
ran away from her friends, went to Paris, married him, and
nursed and attended him with exemplary tenderness and affection
to his dying day.  In reference to this marriage, Lord Byron,
in his Observations on Bowles's Strictures upon Pope, makes the
following remark:--"For my own part, I am of the opinion of
Pausanias, that success in love depends upon fortune.  Grimm
has an observation of the same kind, on the different destinies
of the younger Cr`ebillon and Rousseau.  The former writes a
licentious novel, and a young English girl of some fortune runs
away, and crosses the sea to marry him; while Rousseau, the
most tender and passionate of lovers, is obliged to espouse his
chambermaid."-E.

(328) Lord Cholmondoley borrowed great sums of money of various
people, under the pretence of a quantity of Genoa damask being
arrived for him, and that his banker was out of town, and he
must pay for it immediately.  Four persons comparing notes,
produced four letters from him in a coffeehouse, in the very
same words.



137 Letter 64
To Richard Bentley, Esq.(329)
Battel, Wednesday, August 5, 1752.

here we are, my dear Sir, in the middle of our pilgrimage; and
lest we should never return from this holy land of abbeys and
Gothic castles, I begin a letter to you. that I hope some
charitable monk, when he has buried our bones, will deliver to
you.  We have had piteous distresses, but then we have seen
glorious sights!  You shall hear of each in their order.

Monday, Wind S. E.--at least that was our direction--While they
were changing our horses at Bromley, we went to see the Bishop
of Rochester's palace; not for the sake of any thing there was
to be seen, but because there was a chimney, in which had stood
a flower-pot, in which was put the counterfeit plot against
Bishop Sprat.  'Tis a paltry parsonage, with nothing of
antiquity but two panes of glass, purloined from Islip's chapel
in Westminster Abbey, with that abbot's rebus, an eye and a
slip of a tree.  In the garden there is a clear little pond,
teeming with gold fish.  The Bishop is more prolific than I am.

>From Sevenoaks we went to Knowle.  The park is sweet, with much
old beech, and an immense sycamore before the great gate,
that makes me more in love than ever with sycamores.  The house
is not near so extensive as I expected:(330) the outward court
has a beautiful decent simplicity that charms one.  The
apartments are many, but not large.  The furniture throughout,
ancient magnificence; loads of portraits, not good nor curious;
ebony cabinets, embossed silver in vases, dishes, etc.
embroidered beds, stiff chairs, and sweet bags lying on velvet
tables, richly worked in silk and gold.  There are two
galleries, one very small; an old hall, and a spacious great
drawing-room.  There is never a good staircase.  The first
little room you enter has sundry portraits of the times; but
they seem to have been bespoke by the yard, and drawn all by
the same painter; One should be happy if they were authentic;
for among them there is Dudley, Duke of Northumberland,
Gardiner of Winchester, the Earl of Surry, the poet, when a
boy, and a Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, but I don't know which.
The only fine picture is of Lord Goring and Endymion Porter by
Vandyke.  There is a good head of the Queen of Bohemia, a
whole-length of Duc d'Espernon, and another good head of the
Clifford, Countess of Dorset, who wrote that admirable haughty
letter to Secretary Williamson, when he recommended a person to
her for member for Appleby: "I have been bullied by an usurper,
I have been neglected by a court, but I won't be dictated to by
a subject: your man shan't stand.  Ann Dorset, Pembroke and
Montgomery."  In the chapel is a piece of ancient tapestry:
Saint Luke in his first profession is holding an urinal.  Below
stairs is a chamber of poets and players, which is proper
enough in that house; for the first Earl wrote a play,(331) and
the last Earl was a poet,(332) and I think married a
player(333) Major Mohun and Betterton are curious among the
latter, Cartwright and Flatman among the former.  The arcade is
newly enclosed, painted in fresco, and with modern glass of all
the family matches.  In the gallery is a whole-length of the
unfortunate Earl of Surry, with his device, a broken column,
and the motto Sat superest.  My father had one of them, but
larger, and with more emblems, which the Duke of Norfolk bought
at my brother's sale.  There is one good head of henry VIII.,
and divers of Cranfield, Earl of Middlesex, the citizen who
came to be lord treasurer, and was very near coming to be
hanged.(334)  His Countess, a bouncing kind of lady-mayoress,
looks pure awkward amongst so much good company.  A visto cut
through the wood has a delightful effect from the front: but
there are some trumpery fragments of gardens that spoil the view
from the state apartments.

We lay that night at Tunbridge town, and were surprised with
the ruins of the old castle.  The gateway is perfect, and the
enclosure formed into a vineyard by a Mr. Hooker, to whom it
belongs, and the walls spread with fruit, and the mount on
which the keep stood, planted in the same way.  The prospect is
charming, and a breach in the wall opens below to a pretty
Gothic bridge of three arches over the Medway.  We honoured the
man for his taste-not but that we wished the committee at
Strawberry Hill were to sit upon it, and stick cypresses among
the hollows.--But, alas! he sometimes makes eighteen sour
hogsheads, and is going to disrobe 'the ivy-mantled tower,'
because it harbours birds!

Now begins our chapter of woes.  The inn was full of farmers
and tobacco; and the next morning, when we were bound for
Penshurst, the only man in the town who had two horses would
not let us have them, because the roads, as he said, were so
bad.  We were forced to send to the wells for others, which did
not arrive till half the day was spent-we all the while up to
the head and ears in a market of sheep and oxen.  A mile from
the town we climbed up a hill to see Summer Hill,(335) the
residence of Grammont's Princess of Babylon.(336)  There is now
scarce a road to it: the Paladins of those times were too
valorous to fear breaking their necks; and I much apprehend
that la Monsery and the fair Mademoiselle Hamilton,(337) must
have mounted their palfreys and rode behind their
gentlemen-ushers upon pillions to the Wells.  The house is
little better than a farm, but has been an excellent one, and
is entire, though out of repair.  I have drawn the front of it
to show you, which you are to draw over again to show me. It
stands high, commands a vast landscape beautifully wooded, and
has quantities of large old trees to shelter itself, some of
which might be well spared to open views.

>From Summer Hill we went to Lamberhurst to dine; near which,
that is, at the distance of three miles, up and down
impracticable hills, in a most retired vale, such as Pope
describes in the last Dunciad,

"Where slumber abbots, purple as their vines,"

We found the ruins of Bayham Abbey, which the Barrets and
Hardings bid us visit.  There are small but pretty remains, and
a neat little Gothic house built near them by their nephew
Pratt.  They have found a tomb of an abbot, with a crosier, at
length on the stone.

Here our woes increase.  The roads row bad beyond all badness,
the night dark beyond all darkness, our guide frightened beyond
all frightfulness.  However, without being at all killed, we
got UP, or down,--I forget which, it was so dark,--a famous
precipice called Silver Hill, and about ten at night arrived at
a wretched village called Rotherbridge.  We had still six miles
hither, but determined to stop, as it would be a pity to break
our necks before we had seen all we intended.  But alas! there
was only one bed to be had: all the rest were inhabited by
smugglers, whom the people of the house called mountebanks; and
with one of whom the lady of the den told Mr. Chute he might
lie.  We did not at all take to this society, but, armed with
links and ]anthems, set out again upon this impracticable
journey.  At two o'clock in the morning we got hither to a
still worse inn, and that crammed with excise officers, one of
whom had just shot a smuggler.  However, as we were neutral
powers, we have passed safely through both armies hitherto, and
can give you a little farther history of our wandering through
these mountains, where the young gentlemen are forced to drive
their curricles with a pair of oxen.  the only morsel of good
road we have found, was what even the natives had assured us
was totally impracticable: these were eight miles to Hurst
Monceaux.(338)  It is seated at the end of a large vale, five
miles in a direct line to the sea, with wings of blue hills
covered with wood, one of which falls down to the in a sweep of
a hundred acres.  The building, for the convenience of water to
the moat, sees nothing at all; indeed it is entirely imagined
on a plan of defence, with drawbridges actually in being, round
towers, watch-towers mounted on them, and battlements pierced
for the passage of arrows from long bows.  It was built in the
time of Henry VI., and is as perfect as the first day.  It does
not seem to have been ever quite finished, or at least that age
was not arrived at the luxury of white-wash; for almost all the
walls, except in the principal chambers, are in their native
brickhood.  It is a square building, each side about two
hundred feet in length; a porch and cloister, very like Eton
College; and the -whole is much in the same taste, the kitchen
extremely so, with three vast funnels to the chimneys going up
on the inside.  There are two or three little courts for
offices, but no magnificence of apartments.  It is scarcely
furnished with a few necessary beds and chairs: one side has
been sashed, and a drawing-room and dining-room and two or
three rooms wainscoted by the Earl of Sussex, who married a
natural daughter of Charles II.  Their arms with delightful
carvings by Gibbons-, particularly two pheasants, hang Over the
chimneys.  Over the great drawing-room chimney is the first
coat armour of the first Leonard, Lord Dacre, with all his
alliances.  Mr. Chute was transported, and called cousin with ten
thousand quarterings.(339)  The chapel is small, and mean: the
Virgin and seven long lean saints, ill done, remain in the
windows.  There have been four more, but seem to have been
removed for light; and we actually found St. Catherine, and
another gentlewoman with a church in her hand, exiled into the
buttery.  There remain two odd cavities, with very small wooden
screens on each side the altar, which seem to have been
confessionals.  The outside is a mixture of gray brick and stone,
that has a very venerable appearance.  The drawbridges are
romantic to a degree; and there is a dungeon, that gives one a
delightful idea of living in the days of soccage and under such
goodly tenures.  They showed us a dismal chamber which they
called Drummer's-hall, and suppose that Mr. Addison's comedy is
descended from it.  In the windows of the gallery over the
cloisters, which leads all round to the apartments, is the
device of the Fienneses, a wolf holding a baton with a scroll,
Le roy le veut--an unlucky motto, as I shall tell you
presently, to the last peer of that line.  The estate is two
thousand a year, and so compact as to have but seventeen houses
upon it.  We walked up a brave old avenue to the church, with
ships sailing on our left hand the whole way.  Before the altar
lies a lank brass knight, hight William Fienis, chevalier, who
obiit c.c.c.c.v. that is in 1405.  By the altar is a beautiful
tomb, all in our trefoil taste, varied into a thousand little
canopies and patterns, and two knights reposing on their backs.
These were Thomas, Lord Dacre, and his only son Gregory, who
died sans issue.  An old grayheaded beadsman of the family
talked to us of a blot in the scutcheon; and we had observed
that the field of the arms was green instead of blue, and the
lions ramping to the right, contrary to order.  This and the
man's imperfect narrative let us into the circumstances of the
personage before us; for there is no inscription.  He went in a
Chevy-chase style to hunt in a Mr. Pelham's(340) park at
Lawton: the keepers opposed, a fray ensued, a man was killed.
The haurhty baron took the death upon himself, as most secure
of pardon; but however, though there was no chancellor of the
exchequer in the question, he was condemned to be hanged: Le
roy le Vouloist.

Now you arc fully master of Hurst Monceaux, I shall carry you
on to Battel--By the way, we bring you a thousand sketches,
that you may show us what we have seen.  Battel Abbey stands at
the end of the town, exactly as Warwick Castle does of Warwick;
but the house of Webster have taken due care that it should not
resemble it in any thing else.  A vast building, which they
call the old refectory, but which I believe was the original
church, is now barn, coach-house, etc.  The situation is noble,
above the level of abbeys: what does remain of gateways and
towers is beautiful, particularly the flat side of a cloister,
which is now the front of the mansion-house. Miss of the family
has clothed a fragment of a portico with cockle-shells!  The
grounds, and what has been a park, lie in a vile condition.  In
the church is the tomb of Sir Anthony Browne, master of the horse
for life to Harry VIII.: from whose descendants the estate was
purchased.  The head of John Hanimond, the last abbot, is still
perfect in one of the windows.  Mr. Chute says, "What charming
things we should have done if Battel Abbey had been to be sold at
Mrs. Chenevix's, as Strawberry was!"  Good night!


Tunbridge, Friday.

We are returned hither, where we have established our
head-quarters.  On our way, we had an opportunity of surveying
that formidable mountain, Silver Hill, which we had floundered
down in the dark: it commands a whole horizon of the richest
blue prospect you ever saw.  I take it to be the ]Individual
spot to which the Duke of Newcastle carries the smugglers, and,
showing them Sussex and Kent, says, "All this will I give you,
if you will fall down and worship me." Indeed one of them, who
exceeded the tempter's warrant, hangs in chains on the very
spot where they finished the life of that wretched customhouse
officer whom they were two days in murdering.

This morning we have been to Penshurst-but, oh! how
fallen!(341)  The park seems to have never answered its
character: at present it is forlorn; and instead of
Sacharissa's(342) cipher carved on the beeches, I should sooner
have expected to have found the milkwoman's score.  Over the
gate is an inscription, purporting the manor to have been a
boon from Edward VI. to Sir William Sydney.  The apartments are
the grandest I have seen in any of these old palaces, but
furnished in tawdry modern taste.  There are loads of
portraits; but most of them seem christened by chance, like
children at a foundling hospital.  There is a portrait of
Languet,(343) the friend of Sir Philip Sydney; and divers of
himself and all his great kindred; particularly his
sister-in-law, with a vast lute, and Sacharissa, charmingly
handsome, But there are really four very great curiosities, I
believe as old portraits as any extant in England: they are,
Fitzallen, Archbishop of Canterbury, Humphry Stafford, the
first Duke of Buckingham; T. Wentworth, and John Foxle; all
four with the dates of their commissions as constables of
Queenborough Castle, from whence I suppose they were brought.
The last is actually receiving his investiture from Edward the
Third, and Wentworth is in the dress of Richard the Third's
time.  They are really not very ill done.(344)  There are six
more, only heads; and we have found since we came home that
Penshurst belonged for a time to that Duke of Buckingham.
There are some good tombs in the church, and a very Vandal one.
called Sir Stephen of Penchester.  When we had seen Penshurst,
we borrowed saddles, and, bestriding the horses of our
postchaise, set out for Hever,(345) to visit a tomb of Sir
Thomas Bullen, Earl of Wiltshire, partly with a view to talk of
it in Anna Bullen's walk at Strawberry Hill.  But the measure
of our woes was not full, we could not find our way.. and were
forced to return; and again lost ourselves in coming from
Penshurst, having been directed to what they call a better road
than the execrable one we had gone.

Since dinner we have been to Lord Westmorland's which is so
perfect in a Palladian taste, that I must own it has recovered
me a little from Gothic. It is better situated than I had
expected from the bad reputation it bears, and some prospect,
though it is in a moat, and mightily besprinkled with small
ponds.  The design, you know, is taken from the Villa del Capra
by Vicenza, but on a larger scale: yet, though it has cost an
hundred thousand pounds, it is still only a fine villa: the
finishing of in and outside has been exceedingly Expensive.  A
wood that runs up a hill behind the house is broke like an
Albano landscape, with an octagon temple and a triumphal arch;
But then there are some dismal clipt hedges, and a pyramid,
which by a most unnatural copulation is at once a grotto and a
greenhouse.  Does it not put you in mind of the proposal for
your drawing a garden-seat, Chinese on one side and Gothic on
the other? The chimneys, which are collected to a centre, spoil
the dome of the house, and the hall is a dark well.  The
gallery is eighty-two feet long, hung with green velvet and
pictures, among which is a fine Rembrandt and a pretty La Hire.
The ceilings are painted, and there is a fine bed of silk and
gold tapestry.  The attic is good, and the wings extremely
pretty, with porticoes formed on the style of the house.  The
Earl has built a new church, with a steeple which seems designed
for the latitude, of Cheapside, and is so tall that the poor
church curtsies under it, like Mary Rich(346) in a vast
high-crown hat: it has a round portico, like St. Clement's, with
vast Doric pillars supporting a thin shelf.  The inside is the
most abominable piece of tawdriness that ever was seen, stuffed
with pillars painted in imitation of verd antique, as all the
sides are like Sienna marble: but the greatest absurdity is a
Doric frieze, between the triglyphs of which is the Jehovah, the
I. H. S. and the Dove.  There is a little chapel with Nevil
tombs, particularly of the first Fane, Earl of Westmorland, and
of the founder of the old church, and the heart of a knight who
was killed in the wars.  On the Fane tomb is a pedigree of brass
in relief, and a genealogy of virtues to answer it.  There is an
entire window of painted-glass arms, chiefly modern, in the
chapel, and another over the high altar.  The hospitality of the
house was truly Gothic; for they made our postilion drunk, and he
overturned us close to a water and the bank did but just save us
from being in the middle of it.  Pray, whenever you travel in
Kentish roads, take care of keeping your driver sober.

Rochester, Sunday.

We have finished our progress sadly! Yesterday after twenty
mishaps we got to Sissinghurst to dinner.  There is a park in
ruins, and a house in ten times greater ruins, built by Sir
John Balier, chancellor of the exchequer to Queen Mary.  You go
through an arch of the stables to the house, the court of which
is perfect and very beautiful.  The Duke of Bedford has a house
at Cheneys, in Buckinghamshire, which seems to have been very
like it, but is more ruined.  This has a good apartment, and a
fine gallery, a hundred and twenty feet by eighteen, which
takes up one side: the wainscot is pretty and entire: the
ceiling vaulted, and painted in a light genteel grotesque.  The
whole is built for show: for the back of the house is nothing
but lath and plaster.  From thence we Went to Bocton-Malherbe,
where are remains of a house of the Wottons, and their tombs in
the church; but the roads were so exceedingly bad that it was
dark before we got thither, and still darker before we got to
Maidstone: from thence we passed this morning to Leeds
Castle.(347)  Never was such disappointment! There are small
remains: the moat is the only handsome object, and is quite a
lake, supplied by a cascade which tumbles through a bit of a
romantic grove.  The Fairfaxes have fitted up a pert, bad
apartment in the fore-part of the castle, and have left the only
tolerable rooms for offices.  They had a gleam of Gothic in their
eyes, but it soon passed off into some modern windows, and some
that never were ancient.  The only thing that at all recompensed
the fatigues we have undergone was the picture of the Duchess of
Buckingham,(348) la Ragotte, who is mentioned in Grammont--I say
us, for I trust that Mr. Chute is as true a bigot to Grammont as
I am.  Adieu? I hope you will be as weary
with reading our history as we have been in travelling it.
Yours ever.

and classical scholar.  He was educated at Trinity College,
under his father.  Cumberland, who was his nephew, describes
him as a man of various and considerable accomplishments;
possessing a fine genius, great wit, and a brilliant
imagination; "but there was," he adds, "a certain eccentricity
and want of prudence in his character, that involved him in
distresses, and reduced him to situations uncongenial with his
feelings, and unpropitious to the cultivation and encouragement
of his talents."-E.

(341) Evelyn, who visited Penshurst exactly a century before
Walpole, gives the Following brief notice of the place:-"July
9, 1652. We went to see Penshurst, the Earl of Leicester's,
famous once for its gardens and excellent fruit, and for the
noble conversation which Was wont to meet there, celebrated by
that illustrious person Sir Philip Sidney, who there composed
divers of his pieces.  It stands in a park, is finely watered,
and was now full of company, on the marriage of my old
fellow-collegiate, Mr. Robert Smith, who marries Lady Dorothy
Sidney, widow of the Earl of Sunderland."-E.

Leicester; of whom Waller was the unsuccessful suitor, and to
whom he addressed those elegant effusions of poetical
gallantry, in which she is celebrated under the name of
Sacharissa.  Walpole here alludes to the lines written at
Penshurst-

"Go, boy, and carve this passion on the bark
Of yonder tree, which stands the sacred mark
Of noble Sydney's birth; when such benign,
Such more than mortal-making stars did shine,
That there they cannot but for ever prove
The monument and pledge of humble love;
His humble love, whose hope shall ne'er rise higher,
Than for a pardon that he dares admire."-E.

Sir Thomas de Colepeper, who was castellan of the castle, was
hanged on the drawbridge for having refused admittance to
Isabel, the Queen-consort, in her progress in performing a
pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Thomas `a Becket at Canterbury.
The manor and castle were forfeited to the crown by his
attainder, but restored to his son, sir Thomas Colepeper.  By
his Diary of May 8, 1666, it appears to have been hired by

145 Letter 65
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Aug. 28, 1752.

Will you never have done jigging at Northampton with that old
harlotry Major Compton?  Peggy Trevor told me, she had sent you
a mandate to go thither.  Shall I tell you how I found Peggy,
that is, not Peggy, but her sister Muscovy?  I went, found a
bandage upon the knocker, an old woman and child in the hall,
and a black boy at the door.  Lord! thinks I, this can't be
Mrs. Boscawen's.  However, Pompey let me up; above were fires
blazing, and a good old gentlewoman, whose occupation easily
spoke itself to be midwifery. "Dear Madam, I fancy I should not
have come up."--"Las-a-day! Sir, no, I believe not; but I'll
stop and ask."  Immediately out came old Falmouth,(348) looking
like an ancient fairy, who had just been tittering a
malediction over a new-born prince, and told me, forsooth, that
Madame Muscovy was but just brought to bed, which Peggy Trevor
soon came and confirmed.  I told them I would write you my
adventure.  I have not thanked you for your travels, and the
violent curiosity you have given me to see Welbeck.  Mr. Chute
and I have been a progress too; but it was in a land you know
full well, the county of Kent.  I will only tell you that we
broke our necks twenty times to your health, and had a distant
glimpse of Hawkhurst from that Sierra Morena, Silver Hill.  I
have since been with Mr. Conway at Park-place, where I saw the
individual Mr. Cooper, a banker, and lord of the manor of
Henley, who had those two extraordinary forfeitures from the
executions of the Misses Blandy and Jefferies, two fields from
the former, and a malthouse from the latter.  I had scarce
credited the story, and was pleased to hear it confirmed by the
very person; though it was not quite so remarkable as it was
reported, for both forfeitures were in the same manor.

Mr. Conway has brought Lady Ailesbury from Minorca, but
originally from Africa, a Jeribo.  To be sure you know what
that is; if you don't, I will tell you, and then I believe you
will scarce know any better.  It is a composition of a
squirrel, a hare, a rat, and a monkey, which altogether looks
very like a bird.  In short, it is about the size of the first,
with much Such a head, except that the tip of the nose seems
shaved off, and the remains are like a human hare-lip; the ears
and its timidity are like a real hare.  It has two short little
feet before like a rat, but which it never uses for walking, I
believe never but to hold its food.  The tail is naked like a
monkey's, with a tuft of hair at the end; striped black and white
in rings.  The two hind legs are as long as a Granville's, with
feet more like a bird than any other animal, and upon these it
hops so immensely fast and upright that at a distance you would
take it for a large thrush.  It lies in cotton, is brisk at
night, eats wheat, and never drinks; it would, but drinking is
fatal to them.  Such is a Jeribo!

Have you heard the particulars of the Speaker's quarrel with a
young officer, who went to him, on his landlord refusing to
give his servant the second best bed in the inn?  He is a young
man of eighteen hundred a year, and passionately fond of the
army.  The Speaker produced the Mutiny-bill to him. "Oh Sir,"
said the lad, "but there is another act of parliament which
perhaps you don't know of." The "person of dignity," as the
newspapers call him, then was so ingenious as to harangue on
the dangers of a standing army.  The boy broke out, "Don't tell
me of your privileges: what would have become of you and your
privileges in the year forty-five, if it had not been for the
army--and pray, why do you fancy I would betray my country?  I
have as much to lose as you have!"  In short, this abominable
young hector treated the Speaker's oracular decisions with a
familiarity that quite shocks me to think of!

The Poemata-Grayo-Bentleiana, or Gray's Odes, better
illustrated than ever odes were by a Bentley, are in great
forwardness, and I trust will appear this Winter.  I shall tell
you One little anecdote about the authors and conclude.  Gray
is in love to distraction with a figure of Melancholy, which Mr
Bentley has drawn for one of the Odes, and told him he must
have something of his pencil: Mr. Bentley desired him to choose
a subject.  He chose Theodore and Honoria!--don't mention this,
for we are shocked.  It is loving melancholy till it is not
strong enough, and he grows to dram with Horror.  Good night!
my compliments to Miss Montagu; did you receive my recipes?

(348) Charlotte, daughter and co-heiress of Colonel Godfrey,
married in 1700 to Lord Falmouth.-E.



146 Letter 66
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 28, N. S. 1752.

I must certainly make you a visit, for I have nothing to say to
you.  Perhaps you will think this an odd reason; but as I
cannot let our intimacy drop, and no event happens here for
fuel to the correspondence, if we must be silent, it shall be
like a matrimonial silence, t`ete-`a-t`ete.  Don't look upon
this paragraph as a thing in the air, though I dare to say you
will, upon my repeating that I have any thoughts of a trip to
Florence: indeed I have never quite given up that intention and
if I can possibly settle my affairs at all to my mind, I
shall certainly execute my scheme towards the conclusion of
this Parliament, that is, about next spring twelvemonth: I
cannot bear elections: and still less, the hash of them over
again in a first session.  What vivacity such a reverberation
may give to the blood of England, I don't know; at present it
all stagnates.  I am sometimes almost tempted to go and amuse
myself at Paris with the bull Unigenius.  Our beauties are
returned, and have done no execution.  The French would not
conceive that Lady Caroline Petersham ever had been handsome,
nor that my Lady Coventry has much pretence to be so now.
Indeed all the travelled English allow that there is a Madame
de Broune handsomer, and a finer figure.  Poor Lady Coventry
was under piteous disadvantages; for besides being very silly,
ignorant of the world, breeding, speaking no French, and
suffered to wear neither red nor powder, she had that perpetual
drawback upon her beauty her lord, who is sillier in a wise
way, as ignorant, ill bred, and speaking very little French
himself-just enough to show how ill-bred he is.  The Duke de
Luxemburg told him he had called upon my Lady Coventry's coach;
my lord replied, "Vous avez fort bien fait."  He is jealous,
prude, and scrupulous; at a dinner at Sir John Bland's, before
sixteen persons, he coursed his wife round the table, on
suspecting she had stolen on a little red, seized her, scrubbed
it off by force with a napkin, and then told her, that since
she had deceived him and broke her promise, he would carry her
back directly to England.  They were pressed to stay for the
great fete at St. Cloud; he excused                   himself,
"because it would make him miss a music-meeting at Worcester;"
and she excused herself from the fireworks at Madame
Pompadour's, "because it was her dancing-master's hour."  I
will tell you but one more anecdote, and I think You cannot be
imperfect in your ideas of them.  The Mar`echale de lowendahl
was pleased with an English fan Lady Coventry had, who very
civilly gave it her: my lord made her write for it again next
morning, because he had given it her before marriage, and her
parting with it would make an irreparable breach," and send an
old one in the room of it!  She complains to every body she
meets, "How odd it is that my lord should use her so ill, when
she knows he has so great a regard that he would die for her,
and when he was so good as to marry her without a shilling!"
Her sister's history is not unentertaining: Duke Hamilton is
the abstract of Scotch pride: he and the Duchess at their own
house walk in to dinner before their company, sit together at
the upper end of their own table, eat off the same plate, and
drink to nobody beneath the rank of Earl-would not one wonder
how they could get any body either above or below that rank to
dine with them at all?  I don't know whether you will not think
all these very trifling histories; but for myself, I love any
thing that marks a character SO Strongly.

I told you how the younger Cr`ebillon had served me, and how
angry I am; yet I must tell you a very good reply of his.  His
father one day in a passion with him, said, "Il y a deux choses
que je voudrois n'avoir jamais fait, mon Catilina et vous!"  He
answered, "Consolez vous, mon p`ere, car on pr`etend que vous
n'avez fait ni l'un ni l'autre."  Don't think me infected with
France, if I tell you more French stories; but I know no
English ones, and we every day grow nearer to the state of a
French province, and talk from the capital.  The old
Cr`ebillon, who admires us as much as we do them. has long had
by him a tragedy called Oliver Cromwell, and had thoughts of
dedicating it to the Parliament of England: he little thinks
how distant a cousin the present Parliament is to the
Parliament he wots of.  The Duke of Richelieu's son,(349) who
certainly must not pretend to declare off, like Cr`ebillon's,
(he is a boy of ten years old,) was reproached for not minding
his Latin: he replied, "Eh! mon p`ere n'a jamais s`cu le Latin,
et il a eu les plus jolies femmes de France!" My sister was
exceedingly shocked with their indecorums: the night She
arrived at Paris, asking for the Lord knows what utensil, the
footman of the house came and "showed it her himself, and every
thing that is related to it.  Then, the footmen who brought
messages to her, came into her bedchamber in person; for they
don't deliver them to your servants, in the English way.  She
amused me with twenty other new fashions, which I should be
ashamed to set down, if a letter was at all upon a higher or
wiser foot than a newspaper.  Such is their having a knotting
bag made of the same stuff with every gown; their footmen
carrying their lady's own goblet whenever they dine; the King
carrying his own bread in his pocket to dinner, the etiquette
of the queen and the Mesdames not speaking to one another cross
him at table, and twenty other such nothings; but I find myself
Gossiping and will have done, with only two little anecdotes
that please me. Madame Pompadour's husband has not been
permitted to keep an opera-girl, because it would too
frequently occasion the reflection of his not having his wife--
is not that delightful decorum? and in that country! The other
was a most sensible trait of the King.  The Count
Charolois(350) shot a President's dogs, who lives near him: the
President immediately posted to Versailles to complain: the
King promised him justice; and then sent to the Count to desire
he would give him two good dogs.  The Prince picked out his two
best: the king sent them to the President, with this motto on
their collars, 'J'appartiens au Roi!'  "There," said the king,
"I believe he won't shoot them now!"

Since I began my letter, I looked over my dates, and was hurt
to find that three months are gone and over since I wrote last.
I was going to begin a new apology, when your letter of Oct.
20th came in, curtsying and making apologies itself.  I was
charmed to find you to blame, and had a mind to grow haughty
and scold you-but I won't.  My dear child, we will not drop one
another at last; for though we arc English, we are not both in
England, and need not quarrel we don't know why.  We will write
whenever we have any thing to say; and when we have not,--Why, we
will be going to write.  I had heard nothing of the Riccardi
deaths: I still like to hear news of any of my old friends.  Your
brother tells me that you defend my Lord Northumberland's idea
for his gallery, so I will not abuse it so much as I intended,
though I must say that I am so fired with copies of the pictures
he has chosen, that I would scarce hang up the originals--and
then, copies by any thing now living!--and at that price!--indeed
price is no article, or rather price is a reason for my Lord
Northumberland's liking any thing.  They are building at
Northumberland-house, at Sion, at Stansted, at Alnwick, and
Warkworth Castles!  they live by the etiquette of the old
peerage, have Swiss porters, the Countess has her pipers--in
short, they will very soon have no estate.

One hears here of writings that have appeared in print on the
quarrel of the Pretender and his second son; I could like to
see any such thing.  Here is a bold epigram, which the
Jacobites give about:

"In royal veins how blood resembling runs!
Like any George, James quarrels with his sons.
Faith! I believe, could he his crown resume,
He'd hanker for his herenhausen, Rome."

The second is a good line; but the thought in the last is too
obscurely expressed; and yet I don't believe that it was
designed for precaution.

I went yesterday with your brother to see Astley's(351)
pictures: mind, I confess myself a little prejudiced, for he
has drawn the whole Pigwigginhood.  but he has got too much
into the style of the four thousand English painters about
town, and is so intolerable as to work for money, not for fame:
in short, he is not such a Rubens as in your head--but I fear,
as I said, that I am prejudiced.  Did I ever tell you of a
picture at Woolterton of the whole family which I call the
progress of riches? there is Pigwiggin in a laced coat and
waistcoat; the second son has only the waistcoat trimmed; the
third is in a plain suit, and the little boy is naked.  I saw a
much more like picture of my uncle last night at Drury Lane in
the farce; there is a tailor who is exactly my uncle in person,
and my aunt in family.  Good night!  I wish you joy of being
dis-Richcourted; you need be in no apprehensions of his
Countess; she returns to England in the spring!  Adieu!

P.S. You shall see that I am honest, for though the beginning
of my letter is dated Oct. 28th, the conclusion ought to be
from Nov. 11th.

150 Letter 67
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(352)
Strawberry Hill, November 8th, 1752.

Dear Harry,
After divers mistakes and neglects of my own servants and Mr.
Fox's, the Chinese pair have at last set sail for Park-place: I
don't call them boar and sow, because of their being fit for
his altar: I believe, when you see them, you will think it is
Zicchi Micchi himself, the Chinese god of good eating and
drinking, and his wife.  They were to have been with you last
week, but the chairmen who were to drive them to the water side
got drunk, and said, that the creatures were so wild and
unruly, that they ran away and would not be managed.  Do but
think of their running! It puts me in mind of Mrs. Nugent's
talking of just jumping out of a coach!  I might with as much
propriety talk of' having all my clothes let out.  My coachman
is vastly struck with the goodly paunch of the boar, and says,
it would fetch three pounds in his country; but he does not
consider, that he is a boar with the true brown edge,(353) and
has been fed with the old original wheatsheaf: I hope you will
value him more highly: I dare say Mr. cutler or Margas,(354)
would at least ask twenty guineas for him, and swear that Mrs.
Dunch gave thirty for the fellow.

As you must of course write me a letter of thanks for my brawn,
I beg you will take that opportunity Of telling me very
particularly how my Lady Aylesbury does, and if she is quite
recovered, as I much hope? How does my sweet little wife do @
Are your dragons all finished? Have the Coopers seen Miss
Blandy's ghost, or have they made Mr. Cranston poison a dozen
or two more private gentlewomen? Do you plant without rain as I
do, in order to have your trees die, that you may have the
pleasure of planting them over again with rain? Have you any
Mrs. Clive(355) that pulls down barns that intercept your
prospect; or have you any Lord Radnor(356) that plants trees to
intercept his own prospect, that he may cut them down again to
make an alteration? There! there are as many questions as if I
were your schoolmaster or your godmother! Good night!

(352) Now first printed.

(353) He means such as are painted on old china with the brown
edge, and representations of wheatsheafs.-E.

(354) Fashionable china-shops.-E.

(355) Then living at Little Strawberry Hill.-E.

(356) The last Lord Radnor of the family of Robarts, then
living at Twickenham, very near Strawberry Hill.-E.



150 Letter 68
To George Montagu, Esq.
White's, December 3, 1752.

I shall be much obliged to you for the passion-flower,
notwithstanding it comes out of a garden of Eden, from which
Eve, my sister-in-law, long ago gathered passion-fruit.  I thank
you too for the offer of your Roman correspondences, but you know
I have done with virt`u, and deal only with the Goths and
Vandals.

You ask a very improper person, why my Lord Harcourt(357)
resigned.  My lord Coventry says it is the present great
arcanum of government, and you know I am quite out of the
circle of secrets.  The town says, that it was finding Stone is
a Jacobite; and it says, too, that the Whigs are very uneasy.
My Lord Egremont says the Whigs can't be in danger, for then my
Lord Hartington would not be gone a-hunting.  Every body is as
inpatient as you can be, to know the real cause, but I don't
find that either Lord or Bishop is disposed to let the world
into the true secret.  It is pretty certain that one Mr.
Cresset has abused both of them without ceremony, and that the
Solicitor-general told the Bishop in plain terms that my Lord
Harcourt was a cipher, and was put in to be a cipher: an
employment that, considering it is a sinecure, seems to hang
unusually long upon their hands.  They have so lately
quarrelled with poor Lord Holderness for playing at
blindman's-buff at Tunbridge, that it will be difficult to give
him another place only because he is fit to play at
blind-man's-buff; and yet it is much believed that he will be
the governor, and your cousin his successor.  I am as improper
to tell you why the governor of Nova Scotia is to be at the
head of the Independents.  I have long thought him one of the
greatest dependents, and I assure you I have seen nothing since
his return, to make me change my opinion.  He is too busy in
the bedchamber to remember me.

Mr. Fox said nothing about your brother; if the offer was
ill-designed from one quarter, I think you may make the refusal
of it have its weight in another.

It would be odd to conclude a letter from White's without a
bon-mot of George Selwyn's; he came in here t'other night, and
saw James Jefferies playing at piquet with Sir Everard
Falkener, "Oh!" says he, "now he is robbing the mail." Good
night! when do you come back?

(357) On the death of the Prince of Wales in 1751, his eldest
son, Prince George, was committed to the care of the Earl of
Harcourt as governor.




151 Letter 69
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Dec. 11, 1752, N. S.

I don't know whether I may not begin a new chapter of
revolutions: if one may trust prognosticators, the foundations
of a revolution in earnest are laying.  However, as I am only a
simple correspondent, and no almanack-maker, I shall be content
with telling you facts, and not conjectures, at least if I do
tell you conjectures they shall not be my own.  Did not I give
you a hint in the summer of some storms gathering in the
tutorhood?  They have broke out; indeed there wanted nothing to
the explosion but the King's arrival, for the instant he came, it
was pretty plain that he was prepared for the grievances he was
to hear--not very impartially it seems, for he would not speak to
Lord Harcourt.  In about three days he did, and saw him
afterwards alone in his closet.  What the conversation was, I
can't tell you: one should think not very explicit, for in a day
or two afterwards it was thought proper to send the Archbishop
and Chancellor to hear his lordship's complaints; but on
receiving a message that they would wait on him by the King's
orders, he prevented the visit by going directly to the
Chancellor; and on hearing their commission, Lord Harcourt, after
very civil speeches of regard to their persons, said, he must
desire to be excused, for what he had to say was of a nature that
made it improper to be said to any body but the King.  You may
easily imagine that this is interpreted to allude to a higher
person than the mean people who have offended Lord Harcourt and
the Bishop of Norwich.  Great pains were taken to detach the
former from the latter; "dear Harcourt, we love you, we wish to
make you easy; but the Bishop must go."  I don't tell you these
were the Duke of Newcastle's words; but if I did, would they be
unlike him?  Lord Harcourt fired, and replied with spirit,
"What! do you think to do me a favour by offering me to stay!
know, it is I that will not act with such fellows as Stone and
Cresset, and Scott: if they are kept, I will quit, and if the
Bishop is dismissed, I will quit too."  After a few days, he
had his audience and resigned.  It is said, that he frequently
repeated, "Stone is a Jacobite," and that the other person who
made up the t`ete-`a-t`ete cried, "Pray, my lord! pray, my
lord!"--and would not hear upon that subject.  The next day the
Archbishop went to the King, and begged to know whether the
Bishop of Norwich might have leave to bring his own
resignation, or whether his Majesty would receive it from him,
the Archbishop, The latter was chosen, and the Bishop' was
refused an audience.

You will now naturally ask me what the quarrel was: and that is
the most difficult point to tell you; for though the world
expects to see some narrative, nothing has yet appeared, nor I
believe will, though both sides have threatened.  The Princess
says, the Bishop taught the boys nothing; he says, he never was
suffered to teach them any thing.  The first occasion of
uneasiness was the Bishop's finding the Prince of Wales reading
the Revolutions of England, written by P`ere d'Orl`eans to
vindicate James II. and approved by that Prince.  Stone at
first peremptorily denied that he had seen that book these
thirty years, and offered to rest his whole justification upon
the truth or falsehood of this story.  However, it is now
confessed that the Prince was reading that book, but it is
qualified with Prince Edward's borrowing it of Lady Augusta.
Scott, the under-preceptor, put in by Lord Bolingbroke, and of no
very orthodox odour, was another complaint.  Cresset, the link of
the connexion, has dealt in no very civil epithets, for besides
calling Lord Harcourt a groom, he qualified the Bishop with
bastard and atheist,' particularly to one of the Princess's
chaplains, who, begged to be excused from hearing such language
against a prelate of the church, and not prevailing, has drawn
up a narrative, sent it to the Bishop, and offered to swear to
it.  For Lord Harcourt, besides being treated with considerable
contempt by the Princess, he is not uninformed of the light in
which he was intended to stand, by an amazing piece of
imprudence of the last, but not the most inconsiderable
performer in this drama, the Solicitor-general, Murray--pray,
what part has his brother, Lord Dunbar, acted in the late
squabbles in the Pretender's family? Murray, early in the
quarrel, went officiously to the Bishop, and told him Mr. Stone
ought to have more consideration in the family: the Bishop was
surprised, and got rid of the topic as well as he could.  The
visit and opinion were repeated: the Bishop said, he believed
Mr. Stone had all the regard shown him that was due; that lord
Harcourt, who was the chief person, was generally present.
Murray interrupted him, "Pho! Lord Harcourt!  he is a cipher,
and must be a cipher, and was put in to be a cipher."  Do you
think after this declaration, that the employment will be very
agreeable?  Every body but Lord Harcourt understood it before;
but at least the cipher  -ism was not notified in form.  Lord
Lincoln, the intimate friend of that lord, was so friendly to
turn his back upon him as he came out of the closet--and yet Lord
Harcourt and the Bishop have not at all lessened their characters
by any part of their behaviour in this transaction.  What will
astonish you, is the universal aversion that has broke out
against Stone: and what heightens the disgusts, is, the intention
there has been of making Dr. Johnson, the new Bishop of
Gloucester, preceptor.  He was master of Westminster School, of
Stone's and Murray's year, and is certainly of their
principles--to be sure, that is, Whig--but the Whigs don't seem
to think so.  As yet no successors are named; the Duke of
Leeds,(359) Lord Cardigan, Lord Waldegrave, Lord Hertford, Lord
Bathurst, and Lord Ashburnham,(360) are talked of for governor.
The two first are said to have refused; the third dreads it; the
next I hope will not have it; the Princess is inclined to the
fifth, and the last I believe eagerly wishes for it.  Within this
day or two another is named, which leads me to tell you another
interlude in our politics.  This is poor Lord Holderness --to
make room in the secretary's office for Lord Halifax.  Holderness
has been in disgrace from the first minute of the King's return:
besides not being spoken to, he is made to wait at the
closet-door with the bag in his hand, while the Duke of Newcastle
is within; though the constant etiquette has been for both
secretaries of state to go in together, or to go in immediately,
if one came after the other.  I knew of this disgrace; but not
being quite so able a politician as Lord Lincoln, at least having
an inclination to great men in misfortune, I went the other
morning to visit the afflicted.  I found him alone: he said, "You
are very good to visit any body in my situation." This lamentable
tone had like to have made me laugh; however I kept my
countenance, and asked him what he meant? he said, "Have not you
heard how the world abuses me only for playing at blindman's-buff
in a private room at Tunbridge?"  Oh! this was too much! I
laughed out.  I do assure you, this account of his misfortunes
was not given particularly to me: nay, to some he goes so far as
to say, "Let them go to the office, and look over my letters and
see if I am behindhand!"  To be sure, when he has done his book,
it is very hard he may not play! My dear Sir, I don't know what
apologies a P`ere d'Orl`eans must make for our present history!
it is too ridiculous!

The preceptor is as much in suspense as the governor.  The
Whigs clamour so much against Johnson, that they are regarded,-
-at least for a time.  Keene,(361) Bishop of Chester, and
brother of your brother minister, has been talked of.  He is a
man that will not prejudice his fortune by any ill-placed
scruples.  My father gave him a living of seven hundred pounds
a year to marry one of his natural daughters; he took the
living; and my father dying soon after, he dispensed with
himself from taking the wife, but was so generous as to give
her very near one year's income of the living.  He then was the
Duke of Newcastle's- tool at Cambridge, which university be has
half turned Jacobite, by cramming down new ordinances to carry
measures of that Duke; and being rewarded with the bishopric,
he was at dinner at the Bishop of Lincoln's when he received
the nomination.  He immediately rose from the table, took his
host into another room, and begged he would propose him to a
certain great fortune, to whom he never spoke, but for whom he
now thought himself a proper match.(362)  Don't you think he
would make a very proper preceptor?  Among other candidates,
they talk of Dr. hales, the old philosopher, a poor good
primitive creature, whom I call the Santon Barsisa; do you
remember the hermit in the Persian tales, who after living in
the odour of sanctity for above ninety years, was tempted to be
naughty with the King's daughter, who had been sent to his cell
for a cure?  Santon Hales but two years ago accepted the post of
clerk of the closet to the Princess, after literally leading the
life of a studious anchorite till past seventy.  If he does
accept the preceptorship, I don't doubt but by the time the
present clamours are appeased, the wick of his old life will be
snuffed out, and they will put Johnson in his socket.  Good
night! I shall carry this letter to town to-morrow, and perhaps
keep it back a few days, till I am able to send you this history
complete.

Arlington Street, Dec. 17th.

Well! at last we shall have a governor: after meeting with
divers refusals, they have forced lord Waldegrave(364) to take
it; and he kisses hands to-morrow. He has all the time declared
that nothing but the King's earnest desire should make him
accept it-and so they made the King earnestly desire it!  Dr.
Thomas, the Bishop of Peterborough, I believe, is to be the
tutor--I know nothing of him: he had lain by for many years,
after having read prayers to the present King when he lived at
Leicester House, which his Majesty remembered, and two years
ago popped him into a bishopric.

There is an odd sort of manifesto arrived from Prussia, which
does not make us in better humour at St. James's.  It stops the
payment of the interest on the Silesian loan, till satisfaction
is made some Prussian captures during the war.  The omnipotence
of the present ministry does not reach to Berlin! Adieu! All
the world are gone to their several Christmases, as I should
do, if I could have got my workmen out of Strawberry Hill; but
they don't work at all by the scale of my impatience.

(358) The Bishop of Norwich, who was a prelate of profound
learning, and conscientiously zealous for the mental
improvement of his pupil, disgusted the young Prince by his dry
and pedantic manners, and offended the Princess, his mother, by
persevering in the discipline which he deemed necessary to
remedy the gross neglect of her son's education." Coxe's
Pelham, vol. ii. p. 236.-E.

(359) Thomas Osborne, fourth Duke of Leeds.  He died in
1789.-D.

(360) John, second Earl of Ashburnham.  He died at a great age,
April 8th, 1812.-D.

(361) Dr. Edmund Keene, Bishop of Chester, was, for some reason
which is not known, the constant subject of Gray's witty and
splenetic effusions.  One of the chief amusements discovered by
the poet, pour passer le temps in a postchaise, was making
extempore epigrams upon the Bishop, and then laughing at them
immoderately.  The following, which is the commencement of one
of them, may serve as a specimen:

"Here lies Edmund Keene, the Bishop of Chester,
Who ate a fat goose and could not digest her."

(362) In the May of this year, Dr. Keene married the only
daughter of Lancelot Andrews, Esq. of Edmonton, formerly an
eminent linendraper in Cheapside, a lady of considerable
fortune.-E.

(363) Dr. Stephen Hales, author of "Vegetable Statics," and
"Vegetable Essays." This eminent natural philosopher and
vegetable physiologist was offered a canonry of Windsor, but
contented himself with the living of Teddington, which he held
with that of Farringdon.  He died in 1761, at the age of
eighty-four.

(364) Walpole, in his Memoires, gives the following account of
Lord Waldegrave's appointment: " The Earl accepted it at the
earnest request of the King, and after repeated assurances of
the submission and tractability of Stone.  The Earl was averse
to it.  He was a man of pleasure, understood the court, was
firm in the King's favour, easy in his circumstances, and at
once undesirous of rising, and afraid to fall.  He said to a
friend, "If I dared, I would make this excuse to the King-
-'Sir, I am too young to govern. and too old to be governed:'
but he was forced to submit.  A man of stricter honour and of
more reasonable sense could not have been selected for the
employment." Vol. i. p. 255.-E.



155 Letter 70
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 14, 1753.

I have been going to write to you every post for these three
weeks, and could not bring myself to begin a letter with "I
have nothing to tell YOU." But it grows past a joke; we will
not drop our correspondence because there is no war, no
Politics, no parties, no madness, and no scandal.  In the
memory of England there never was so inanimate an age: it is
more fashionable to go to church than to either House of
Parliament.  Even the era of the Gunnings is over: both sisters
have lain in, and have scarce made one paragraph in the
newspapers, though their names were grown so renowned, that in
Ireland the beggarwomen bless you with,-,, "the luck of the
Gunnings attend you!"

You will scarce guess how I employ my time; chiefly at present
in the guardianship of embryos and cockleshells.  Sir hans
Sloane is dead, and has made me one of the trustees to his
museum, which is to be offered for twenty thousand pounds to
the king, the Parliament, the Royal Academies of Petersburnh,
Berlin, Paris, and Madrid.(365)  He valued it at fourscore
thousand; and so would any body who loves hippopotamuses,
sharks with one ear, and spiders as big as geese! It is a
rent-charge, to keep the foetuses in spirits!  You may believe
that those who think money the most valuable of all
curiosities, will not be purchasers.  The King has excused
himself, saying he did not believe that there were twenty
thousand pounds in the treasury.  We are a charming, wise set,
all philosophers, botanists, antiquarians, and mathematicians;
and adjourned our first meeting because Lord Macclesfield, our
chairman, was engaged to a party for finding out the longitude.
One of our number is a Moravian who signs himself Henry XXVIII,
Count de Reus.  The Moravians have settled a colony at Chelsea,
in Sir Hans's neighbourhood, and I believe he intended to beg
Count Henry XXVIIIth's skeleton for his museum.

I am almost ashamed to be thanking you but now for a most
entertaining letter of two sheets, dated December 22, but I
seriously had nothing to form an answer.  It is but three
mornings ago that your brother was at breakfast with me, and
scolded me, "Why, you tell me nothing!"--"No," says I "if I had
any thing to say, I should write to your brother."  I give you
my word, that the first new book that takes, the first murder,
the first revolution, you shall have, with all the
circumstances.  In the mean time, do be assured that there
never was so dull a place as London, or so insipid an
inhabitant of it, as, yours, etc.

(365) Ames, in a letter written on the 22d of March to Mr. T.
Martin, says, "I cannot forbear to give you some relation of
Sir Hans Sloane's curiosities.  The Parliament has been pleased
to accept them on the condition of Sir Hans's codicil; that is,
that they should be kept together in one place in or near
London, and should be exhibited freely for a public use.  The
King, or they, by the will, were to have the first error.  The
19th instant being appointed for a committee of the whole
House, after several speeches, the Speaker himself moved the
whole House into a general regard to have them joined with the
King's and Cotton Libraries, together with those of one Major
Edwards, who had left seven thousand pounds to build a library,
besides his own books; and to purchase the Harleian
manuscripts, build a house for their reception," etc.  An act
was shortly after passed, empowering the Crown to raise a
sufficient sum by lottery to purchase the Sloane collection and
Harleian manuscripts, together with Montagu House.  Such was
the commencement of the British Museum.-E.



157 Letter 71
To Mr. Gray.
Arlington Street, Feb. 20, 1753.

I am very sorry that the haste I made to deliver you from your
uneasiness the first moment after I received your letter,
should have made me express myself in a manner to have the
quite contrary effect from what I intended.  You well know how
rapidly and carelessly I always write my letters: the note you
mention was written in a still greater hurry than ordinary, and
merely to put you out of pain.  I had not seen Dodsley,
consequently could only tell you that I did not doubt but he
would have no objection to satisfy you, as you was willing to
prevent his being a loser by the plate.(366)  Now, from this
declaration, how is it possible for you to have for one momentput
such a construction upon my words, as would have been a
downright stupid brutality, unprovoked?  It is impossible for
me to recollect my very expression, but I am confident that I
have repeated the whole substance.

How the bookseller would be less a loser by being at more
expense, I can easily explain to you.  He feared the price of
half a guinea would seem too high to most purchasers.  If by
the expense of ten guineas more he could make the book appear
so much more rich and showy as to induce people to think it
cheap, the profits from selling many more copies would amply
recompense him for his additional disbursement.

The thought of having the head engraved was entirely Dodsley's
own, and against my opinion, as I concluded it would be against
yours; which made me determine to acquaint you with it before
its appearance.

When you reflect on what I have said now, you will see very
clearly, that I had and could have no other possible meaning in
what I wrote last.  You might justly have accused me of
neglect, if I had deferred giving you all the satisfaction in
my powers, as soon as ever I knew your uneasiness.

The head I give up.(367)  The title I think will be wrong, and
not answer your purpose; for, as the drawings are evidently
calculated for the poems, how will the improper disposition of
the word designs before poems make the edition less yours? I am
as little convinced that there is any affectation in leaving out
the Mr. before your names: it is a barbarous addition: the other
is simple and classic; a rank I cannot help thinking due to both
the poet and painter.  Without ranging myself among classics, I
assure you, were I to print any thing with my name, it should
be plain Horace Walpole: Mr. is one of the Gothicisms I
abominate.  The explanation(368) was certainly added for people
who have not eyes:--such are-almost all who have seen Mr.
Bentley's drawings, and think to compliment him by mistaking
them for prints.  Alas! the generality want as much to have the
words "a man," "a cock," written under his drawings, as under
the most execrable hieroglyphics of Egypt, or of signpost
painters.

I will say no more now, but that you must not wonder if I am
partial to you and yours, when you can write as you do and yet
feel so little vanity.  I have used freedom enough with your
writings to convince you I speak truth: I praise and scold Mr.
Bentley immoderately, as I think he draws well or ill: I never
think it worth my while to do either, especially to blame,
where there are not generally vast excellencies.  Good night!
Don't suspect me when I have no fault but impatience to make
you easy.

(366) This was a print of Mr. Gray, after the portrait of him
by Eckardt.  It was intended to have been prefixed to Dodsley's
quarto edition of the Odes with Mr. Bentley's designs but Mr.
Gray's extreme repugnance to the proposal obliged his friends
to drop it.

(367) In a letter to Walpole, written from Stoke, in January,
on receiving a proof of the head, Gray had said, "Sure you are
not out of your wits! This I know, if you suffer my head to be
printed, you will put me out of mine.  I conjure you
immediately to put a stop to any such design.  Who is at the
expense of engraving it, I know not; but if it be Dodsley, I
will make up the loss to him.  The thing as it was, I know,
will make me ridiculous enough: but to appear in proper person,
at the head of my works, consisting Of half a dozen ballads in
thirty pages, would be worse than the pillory.  I do assure
you, if I had received such a book, with such a frontispiece,
without any warning, I do believe it would have given me the
palsy." Works, vol. iii. p. 106.-E.

(368) Of Mr. Bentley's designs.



158 Letter 72
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, March 4, 1753.

have you got any wind of our new histories? Is there any
account at Rome that Mr. Stone and the Solicitor-general are
still thought to be more attached to Egypt than Hanover?  For
above this fortnight there have been strange mysteries and
reports! the cabinet council sat night after night till two
o'clock in the morning: we began to think that they were
empannelled to sit upon a new rebellion, or invasion at least;
or that the King of Prussia, had sent his mandate, that we must
receive the young Pretender in part payment of the Silesian
loan.  At last it is come out that Lord Ravensworth,(369) on
the information of one Fawcett, a lawyer, has accused Stone,
Murray, and Dr. Johnson, the new Bishop of Gloucester, of
having had an odd custom of toasting the Chevalier and my Lord
Dunbar at one Vernon's, a merchant, about twenty years ago.
The Pretender's counterpart ordered the council to examine into
it: Lord Ravensworth stuck to his story: Fawcett was terrified
with the solemnity of the divan, and told his very different
Ways, and at last would not sign his deposition.  On the other
hand, Stone and Murray took their Bible on their innocence, and
the latter made a fine speech into the bargain.  Bishop Johnson
scrambled out of the scrape at the very beginning; and the
council have reported to the King that the accusation was false
and malicious.(370)  This is an exact abridgement of the story;
the commentary would be too voluminous.  The heats upon it are
great: the violent Whigs are not at all convinced of the Whiggism
of the culprits, by the defect of evidence: the opposite clan
affect as much conviction as if they wished them Whigs.

Mr. Chute and I are come hither for a day or two to inspect the
progress of a Gothic staircase, which is so pretty and so
small, that I am inclined to wrap it up and send it you in my
letter.  As my castle is so diminutive, I give myself a
Burlington air, and say, that as Chiswick is a model of Grecian
architecture, Strawberry Hill is to be so of Gothic.  I went
the other morning with Mr. Conway to buy some of the new
furniture-paper for you: if there was any money at Florence, I
should expect this manufacture would make its fortune there.

Liotard, the painter, is arrived, and has brought me Marivaux's
picture, which gives one a very different idea from what one
conceives of the author of Marianne, though it is reckoned
extremely like: the countenance is a mixture of buffoon and
villain.  I told you what mishap I had with Cr`ebillon's
portrait: he has had the foolish dirtiness to keep it.  Liotard
is a G`en`evois; but from having lived at Constantinopole, he
wears a Turkish habit, and a beard down to his girdle: this,
and his extravagant prices, which he has raised even beyond
what he asked at Paris, will probably get him as much money as
he covets, for he is avaricious beyond imagination.  His
crayons and his water-colours are very fine; his enamel, hard:
in general, he is too Dutch, and admires nothing but excess of
finishing.

We have nothing new but two or three new plays, and those not
worth sending to you.  The answer to the Prussian memorial,
drawn chiefly by Murray, is short, full, very fine, and has
more spirit than I thought we had by us.  The whole is rather
too good, as I believe our best policy would have been, to be
in the wrong, and make satisfaction for having been ill-used:
the author with whom we have to deal, is not a sort of man to
stop at being confuted.  Adieu!

(369) Sir Henry Liddel, Baron of Ravensworth.

(370) "Upon the whole matter," says the Hon.  Philip Yorke, in
his MS.  Parliamentary Journal, "the lords came unanimously to
an opinion of reporting to the King, that there appeared to
them no foundation for any part of the charge; that Mr.
Fawcett, the only evidence, had grossly prevaricated in it:
that it was malicious and scandalous, and ought not to affect
the character of the Bishop, or either of the gentlemen who
were aspersed by it."-E.



159 Letter 73
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 27, 1753.

Such an event as I mentioned to you in my last, has, you may
well believe, had some consequences; but only enough to show
what it would have had in less quiet times.  Last week the Duke
of Bedford moved in the House of Commons to have all the papers
relating to Lord Ravensworth and Fawcett laid before them.  As
he had given notice of his intention, the ministry, in a great
fright, had taken all kind of precaution to defeat the motion;
and succeeded--if it can be called success to have quashed the
demand, and thereby confirmed the suspicions.  After several
councils, it was determined, that all the cabinet councillors
should severally declare the insufficience and prevarication of
Fawcett's evidence: they did, and the motion Was rejected by
122 to 5.(371) If one was prejudiced by classic notions of the
wisdom and integrity of a senate, that debate would have cured
them.  The flattery to Stone was beyond belief: I will give you
but one instance.  The Duke of Argyll said, "He had happened to
be at the secretary's office during the rebellion, when two
Scotchmen came to ask for a place, which one obtained, the
other lost, but went away best pleased, from Mr. Stone's
gracious manner of refusal!"  It appeared in the most glaring
manner, that the Bishop of Gloucester had dictated to Fawcett a
letter of acquittal to himself; and not content with that, had
endeavoured to persuade him to make additions to it some days
after.  It was as plain, that Fawcett had never prevaricated
till these private interviews(372) With the prelate-yet there
were 122 to 5!

I take for granted our politics adjourn here till next winter
unless there should be any Prussian episode.  It is difficult
to believe that that King has gone so far, without intending to
go farther: if he is satisfied with the answer to his memorial,
though it is the fullest that ever was made, yet it will be the
first time that ever a monarch was convinced! For a King of the
Romans, it seems as likely that we should see a King of the
Jews.

Your brother has got the paper for your room.  He shall send
you with it a fine book which I have had printed of' Gray's
poems, with drawings by another friend of mine, which I am sure
will charm you, though none of them are quite well engraved,
and some sadly.  Adieu!  I am all brick and mortar: the castle
at Strawberry Hill grows so near a termination, that you must not
be angry if I wish to have you see it.  Mr. Bentley is going to
make a drawing of the best view, which I propose to have
engraved, and then you shall at least have some idea of that
sweet little spot--little enough, but very sweet!

(371) "The debate was long and heavy; the Duke of Bedford's
performance moderate enough: he divided the House, but it was
not told, for there went below the bar with him the Earl of
Harcourt, Lord Townshend, the Bishop of Worcester, and Lord
Talbot only.  Upon the whole, it was the worst judged, the
worst executed, and the worst supported point, that I ever saw
of so much expectations" Dodington, p. 202.-E.

(372) This insignificant, and indeed ridiculous accusation,
against Murray and Stone, is magnified by Walpole, both here
and in his Memoire,,,, into an important transaction, in
consequence of the hatred he bore to the persons accused,-D.
["The accusation was justly ridiculed by the wits of the day,
as a counterpart to the mountain in labour; and the Pelhams had
the satisfaction of seeing it terminate in the full exculpation
of their friends, the Solicitor-general and Mr. Stone." Coxe's
Pelham, vol. ii, p. 263.]

(373) On receiving a proof of the tail-piece, which Mr. Bentley
had designed for the Elegy in a Country Churchyard, and which
represents a village funeral, Gray wrote to Walpole: "I am
surprised at the print, which far surpasses my idea of London
graving: the drawing itself was so finished, that I suppose it
did not require all the art I imagined to copy it tolerably.
My aunts seeing me open your letter, took it to be a burying-
ticket, and asked whether any body had left me a ring; and so
they still conceive it to be, even with all their spectacles
on.  Heaven forbid they should suspect it to belong to any
verses of mine! They would burn me for a poet." Works, vol.
iii. p. 105.-E.



161 Letter 74
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 16, 1753.

Dear Sir,
I know I never give you more pleasure than in recommending such
an acquaintance as Mr. Stephens, a young gentleman now in
Italy, of whom I have heard from the best hands the greatest
and most amiable character.  He is brother-in-law of Mr.
West,(374) Mr. Pelham's secretary, and (to you I may add,) as I
know it will be an additional motive to increase your
attentions to his relation, a particular friend of mine.  I beg
you will do for my sake, what you always do from your own
goodness of heart, make Florence as agreeable to him as
possible: I have the strongest reasons to believe that you will
want no incitement the moment you begin to know Mr. Stephens.

(374) James West, member for St. Albans, secretary to Mr.
Pelham as chancellor of the exchequer, secretary to the
treasury, treasurer to the Royal Society, and member of the
Antiquarian Society, married the sister of this Mr. Stephens.



161 Letter 75
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, April 27, 1753.

I have brought two of your letters hither to answer: in town
there are so many idle people besides oneself, that one has not
a minute's time; here I have whole evenings, after the labours
of the day are ceased.  Labours they are, I assure you; I have
carpenters to direct, plasterers to hurry, papermen to scold,
and glaziers to help: this last is my greatest pleasure: I have
amassed such quantities of painted glass, that every window in
my castle will be illuminated with it: the adjusting and
disposing it is vast amusement.  I thank you a thousand times
for thinking of procuring me some Gothic remains from Rome; but
I believe there is no such thing there: I scarce remember any
morsel in the true taste of it in Italy. indeed, my dear Sir,
kind as you are about it, I perceive you have no idea what
Gothic is; you have lived too long amidst true taste, to
understand venerable barbarism.  You say, "You suppose my
garden is to be Gothic too."  That can't be; Gothic is merely
architecture; and as one has a satisfaction in imprinting the
gloom of abbeys and cathedrals on one's house, so one's garden,
on the contrary, is to be nothing but riot, and the gaiety of
nature.  I am greatly impatient for my altar, and so far from
mistrusting its goodness, I only fear it will be too good to
expose to the weather, as I intend it must be, in a recess in the
garden.  I was going to tell you that my house is so monastic,
that I have a little hall decked with long saints in lean arched
windows, and with taper columns, which we call the Paraclete, in
memory of Eloisa's cloister.(375)

I am glad you have got rid of your duel, bloodguiltless:
Captain Lee had ill luck in lighting upon a Lorrain officer; he
might have boxed the ears of the whole Florentine nobility,
(con rispetto si dice,) and not have occasioned you half the
trouble you have had in accommodating this quarrel.

You need not distrust Mr. Conway and me for showing any
attentions to Prince San Severino,(376) that may convince him
of' our regard for you; I only hope he will not arrive till
towards winter, for Mr. Conway is gone to his regiment in
Ireland, and my chateau is so far from finished, that I am by
no means in a condition to harbour a princely ambassador.  By
next spring I hope to have rusty armour, and arms with
quarterings enough to persuade him that I am qualified to be
Grand Master of Malta.  If you could send me Viviani,(377 with
his invisible architects out of the Arabian tales, I might get
my house ready at a day's warning; especially as it will not be
quite so lofty as the triumphal arch at Florence.

What you say you have heard of strange conspiracies, fomented
by our nephew(378) is not entirely groundless.  A Dr.
Cameron(379) has been seized in Scotland, who certainly came
over with commission to feel the ground.  He is brought to
London; but nobody troubles their head about him, or any thing
else, but Newmarket, where the Duke is at present making a
campaign, with half the nobility and half the money of England
attending him: they really say, that not less than a hundred
thousand pounds have been carried thither for the hazard of this
single week.  The palace has been furnished for him from the
great wardrobe, though the chief person(380) concerned flatters
himself that his son is at the expense of his own amusement
there.


I must now tell you how I have been treated by an old friend of
yours--don't be frightened, and conclude that this will make
against your friend San Severino: he is only a private prince;
the rogue in Question is a monarch.  Your brother has sent you
some weekly papers that are much in fashion, called "The
World;" three or four of them are by a friend of yours; one
particularly I wrote to promote a subscription for King
Theodore, who is in prison for debt.  His Majesty's character
is so bad, that it only raised fifty pounds; and though that
was so much above his desert, it was so much below his
expectation, that he sent a solicitor to threaten the printer
with a prosecution for having taken so much liberty with his
name--take notice too, that he had accepted the money! Dodsley,
you may believe, laughed at the lawyer; but that does not
lessen the dirty knavery.  It would indeed have made an
excellent suit! a printer prosecuted suppose for having
solicited and obtained charity for a man in prison, and that
man not mentioned by his right name, but by a mock title, and
the man himself not a native of the country!--but I have done
with countenancing kings!

Lord Bath has contributed a paper to the World, but seems to
have entirely lost all his wit and genius: it is a plain heavy
description of Newmarket, with scarce an effort towards
humour.(381)  I had conceived the greatest expectations from a
production of his, especially in the way of the Spectator; but
I M now assured by Franklyn, the old printer of the Craftsman,
(who by a comical revolution of things, is a tenant of mine at
Twickenham,) that Lord Bath never wrote a Craftsman himself,
only gave hints for them--yet great part of his reputation was
built on those papers.  Next week my Lord chesterfield appears
in the World(382)--I expect much less from him than I did from
Lord Bath, but it is very certain that his name will make it
applauded.  Adieu!

P.S. Since I came to town, I hear that my Lord Granville has
cut another colt's tooth-in short, they say he is going to be
married again; it is to Lady Juliana Collier,(383) a very
pretty girl, daughter of Lord Portmore: there are not above two
or three and forty years difference in their ages, and not
above three bottles difference in @ their drinking in a day, so
it is a very suitable match! She will not make so good a Queen
as our friend Sophia, but will like better, I suppose, to make
a widow.  If this should not turn out true,(384) I can't help
it.

(379) This is a strange story, and it is difficult to believe
that the King of Prussia was concerned in it.  In his Memoires,
Walpole gives the following account of the taking of Dr.
Cameron:--"About this time was taken in Scotland, Dr. Archibald
Cameron, a man excepted by the act of indemnity.  Intelligence
had been received some time before of his intended journey to
Britain, with a commission from Prussia to offer arms to the
disaffected Highlanders, at the same time that ships were
hiring in the north to transport men.  The fairness of Dr.
Cameron's character, compared with the severity he met from a
government most laudably mild to its enemies, confirmed this
report.  That Prussia, who opened its inhospitable arms to
every British rebel, should have tampered in such a business,
was by no means improbable.  That King hated his uncle: but
could a Protestant potentate dip in designs for restoring a
popish government? Of what religion is policy? To what sect is
royal revenge bigoted? The Queen-dowager, though sister of our
King, was avowedly a Jacobite, by principle so-and it was
natural: what Prince, but the single one who profits by the
principle, can ever think it allowable to overturn sacred
hereditary right? It is the curse of sovereigns that their
crimes should be unpunishable."-D.

 164 Letter 76
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Strawberry Hill, May 5, 1753.

Though my letter bears a country date, I am only a passenger
here, just come to overlook my workmen, and repose myself upon
some shavings, after the fatigues of the season.  You know
balls and masquerades always abound as the weather be(,Ins to
be too hot for them, and this has been quite a spring-tide of
diversion.  Not that I am so abandoned as to have partaken of
all; I neither made the Newmarket campaign under the Duke, nor
danced at any ball, nor looked well at any masquerade: I begin
to submit to my years, and amuse myself-only just as much as I
like.  Indeed, when parties and politics are at an end, an
Englishman may be allowed not to b always grave and out of
humour.  His Royal Highness has won as many hearts at Newmarket
as he lost in Scotland; he played deep and handsomely; received
every body at his table with the greatest good humour, and
permitted the familiarities of the place with ease and sense.

There have been balls at the Duchess of Norfolk's, at
Holland-house, and Lord Granville's, and a subscription
masquerade: the dresses were not very fine, not much invention,
nor any very absurd.  I find I am telling you extreme trifles;
but you desired me to write; and there literally happens
nothing of greater moment.  If I can fill out a sheet even in
this way, I will; for at Sligo(385) perhaps I may appear a
journalist of consequence.

There is a Madame de Mezi`eres arrived from Paris, who has said
a thousand impertinent things to my Lady Albemarle, on my
lord's not letting her come to Paris.(386)  I should not repeat
this to you, only to introduce George Selwyn's account of this
woman who, he says, is mother to the Princess of Montauban,
grandmother to Madame de Brionne, sister to General Oglethorpe,
and was laundress to the Duchess of Portsmouth.

Sir Charles Williams, never very happy at panegyric, has made a
distich on the Queen of Hungary, which I send you for the
curiosity, not the merit of it:

"O regina orbis prima et pulcherrima, ridens
Es Venus, incedens Juno, Minerva loquens."

It is infinitely admired at Vienna, but Baron Munchausen has
received a translation of it into German in six verses, which
are still more applauded.

There is another volume published of Lord Bolinbroke's: it
contains his famous Letter to Sir William Windham, with an
admirable description of the Pretender and hi Court, and a very
poor justification of his own treachery to that party; a flimsy
unfinished State of the Nation, written at the end of his life,
and the commonplace tautology of an old politician, who lives out
of the world and writes from newspapers; and a superficial letter
to Mr. Pope, as an introduction to his Essays, which are printed,
but not yet published.

What shall I say to you more? You see how I am forced to tack
paragraphs together, without any connexion or consequence!
Shall I tell you one more idle story, and will you just
recollect that you once concerned yourself enough about the
heroine of it, to excuse my repeating such a piece of
tittle-tattle? This heroine is Lady Harrington, the hero is--
not entirely of royal blood; at least I have never heard that
Lodomie, the toothdrawer, was in any manner descended from the
house of Bourbon.  Don't be alarmed: this plebeian operator is
not in the catalogue of your successors.  How the lady was the
aggressor is not known; 'tis only conjectured that French
politeness and French interestedness could never have gone such
lengths without mighty provocation.  The first instance of the
toothdrawer's un-gentle behaviour was on hearing it said that
Lady Harrington was to have her four girls drawn by Liotard;
which was wondered at, as his price is so great--"Oh!" said
Lodomie, "chacune paie pour la sienne."  Soon after this
insult, there was some dispute about payments and toothpowder,
and divers messages passed.  At last the lady wrote a card, to
say she did not understand such impertinent answers being given
to her chairman by an arracheur de dents.  The angry little
gentleman, with as much intrepidity as if he had drawn out all
her teeth, tore the card in five slits, and returned it with
this astonishing sentence, "I return you your impertinent card,
and desire you will pay me what you owe me." All I know more
is, that the toothdrawer still lives; and so do many lords and
gentlemen, formerly thought the slaves of the offended fair
one's will and passions, and among others, to his great shame,
your sincere friend.

(385) Mr. Conway was then with his regiment quartered at Sligo
in Ireland.

(386) Lord Albemarle was then ambassador at Paris.



165 Letter 77
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, May 22, 1753.

You may very possibly be set out for Greatworth, but what house
Greatworth is, or whose, or how you came to have it, is all a
profound secret to us: your transitions arc so Pindaric, that,
without notes, we do not understand them, especially as neither
Mr. Bentley nor I have seen any of the letters, which I suppose
you have written to your family in the intervals of your
journeyings from Sir Jonathan Cope's(387) to Roel, and from
Roel to Greatworth.  Mr. Bentley was just ready to send you
down a packet of Gothic, and brick and mortar, and arched
windows, and taper columns to be erected at Roel--no such
matter, you have met with some brave chambers belonging to Sir
Jonathan somebody in Northamptonshire, and are unloading your
camels and caravan,.;, and pitching your tents among your own
tribe.  I cannot be quite sorry, for I shall certainly visit
you at Greatworth, and it might have been some years before the
curtain had drawn up at Roel.  We emerge very fast out of
shavings, and hammerings, and pastings; the painted glass is
full-blown in every window, and the gorgeous saints, that were
brought out for one day on the festival of Saint George
Montagu, are fixed for ever in the tabernacles they are to
inhabit.- The castle is not the only beauty: and to-day we had
a glimpse of the sun as he passed by, though I am convinced the
summer is over; for these two last years we have been forced to
compound for five hot days in the pound.

News there is none to tell you.  We had two days in the House
of Commons, that had something of the air of Parliament; there
has been a Marriage-bill, invented by my Lord Bath, and cooked
up by the Chancellor, which was warmly opposed by the Duke of
Bedford in the Lords, and with us by Fox and Nugent: the latter
made an admirable speech last week against it, and Charles
Townshend,(388) another very good one yesterday, when we sat
till near ten o'clock, but were beat, we minority, by 165 to
84.

I know nothing else but elopements: I have lost my man Henry,
who is run away for debt; and my Lord Bath his only son. who is
run away from thirty thousand pounds a-year, which in all
probability would have come to him in six months.  There had
been some great fracas about his marriage; the stories are
various on the Why; some say his father told Miss Nichols that
his son was a very worthless young man; others, that the Earl
could not bring himself to make tolerable settlements; and a
third party say, that the Countess has blown up a quarrel in
order to have his son in her power, and at her mercy.  Whatever
the cause was, this ingenious young man, who You know has made
my Lady Townshend his everlasting enemy, by repeating her
histories of Miss Chudleigh to that Miss, of all counsellors in
the world, picked out my Lady Townshend to consult on his
domestic grievances: she, with all the good-nature and charity
imaginable, immediately advised him to be disinherited.  He
took her advice, left two dutiful letters for his parents, to
notify 'his disobedience, and went off last Friday night to
France.  The Earl is so angry, that he could almost bring
himself to give Mr. Newport, and twenty other people, their
estates again.  Good night--here is the Goth, Mr. Bentley,
wants to say a word to you.

"Dear Sir,
Wrote you a supernumerary letter on Saturday, but as I find you
have shifted your quarters since I heard from 'YOU, imagine it
may not have reached you yet.  If you want to know what made me
so assiduous, it was to tell you Sir Danvers Osborn has kissed
hands for New York, that's all.  I am sincerely yours.

"P.S. I wish you Would write to him mentioning me, that's
more."

(387) At Brewern, in Oxfordshire.-E.

(388) Second son of the Marquis of Townshend.



167 Letter 78
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Strawberry Hill, May 24, 1753.

It is well you are married! How would my Lady Ailesbury have
liked to be asked in a parish church for three Sundays running?
I really believe she would have worn her weeds for ever, rather
than have passed through so impudent a ceremony! What do you
think?  But you will want to know the interpretation of this
preamble.  Why, there is a new bill, which, under the notion of
preventing clandestine marriages, has made such a general
rummage and reform in the office of matrimony that every
Strephon and Chloe, every dowager and her Hussey, will have as
many impediments and formalities to undergo as a treaty of
peace.  Lord Bath invented this bill,(389) but had drawn it so
ill, that the Chancellor was forced to draw a new one, and then
grew so fond of his own creature, that he has crammed it down
the throats of both Houses-though they gave many a gulp before
they could swallow it.  The Duke of Bedford attacked it first
with great spirit and mastery, but had little support, though
the Duke of Newcastle did not vote.  The lawyers were all
ordered to purse it through our House: but except the poor
Attorney-general,(390) "Who is nurse indeed. to all intents and
purposes, and did amply gossip over it, not one of them said a
word.  Nugent shone extremely in opposition to the bill, and,
though every now and then on the precipice of absurdity, kept
clear of it, with great humour and wit and argument, and was
unanswered-yet we were beat.  Last Monday it came into the
committee: Charles Townshend acted a very good speech with
great cleverness, and drew a picture of his own story and his
father's tyranny, with at least as much parts as modesty.  Mr.
Fox mumbled the Chancellor and his lawyers, and pinned the plan
of the bill upon a pamphlet he had found of Dr. Gally's,(391)
where the doctor, recommending the French scheme of matrimony,
says, "It was found that fathers were too apt to forgive." "The
Gospel, I thought," said Mr. Fox, "enjoined forgiveness; but
pious Dr. Gal] v thinks fathers are too apt to forgive." Mr.
Pelham, extremely in his opinion against the bill, and in his
inclination too, was forced to rivet it, and, without speaking
one word for it, taught the House how to vote for it; and it was
carried against the Chairman's leaving the chair by 165 to 84.
This Is all the news I know, or at least was all when I came out
of town; for I left the tinkering of the bill, and came hither
last Tuesday to my workmen.  I flatter myself I shall get into
tolerable order to receive my Lady Ailesbury and you at your
return from Sligo, from whence I have received 'your letter, and
where I hope you have had my first.  I say nothing of the exile
of the Parliament of Paris for I know no more than you will see
in the public papers; only, as we are going to choose a new
Parliament, we could not do better than choose the exiles: we
could scarce choose braver or honester men.  I say as little of
Mademoiselle Murphy,(392) for I conclude you hear nothing but her
health drank in whiskey.  Don't all the nailed Irish flatter
themselves with preferment, and claim relation with her?  Miss
Chudleigh says, there is some sense in belonging to a king who
turns off an old mistress when he has got a new one.

Arlington Street, May 29.

I am Come to town for a day or two, and find that the
Marriage-bill has not only lasted till now-in the committee,
but has produced, or at least disclosed, extreme heats.  Mr.
Fox and Mr. Pelham have had very high words on every clause,
and the former has renewed his attacks on the Chancellor under
the name of Dr. Gally.  Yesterday on the nullity clause they
sat till half an hour after three in the morning, having just
then had a division On adjournment, which was rejected by the
ministry by above 80 to 70.  The Speaker, who had spoken well
against the clause, was so misrepresented by the
Attorney-general, that there was danger of a skimmington
between the great wig and the coif, the former having given a
flat lie to the latter.  Mr. Fox I am told, outdid himself for
spirit, and severity on the Chancellor and the lawyers.  I say
I am told; for I was content with having been beat twice, and
did not attend.  The heats between the two ministers were far
from cooling by the length of the debate.  Adieu! You did
little expect in these times, and at this season, to have heard
such a parliamentary history! The bill is not near
finished;(393) Mr. Fox has declared he will dispute every inch
of ground.  I hope he won't be banished to Pontoise.(394)  I
shall write to you no more; so pray return.  I hear most
favourable accounts of my Lady Ailesbury.

(389) The following is Tindal's account of the origin of this
bill: "The fatal consequences of clandestine marriages had been
long complained of in England, as rendering the succession to
all property insecure and doubtful.  Every day produced
hearings of the most shocking kind in the court of Chancery,
and appeals in the House of Lords, concerning the validity of
such marriages; and sometimes the innocent offspring were cut
off from succession, though their parents had been married bona
fide, because of the irregularity of such marriage.  On the
other hand, both women and men of the most infamous characters
had opportunities of ruining the sons and daughters of the
greatest families in England, by conveniences of marrying in
the Fleet, and other unlicensed places; and marrying was now
become as much a trade as any mechanical profession."-E.

(390 Sir Dudley Ryder.

(391) Dr. Henry Gally, one of the King's chaplains in ordinary.
Besides the pamphlet here spoken of, which was entitled "Some
Considerations upon Clandestine Marriages," he wrote a
"Dissertation on Pronouncing the Greek Language," and several
other works He died in 1769.-E.

(392) An Irishwoman who was, for a short time, mistress to
Louis XV.


(393) "The opposition to the bill was such that few clauses
remained unaltered; and Mr. Fox, holding it up in the House, as
Antony exposed the murdered body of Caesar, made a kind of a
parody of the speech in Shakespeare upon that occasion."
Tindal.-E.

(394) The Parliament of Paris having espoused the clause of
religious liberty, and apprehended several priests who, by the
authority of the Archbishop of Paris and other prelates, had
refused the sacraments to those who would not subscribe to the
bull Unigunitus, were banished by Louis XV. to Pontoise.



169 Letter 79
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, June 11, 1753.

You will think me very fickle, and that I have but a slight
regard to the castle I am building for my ancestors, when you
hear that I have been these last eight days in London amid dust
and stinks, instead of seringa, roses, battlements, and niches;
but you perhaps recollect that I have another Gothic passion,
which is for squabbles in the Wittenagemot.(395)  I can't say
that the contests have run so high in either House as they have
sometimes done in former days, but this age has found out a new
method of parliamentary altercations.  The Commons abuse the
Barons, and the Barons return it; in short, Mr. Fox attacked
the Chancellor violently on the Marriage-bill; and when it was
sent back to the Lords, the Chancellor made the most outrageous
invectives on Fox that ever was heard.  But what offends still
more,--I don't mean offends Fox more,--was the Chancellor
describing the chief persons who had opposed his bill in the
Commons, and giving reason why he excused them.  As the speaker
was in the number of the excused, the two maces are ready to
come to blows.(396)  The town says Mr. Fox is to be dismissed,
but I can scarce think it will go so far.

My Lord Cornwallis is made an earl; Lord Bristol's sisters have
the rank of Earl's daughters; Damer is Lord Milton in Ireland,
and the new Lord Barnard is, I hear, to be Earl of Darlington.

Poor Lady Caroline Brand is dead of a rheumatic fever, and her
husband as miserable a man as ever he was a cheerful one: I
grieve much for her, and pity him; they were infinitely happy,
and lived in the most perfect friendship I ever saw.

You may be assured that I will pay you a visit some time this
summer, though not yet, as I cannot leave my workmen,
especially as we have a painter who paints the paper on the
staircase under Mr. Bentley's direction.  The armoury bespeaks
the ancient chivalry of the lords of the castle; and I have
filled Mr. Bentley's Gothic lanthorn with painted glass, which
casts the most venerable gloom on the stairs that ever was seen
since the days of Abelard.  The lanthorn itself, in which I
have stuck a coat of the Veres, is supposed to have come from
Castle Henningham.  Lord and Lady Vere were here t'other day, and
called cousins with it, and would very readily have invited it to
Hanworth; but her Portuguese blood has so blackened the true
stream that I could not bring myself to offer so fair a gift to
their chapel.

I shall only tell you a bon-mot of Keith's, the
marriage-broker, and conclude.  "G-d d-n the bishops!" said he,
(I beg Miss Montagu's pardon,) "so they will hinder my
marrying.  Well, let 'em; but I'll be revenged!  I'll buy two
or three acres of ground, and, by G-d! I'll underbury them
all!"  Adieu!

(395) The name of the Saxon great council, the supposed origin
of parliaments.

(396) Among the Hardwicke papers there is a letter from Dr.
Birch to the Hon.  Philip Yorke, giving an account of the
debate in the House of Lords.  The following is an extract:--
"My Lord Chancellor expressed his surprise, that the bill
should have been styled out of doors an absurd, a cruel, a
scandalous, and a wicked one.  With regard to his own share in
this torrent of abuse, as he was obliged to those who had so
honourably defended him, so,' said he, 'I despise the
invective, and I despise the retractation; I despise the
scurrility, and I reject the adulation.' Mr. Fox was not
present, but had soon an account of what had passed; for the
same evening, being at Vauxhall with some ladies, he broke from
them, and collecting a little circle of young members of
parliament and others, told them with great eagerness, that he
wished the session had continued a fortnight longer, for then
he would have made ample returns to the Lord Chancellor.  The
Speaker talks of my Lord Chancellor's speech in the style of
Mr. Fox, as deserving of the notice of the Commons, if they had
not been prorogued."-E.



170 Letter 80
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, June 12, 1753.

I could not rest any longer with the thought of your having no
idea of a place of which you hear so much, and therefore
desired Mr. Bentley to draw you as much idea of it as the post
would be persuaded to carry from Twickenham to Florence.  The
enclosed enchanted little landscape, then, is Strawberry Hill;
and I will try to explain so much of it to you as will help to
let you know whereabouts we are when we are talking to you; for
it is uncomfortable in so intimate a correspondence as ours not
to be exactly master of every spot where one another is
writing, or reading, or sauntering.  This view of the
castle(397) is what I have just finished, and is the only side
that will be at all regular.  Directly before it is an open
grove, through which you see a field, which is bounded by a
serpentine wood of all kind of trees, and flowering shrubs, and
flowers! The lawn before the house is situated on the top of a
small hill, from whence to the left you see the town and church
of Twickenham encircling a turn of the river, that looks
exactly like a seaport in miniature.  The opposite shore is a
most delicious meadow, bounded by Richmond Hill, which loses
itself in the noble woods of the park to the end of the
prospect on the right, where is another turn of the river, and
the suburbs of Kingston as luckily placed as Twickenham is on
the left; and a natural terrace on the brow of my hill, with
meadows of my own down to the river, commands both extremities.
Is not this a tolerable prospect? You must figure that all this
is perpetually enlivened by a navigation of boats and barges,
and by a road below my terrace, with coaches, post-chaises,
wagons, and horsemen constantly in motion, and the fields
speckled with cows, horses, and sheep.  Now you shall walk into
the house.  The bow-window below leads into a little parlour
hung with a stone-colour Gothic paper and Jackson's Venetian
prints, which I could never endure while they pretended,
infamous as they are, to be after Titian, etc., but when I gave
them this air of barbarous basreliefs, they succeeded to a
miracle: it is impossible at first sight not to conclude
that they contain the history of Attila or Tottila, done about
the very aera.  From hence, under two gloomy arches, you come
to the hall and staircase, which it is impossible to describe
to you, as it is the most particular and chief beauty of the
castle.  Imagine the walls covered with (I call it paper, but
it is really paper painted in perspective to represent) Gothic
fretwork: the lightest Gothic balustrade to the staircase,
adorned with antelopes (our supporters) bearing shields lean
windows fattened with rich saints in painted glass, and a
vestibule open with three arches on the landing-place, and
niches full of trophies of old coats of mail, Indian shields
made of rhinoceros's hides, broadswords, quivers, long bows,
arrows, and spears--all supposed to be taken by Mr Terry
Robsart(398) in the holy wars.  But as none of' this regards
the enclosed drawing, I will pass to that.  The room on the
ground-floor nearest to you is a bedchamber, hung with yellow
paper and prints, framed in a new manner, invented by Lord
Cardigan; that is, with black and white borders printed.  Over
this is Mr. Chute's bedchamber, hung with red in the same
manner.  The bow-window room one pair of stairs is not yet
finished; but in the tower beyond it is the charming closet
where I am now writing to you.  It is hung with green paper and
water-colour pictures; has two windows; the one in the drawing
looks to the garden, the other to the beautiful prospect; and
the top of each glutted with the richest painted glass of the
arms of England, crimson roses, and twenty other pieces of
green, purple, and historic bits.  I must tell you, by the way,
that the castle, when finished, will have two-and-thirty
windows enriched with painted glass.  In this closet, which is
Mr. Chute's college of arms, are two presses with books of
heraldry and antiquities, Madame Sevign`e's Letters, and any
French books that relate to her and her acquaintance.  Out of
this closet is the room where we always live, hung with a blue
and white paper in stripes adorned with festoons, and a
thousand plump chairs, couches, and luxurious settees covered
with linen of the same pattern, and with a bow-window
commanding the prospect, and gloomed with limes that shade half
each window, already darkened with painted glass in
chiaroscuro, set in deep blue glass.  Under this room is a cool
little hall, where we generally dine, hung with paper to
imitate Dutch tiles.

I have described so much, that you will begin to think that all
the accounts I used to give you of the diminutiveness of our
habitation were fabulous; but it is really incredible how small
most of the rooms are.  The Only two good chambers I shall have
are not yet built; they will be an eating-room and a library,
each twenty by thirty, and the latter fifteen feet high.  For
the rest of the house, I could send it you in this letter as
easily as the drawing, only that I should have no where to live
till the return of the post.  The Chinese summer-house which
you may distinguish in the distant landscape, belongs to my Lord
Radnor.  We pique ourselves upon nothing but simplicity, and have
no carvings, gildings, paintings, inlayings, or tawdry
businesses.

You will not be sorry, I believe,. by this time to have done
with Strawberry Hill, and to hear a little news.  The end of a
very dreaming session has been extremely enlivened by an
accidental bill which has opened great quarrels, and those not
unlikely to be attended with interesting circumstances.  A bill
to prevent clandestine marriages, so drawn by the Judges as to
clog all matrimony in general, was inadvertently espoused by
the Chancellor; and having been strongly attacked in the House
of Commons by Nugent, the Speaker, Mr. Fox, and others, the
last went very great lengths of severity on the whole body of
the law, and on its chieftain in particular-, which, however,
at the last reading, he softened and explained off extremely.
This did not ,appease; but on the return of the bill to the
House of Lords, where our amendments were to be read, the
Chancellor in the most personal terms harangued against Fox,
and concluded with saying that "he despised his scurrility as
much as his adulation and recantation."  As Christian charity
is not one of the oaths taken by privy-counsellors, and as it
is not the most eminent virtue in either of the champions, this
quarrel is not likely to be soon reconciled.  There are
natures(399) whose disposition it is to patch up political
breaches, but whether they will succeed, or try to succeed in
healing this, can I tell you?

The match for Lord Granville, which I announced to you, is not
concluded: his flames are cooled in that quarter as well as in
others.

I begin a new sheet to you, which does not match with the
other, for I have no more of the same paper here.  Dr. Cameron
is executed, and died with the greatest firmness.  His parting
with his wife the night before was heroic and tender: he let
her stay till the last moment, when being aware that the gates
of the Tower would be locked, he told her so; she fell at his
feet in agonies: he said, "Madam, this was not what you
promised me," and embracing her, forced her to retire; then
with the same coolness, looked at the window till her coach was
out of sight, after which he turned about and wept.  His only
concern seemed to be at the ignominy of Tyburn: he was not
disturbed at the dresser for his body, or at the fire to burn
his bowels.(400)  The crowd was so great, that a friend who
attended him could not get away, but was forced to stay and
behold the execution: but what will you say to the minister or
priest who accompanied him? The wretch, after taking leave,
went into a landau, where, not content with seeing the Doctor
hanged, he let down the top of the landau for the better
convenience of seeing him embowelled! I cannot tell you
positively that what I hinted of this Cameron being commissioned
from Prussia was true, but so it is believed.  Adieu! my dear
child; I think this is a very tolerable letter for summer!

(397) It was a view of the south side towards the northeast.

(398) An ancestor of Sir Robert Walpole, who was knight of the
garter.

(399) An allusion to Mr. Pelham.

(400) "The populace," says Smollet, though not very subject to
tender emotions, were moved to compassion, and even to tears,
by his behaviour at the place of execution; and many sincere
well-wishers to the present establishment thought that the
sacrifice of this victim, at such a juncture, could not redound
either to its honour or security."-E.



173 Letter 81
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 17, 1753.

Dear sir,
You are so kind, that I am peevish with myself for not being
able to fix a positive day for being with you; as near as I can
guess, it will be some of the very first days of the next
month: I am engaged to go with Lady Ailesbury and Mr. Conway to
Stowe, the 28th of this month, if some little business which I
have here does not prevent me; and from thence I propose to
meet Mr. Chute at Greatworth.  If this should at all interfere
with your schemes, tell me so; especially, I must beg that you
would not so far depend on me as to stay one minute from doing
any thing else you like, because it is quite impossible for me
to be sure that I can execute just at the time I propose such
agreeable projects.  Meeting Mrs. Trevor will be a principal
part of my pleasure; but the summer shall certainly not pass
without my seeing you.

You will, I am sure, be concerned to hear that your favourite,
Miss Brown, the pretty Catholic, who lived with Madame
d'Acunha, is dead at Paris, by the ignorance of the physician.
Tom Harvey, who always obliges the town with a quarrel in a
dead season, has published a delightful letter to Sir William
Bunbury,(401) full of madness and wit.  He had given the Doctor
a precedent for a clergyman's fighting a duel, and I furnished
him with another story of the same kind, that diverted him
extremely.  A Dr. Suckling, who married a niece of my father,
quarrelled with a country squire, who said, "Doctor, your gown
is your protection."  "Is it so?" replied the parson; "but, by
God! it shall not be yours;" pulled it off, and thrashed him--I
was going to say damnably, at least, divinely.  Do but think,
my Lord Coke and Tom Harvey are both bound to the peace, and
are always going to fight together: how comfortable for their
sureties!

My Lord Pomfret is dead; George Selwyn says, that my Lord
Ashburnham(402) is not more glad to get into the parks than
Lord Falkland is to get out of them.  You know he was forced to
live in a privileged place.

Jack Hill(403) is dead too, and has dropped about a hundred
legacies; a thousand pound to the Dowager of Rockingham; as
much, with all his plate and china, to her sister Bel.  I don't
find that my uncle has got so much as a case of knives and forks,
he always paid great court, but Mary Magdalen, my aunt, undid all
by scolding the man, and her spouse durst not take his part.

Lady Anne Paulett's daughter is eloped with a country
clergyman.  The Duchess of Argyle Harangues against the
Marriage-bill not taking place immediately, and is persuaded
that all the girls will go off before next lady-day.

Before I finish, I must describe to you the manner in which I
overtook Monsieur le Duc de Mirepoix t'other day, who lives at
Lord Dunkeron's house at Turnham-green.  It was seven o'clock
in the evening of one of the hottest and most dusty days of
this summer.  He was walking slowly in the beau milieu of
Brentford town, without any company, but with a brown lap-dog
with long ears, two pointers, two pages, three footmen, and a
vis-a-vis following him.  By the best accounts I can get, he
must have been to survey the ground of the battle of Brentford,
which I hear he has much studied, and harangues upon.

Adieu! I enclose a World' to you, which, by a story I shall
tell you, I find is called mine.  I met Mrs. Clive two nights
ago, and told her I had been in the meadows, but would walk no
more there, for there was all the world. "Well," says she, "and
don't you like the World!(404) I hear it was very clever last
Thursday."  All I know is, that you will meet with some of your
acquaintance there.  Good night, with my compliments to Miss
Montagu.


(401) The Rev.  Sir William Bunbury, father of Sir Charles, and
of Henry, the celebrated caricaturist.-E.

(402) Lord Ashburnham succeeded Lord Pomfret as ranger of St.
James's and Hyde Parks.

(403) Member for Higham Ferrers.

(404) No. 28, entitled " Old women most proper objects for
love."  Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, in a letter to her daughter,
says, "Send me no translations, no periodical papers; though I
confess some of The World' entertained me very much,
particularly Lord Chesterfield and Horry Walpole; but whenever
I met Dodsley, I wished him out of the World with all my heart.
The title was a very lucky one, being, as you see, productive
of puns world without end; which is all the species of wit some
people can either practise or understand."-E.



174 Letter 82
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, July 21, 1753.

Though I have long had a letter of yours unanswered, yet I
verily think it would have remained so a little longer, if the
pretty altar-tomb which you have sent me had not roused my
Gratitude.  It arrived here--I mean the tomb, not my
gratitude--yesterday, and this morning churchyarded itself in
the corner of my wood, where I hope it will remain till some
future virtuoso shall dig it up, and publish 'it in " A
Collection of Roman Antiquities in Britain.  It is the very
thing I wanted: how could you, my dear Sir, take such exact
measure of my idea? By the way, you have never told me the
price; don't neglect it, that I nay pay your brother.

I told you how ill disposed I was to write to you, and you must
know without my telling you that the only reason of that could
be my not knowing a tittle worth mentioning; nay, not a tittle,
worth or not.  All England is gone over all England
electioneering: the spirit is as great now they are all on one
side, as when parties ran the highest.  You judge how little I
trouble myself about all this; especially when the question is
not who shall be in the ministry, only who shall be in the
House.

I am almost inclined not to say a word to your last letter,
because if I begin to answer it, it must be by scolding you for
making SO serious an affair of leaving off snuff; one would
think you was to quit a vice, not a trick.  Consider, child,
you are in Italy, not in England: here you would be very
fashionable by having so many nerves, and you might have
doctors and waters for every One Of them, from Dr. Mead to Dr.
Thompson, and from Bath to the iron pear-tree water.  I should
sooner have expected to hear that good Dr. Cocchi(405) was in
the Inquisition than in prescribing to a
snuff-twitter-nerve-fever!  You say people tell you that
leaving off snuff all at once may be attended with bad
consequences--I can't conceive what bad consequences, but to
the snuff-shop, who, I conclude by your lamentations, must have
sold you tolerable quantities; and I know what effects any
diversion of money has upon the tobacco-trade in Tuscany.  I
forget how much it was that the duty sank at Florence in a
fortnight after the erection of the first lottery, by the poor
people abridging themselves of snuff to buy tickets; but I
think I have said enough, considering I don't intend to scold.

Thank you for your civilities to Mr. Stephens; not at all for
those to Mr. Perry,(406) who has availed himself of the
partiality which he found you had for me, and passed Upon you
for my friend.  I never spoke one word to him in my life, but
when he went out of his own dressing-room at Penshurst that Mr.
Chute and I might see it, and then I said, "Sir, I hope we
don't disturb you;" he grunted something, and walked away--la
belle amiti`e!--yet, my dear child, I thank you, who receive
bad money when it is called My coin.  I Wish YOU had liked my
Lady Rochford's beauty more: I intended it should return well
preserved: I grow old enough to be piqued for the charms of my
contemporaries.

Lord Pomfret(407) is dead, not a thousand pound in debt.  The
Countess has two thousand a-year rent-charge for jointure, five
hundred as lady of the bedchamber to the late Queen, and
fourteen thousand pounds in money, in her own power, just
recovered by a lawsuit-what a fund for follies! The new Earl
has about two thousand four hundred pounds a-year in present
but deep debts and post-obits.  He has not put on mourning, but
robes; that is, in the middle of this very hot summer, he has
produced himself in a suit of crimson velvet, that he may be
sure of not being mistaken for being in weepers.  There are
rents worth ten thousand pounds left to little Lady Sophia
Carteret,(408) and the whole personal estate between the two
unmarried daughters;(409) so the seat(410) must be stripped.
There are a few fine small pictures, and one(411) very curious
One of Henry VII. and his Queen, with Cardinal Morton, and, I
think, the Abbot of Westminster.  Strawberry casts a Gothic eye
upon this, but I fear it will pass our revenues.  The
statues,(412) which were part of the Arundel collection, are
famous, but few good.  The Cicero is fine and celebrated: the
Marius I think still finer.  The rest are Scipios,
Cincinnatus's and the Lord knows who, which have lost more of
their little value than of their false pretensions by living
out of doors; and there is a green-house full of colossal
fragments.  Adieu! Have you received the description and
portrait of my castle?

(405) he was a very free thinker, and suspected by the
Inquisition.

(406) He married one of the coheiresses of the Sidneys, Earls
of Leicester.

(407) Thomas Fermor, first Earl of Pomfret, so created in 1721.
He had ben master of the horse to Queen Caroline, and ranger of
St. James's Park-D.

(408) Daughter of John, Earl of Granville, by his second wife,
eldest daughter of Thomas Fermor, Earl of Pomfret. (Afterwards
married to William Petty, Earl of Shelburne and Marquis of
Lansdowne.-D.)

(409) Lady Louisa and Lady Anne; the latter was afterwards
married to Mr. Dawson.

(410) Easton Neston, in Northamptonshire.

(411) It is the marriage of Henry VII. and Elizabeth of York.
The two other figures are probably St. Thomas and the Bishop of
linola, the Pope's nuncio, who pronounced the nuptial
benediction.  This curious picture was purchased by Lady
Pomfret for two hundred pounds.  The Earl of Oxford offered her
five hundred pounds for it: Mr. Walpole bought it at Lord
Pomfret's sale for eighty-four guineas, and it is now at
Strawberry Hill.

(412) Lady Pomfret bought the statues, after her lord's death,
and presented them to the University of Oxford.



176 Letter 83
To John Chute, Esq.
Stowe, Aug. 4, 1753

My dear Sir,
You would deserve to be scolded, if you had not lost almost as
much pleasure as you have disappointed me of.(413)  Whether
George Montagu will be so content With your commuting
punishments, I don't know: I should think not; he "cried and
roared all night"(414) when I delivered your excuse.  He is
extremely well-housed, after having roamed like a Tartar about
the country with his whole personal estate at his heels. .
There is an extensive view, which is called pretty: but
Northamptonshire is no county to please me.  What entertained
me was, that he who in London -,vas grown an absolute recluse,
is over head and ears in neighbours, and as popular as if he
intended to stand for the county, instead of having given up
the town.  The very first morning after my arrival, as we were
getting into the chaise to go to Wroxton, they notified a Sir
Harry Danvers, a young squire, booted and spurred, and
buckskin-breeche'd.  "Will you drink any chocolate?"  "No; a
little wine and water, if you please."--I suspected nothing but
that he had rode till he was dry.  "Nicol`o, some wine and
water."  He desired the water might be warm--I began to stare;
Montagu understood the dialect, and ordered a negus.  I had
great difficulty to keep my countenance, and still more when I
saw the baronet finish a very large jug indeed.  To be sure, he
wondered as much at me e who did not finish a jug; and I could
not help reflecting, that living always in the world makes one
as unfit for living out of it, as always living out of it does
for living in it.  Knightley, the knight of the shire, has been
entertaining all the parishes round with a turtle-feast, which,
so far from succeeding, has almost made him suspected for a
Jeu,, as the country parsons have not yet learned to wade into
green fat.

The roads are very bad to Greatworth; and such numbers of
gates, that if one loved punning one should call it the
Gate-house. - The proprietor had a wonderful invention: the
chimneys, which are of stone, have niches and benches in them,
where the man used to sit and smoke.  I had twenty disasters,
according to custom; lost my way, and had my French boy almost
killed by a fall with his horse: but I have been much pleased.
When I was at Park-place I went to see Sir H.
Englefield's,(415) which Mr. Churchill and Lady Mary prefer,
but I think very undeservedly, to Mr. Southcote's.  It is not
above a quarter as extensive, and wants the river.  There is a
pretty view of Reading seen under a rude arch, and the water is
well disposed.  The buildings are very insignificant, and the
house far from good.  The town of Henley has been extremely
disturbed with an engagement between the ghosts of Miss Blandy
and her father, which continued so violent, that some bold
persons, to prevent farther blood-shed, broke in, and found it
was two jackasses which had got into the kitchen.

I felt strangely tempted to stay at Oxford and survey it at my
leisure; but as I was alone, I had not courage.  I passed by
Sir James Dashwood'S,(416) a vast new house, situated so high
that it seems to stand for the county as well as himself.  I
did look over Lord Jersey's(417) which was built for a
hunting-box, and is still little better.  But now I am going to
tell you how delightful a day I passed at Wroxton.  Lord
Guildford has made George Montagu so absolutely viceroy over
it, that we saw it more agreeable than you can conceive; roamed
over the whole house, found every door open, saw not a
creature, had an extreme good dinner, wine, fruit, coffee and
tea in the library, were served by fairies, tumbled over the
books, said one or two talismanic words, and the cascade
played, and went home loaded with pine-apples and flowers.--You
will take me for Monsieur de CoulangeS,(418) I describe
eatables so feelingly; but the manner in which we were served
made the whole delicious.  The house was built by a Lord Downe
in the reign of James the First; and though there is a fine
hall and a vast dining-room below, and as large a drawing-room
above, it is neither good nor agreeable; one end of the front
was never finished, and might have a good apartment.  The
library is added by this Lord, and is a pleasant chamber.
Except loads of portraits, there is no tolerable furniture.  A
whole-length of the first Earl of Downe is in the Bath-robes,
and has a coif under the hat and feather.  There is a charming
picture of Prince Henry about twelve years old, drawing his
sword to kill a stag, with a Lord Harrington; a good portrait
of Sir Owen Hopton,(419) 1390; your pious grandmother, my Lady
Dacre, which I think like you; some good Cornelius Johnsons; a
Lord North, by Riley, good; and an extreme fine portrait by him
of the Lord Keeper: I have never seen but few of the hand, but
most of them have been equal to Lely and the best of Sir
Godfrey.  There is too a curious portrait of Sir Thomas Pope,
the founder of Trinity College, Oxford, said to be by Holbein.
The chapel is new, but in a pretty Gothic taste, with a very
long window of painted glass, very tolerable.  The frieze is
pendent, just in the manner I propose for the eating-room at
Strawberry Hill.  Except one scene, which is indeed noble, I
cannot much commend the without-doors.  This scene consists of
a beautiful lake entirely shut in with wood: the head falls
into a fine cascade, and that into a serpentine river, over
which is a little Gothic seat like a round temple, lifted up by
a shaggy mount.  On an eminence in the park is an obelisk
erected to the honour and at the expense of "optimus" and 1,
munificentissimus"  the late Prince of Wales, "in loci
amoenitatem et memoriam advent`us ejus."  There are several
paltry Chinese buildings and bridges, which have the merit or
demerit of being the progenitors of a very numerous race all
over the kingdom: at least they were of the very first.  In the
church is a beautiful tomb of an Earl and Countess of Downe,
and the tower is in a good plain Gothic style, ind was once,
they tell you, still more beautiful; but Mr. Miller, who
designed it, unluckily once in his life happened to think
rather of beauty than of the water-tables, and so it fell down
the first winter.

On Wednesday morning we went to see a sweet little chapel at
Steane, built in 1620 by Sir Thomas Crewe, Speaker in the time
of the first James and Charles. Here are remains of the
mansion-house, but quite in ruins: the chapel is kept up by my
Lord Arran, the last of the race.  There are seven or eight
monuments.  On one is this epitaph, which I thought pretty
enough:

"Conjux, casta parens felix, matrona pudica;
Sara viro, mundo Martha, Maria Deo."

On another is the most affected inscription I ever saw, written
by two brothers on their sister: they say, "This agreeable
mortal translated her into immortality such a day:" but I could
not help laughing at one quaint expression, to which time has
given a droll sense: "She was a constant lover of the best."

I have been here these two days, extremely amused and charmed
indeed.  Wherever you stand you see an Albano landscape.  Half
as many buildings I believe would be too many, but such a
profusion gives inexpressible richness.  You may imagine I have
some private reflections entertaining enough, not very
communicable to the company: the Temple of Friendship, in
which, among twenty memorandums of quarrels, is the bust of Mr.
Pitt: Mr. James Grenville is now in the house, whom his uncle
disinherited for his attachment to that very Pylades, Mr. Pitt.
He broke with Mr. Pope, who is deified in the Elysian fields,
before the inscription for his head was finished.  That of Sir
John Barnard, which was bespoke by the name of a bust of my
Lord Mayor, was by a mistake of the sculptor done for Alderman
Perry.  The statue of the King, and that "honori, laudi,
virtuti divae Carolinae," make one smile, when one sees the
ceiling where Britannia rejects and hides the reign of King * *
* * But I have no patience at building and planting a satire!
Such is the temple of modern virtue in ruins!  The Grecian
temple is glorious: this I openly worship: in the heretical
corner of my heart I adore the Gothic building, which by some
unusual inspiration Gibbs had made pure and beautiful and
venerable.  The style has a propensity to the Venetian or
mosque Gothic, and the great column near it makes the whole put
one in mind of the Place of St. Mark.  The windows are
throughout consecrated with painted glass; most of it from the
priory at Warwick, a present from that foolish Greathead, who
quarrelled with me (because his father was a gardener) for
asking him if Lord Brook had planted much--Apropos to painted
glass.  I forgot to tell you of a sweet house which Mr. Montagu
carried me to see, belonging to a Mr. Holman, a Catholic, and
called Warkworth.  The situation is pretty, the front charming,
composed of two round and two square towers.  The court within
is incomplete on one side; but above stairs is a vast gallery
with four bow-windows and twelve other large ones, all filled
with the arms of the old peers of England, with all their
quarterings entire.  You don't deserve, after deserting me,
that I should tempt you to such a sight; but this alone is
worth while to carry you to Greatworth.

Adieu, my dear Sir! I return to Strawberry to-morrow, and
forgive you enough not to deprive myself of the satisfaction of
seeing you there whenever you have nothing else to do.

179 Letter 84
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Aug. 16, 1753.

Don't you suspect, that I have not only forgot the pleasure I
had at Greatworth and Wroxton,(420) but the commissions you
gave me too?  It looks a little ungrateful not to have vented a
word of thanks; but I stayed to write till I could send you the
things, and when I had them, I stayed to send them by Mr.
Chute, who tells you by to-night's post when he will bring
them.  The butter-plate is not exactly what You ordered, but I
flatter myself you will like it as well.  There are a few
seeds; more shall follow at the end of the autumn.  Besides Tom
Harvey's letter, I have sent you maps of Oxfordshire and
Northamptonshire, having felt the want of them when I was with
you.  I found the road to Stowe above twelve miles, very bad,
and it took me up two hours and a half: but the formidable idea
I conceived of the breakfast and way of life there by no means
answered.  You was a prophet; it was very agreeable.  I am
ashamed to tell you that I laughed half an hour yesterday at
the sudden death of your new friend Sir Harry Danvers,(421)
"after a morning's airing," the news call it; I suspect it was
after a negus.  I found my garden brown and bare, but these
rains have recovered the green.  You may get your pond ready as
soon as you please; the gold fish swarm: Mr. Bentley carried a
dozen to town t'other day in a decanter.  You would be
entertained with our fishing; instead of nets, and rods and
lines, and worms, we use nothing but a pail and a basin and a
tea-strainer, which I persuade my neighbours is the Chinese
method.  Adieu! My best compliments to Miss Montagu.

P. S. Since writing my letter, I have received your twin
dispatches.  I am extremely sensible of the honour my Lord
Guildford does me, and beg you to transmit my gratitude to him:
if he is ever at Wroxton when I visit Greatworth, I shall
certainly wait upon him, and think myself happy in seeing that
charming place again.  As soon as I go to town, I shall send
for Moreland, and barbour your wardrobe with great pleasure.  I
find I must beg your pardon for laughing in the former part of
my letter about your baronet's death; but his "wine and water a
little warm" had left such a ridiculous effect upon me, that
even his death could not efface it.  Good night!  Mr. Miller
told me at Stowe, that the chimney-piece (I think from Steane)
was he believed at Banbury, but he did not know exactly.  If it
lies in your way to inquire, on so vague a direction, will you?
Mr. Chute may bring me a sketch of it.

(420) The seat of Lord Guilford.

(421) Of Culworth, in Oxfordshire.  He died at the age of
twenty-two.-E.



180 Letter 85
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, September, 1753.

My dear Sir,
I am going to send you another volume of my travels; I don't
know whether I shall not, at last, write a new Camden's
Britannia; but lest you should be afraid of my itinerary, I
will at least promise you that it shall not be quite so dry as
most surveys, which contain nothing but lists of impropriations
and glebes, and carucates, and transcripts out of Domesday, and
tell one nothing that is entertaining, describe no houses nor
parks, mention no curious pictures, but are fully satisfied if
they inform you that they believe that some nameless old tomb
belonged to a knight-templar, or one of the crusado, because he
lies cross-legged.  Another promise I will make you is, that my
love of abbeys shall not make me hate the Reformation till that
makes me grow a Jacobite, like the rest of my antiquarian
predecessors; of whom, Dart in particular wrote Billingsgate
against Cromwell and the regicides: and Sir Robert Atkins
concludes his summary of the Stuarts with saying, "that it is
no reason, because they have been so, that this family should
always continue unfortunate."

I have made my visit at Hagley,(422) as I intended.  On my way
I dined at Park-place, and lay at Oxford.  As I was quite
alone, I did not care to see any thing; but as soon as it was
dark I ventured out, and the moon rose as I was wandering among
the colleges, and gave me a charming venerable Gothic scene,
which was not lessened by the monkish appearance of the old
fellows stealing to their pleasures.  Birmingham is large, and
swarms with people and trade, but did not answer my expectation
from any beauty in it: yet, new as it is, I perceived how far I
was got back from the London hegira; for every alehouse is here
written mug-house, a name one has not heard of since the riots
in the late King's time.

As I got into Worcestershire, I opened upon a landscape of
country which I prefer even to Kent, which I had reckoned the
most beautiful county in England: but this, with all the
richness of Kent, is bounded with mountains.  Sir George
Lyttelton's house is immeasurably bad and old; one room at the
top of the house, which was reckoned a conceit in those days,
projects a vast way into the air.  There are two or three
curious pictures, and some of them extremely agreeable to me
for their relation to Grammont: there is le s`erieux
Lyttelton,(423) but too old for the date of that book;
Mademoiselle Stuart,(424) Lord Brounker, and Lady
Southesk;(425) besides, a portrait of Lord Clifford the
treasurer(426) with his staff, but drawn in armour (though no
soldier) out of flattery to Charles the Second, as he said the
most glorious part of his life was attending the King at the
battle of Worcester.  He might have said, that it was as
glorious as any part of his Majesty's life.  You might draw,
but I can't describe, the enchanting scenes of the park: it is
a hill of three miles, but broke into all manner of beauty;
such lawns, such wood, rills, cascades, and a thickness of
verdure quite to the summit of the hill, and commanding such a
vale of towns, and meadows, and woods extending quite to the
Black Mountain in Wales, that I quite forgot my favourite
Thames! Indeed, I prefer nothing to Hagley but Mount Edgecombe.
There is extreme taste in the park - the seats are not the
best, but there is not one absurdity.  There is a ruined
castle, built by Miller, that would get him his freedom even of
Strawberry: it has the true rust of the barons' wars.  Then
there is a scene of a small lake, with cascades falling down
such a Parnassus 1 with a circular temple on the distant
eminence; and there is such a fairy dale, with more cascades
gushing out of rocks! and there- is a hermitage, so exactly
like those in Sadeler's prints, on the brow of a shady
mountain, stealing peeps into the glorious world below; and
there is such a pretty well under a wood, like the Samaritan
woman's in a picture of Nicol`o Poussin! and there is such a
wood without the park, enjoying such a prospect! and there is
such a mountain on t'other side of the park commanding all
prospects, that I wore out my eyes with gazing, my feet with
climbing, and my tongue and my vocabulary with commending!  The
best notion I can give you of the satisfaction I showed, was,
that Sir George proposed to carry me to dine with my Lord
Foley; and when I showed reluctance, he said, "Why, I thought
you did not mind any strangers, if you were to see any thing!"
Think of my not minding strangers! I mind them so much, that I
missed seeing Hartlebury Castle, and the Bishop of Worcester's
chapel of painted glass there, because it was his public day
when I passed by his park.-Miller has built a Gothic house in
the village at Hagley for a relation of Sir George: but there
he is not more than Miller; in his castle he is almost Bentley.
There is a genteel tomb in the church to Sir George's first
wife,(427) with a Cupid and a pretty urn in the Roman style.

You will be diverted with my distresses at Worcester.  I set
out boldly to walk down the high-street to the cathedral: I
found it much more peopled than I intended, and, when I was
quite embarked, discovered myself up to the ears in a contested
election.  A new candidate had arrived the night before, and
turned all their heads.  Nothing comforted me, but that the
opposition is to Mr. Trevis; and I purchased my passage very
willingly with crying "No Trevis! No Jews!"  However, the inn
where I lay was Jerusalem itself, the very head-quarters where
Trevis the Pharisee was expected; and I had scarce got into my
room, before the victorious mob of his enemy, who had routed
his advanced guard, broke open the gates of our inn, and almost
murdered the ostler-and then carried him off to prison for
being murdered.  The cathedral is pretty, and has several
tombs, and clusters of light pillars of Derbyshire marble,
lately cleaned.  Gothicism and the restoration of that
architecture, and not of the bastard breed, spreads extremely
in this part of the world.  Prince Arthur's tomb, from whence
we took the paper for the hall and staircase, to my great
surprise. is on a less scale than the paper, and is not of
brass but stone, and that wretchedly whitewashed.  The niches
are very small, and the long slips in the middle are divided
every now and then with the trefoil.  There is a fine tomb for
Bishop Hough, in the Westminster Abbey style; but the obelisk
at the back is not loaded with a globe and a human figure, like
Mr. Kent's design for Sir Isatc Newton; an absurdity which
nothing but himself could surpass, when he placed three busts
at the foot of an altar-and, not content with that, placed them
at the very angles--where they have as little to do as they
have with Shakspeare.

>From Worcester I went to see Malvern Abbey.  It is situated
half way up an immense mountain of that name: the mountain is
very long, in shape like the prints of a whale's back: towards
the larger end lies the town.  Nothing remains but a beautiful
gateway and a church, which is very large: every window has
been glutted with painted glass, of which much remains, but it
did not answer; blue and red there is in abundance, and good
faces; but the portraits are so high, I could not distinguish
them.  Besides, the woman who showed me the church would pester
me with Christ and King David, when I was hunting for John of
Gaunt and King Edward.  The greatest curiosity, at least what I
had never seen before, was, the whole floor and far up the
sides of the church has been, if I may call it so, wainscoted
with red and yellow tiles, extremely polished, and diversified
with coats of arms, and inscriptions, and mosaic.  I have since
found the same at Gloucester, and have even been so fortunate
as to purchase from the sexton about a dozen, which think what
an acquisition for Strawberry! They are made of the natural
earth of the country, which is a rich red clay, that produces
every thing.  All the lanes are full of all kind of trees, and
enriched with large old apple-trees, that hang over from one
hedge to another.  Worcester city is large and pretty.
Gloucester city is still better situated, but worse built, and
not near so large.  About a mile from Worcester you break upon
a sweet view of the Severn.  A little farther on the banks is
Mr. Lechmere's house; but he has given strict charge to a troop
of willows never to let him see the river: to his right hand
extends the fairest meadow covered with cattle that ever you
saw - at the end of it is the town of Upton, with a church half
ruined and a bridge of six arches, which I believe with little
trouble he might see from his garden.

The vale increases in riches to Gloucester.  I stayed two days
at George Selwyn's house called Matson, which lies on Robin
Hood's Hill: it is lofty enough for an Alp, yet is a mountain
of turf to the very top, has wood scattered all over it,
springs that long to be cascades in twenty places of it: and
from the summit it beats even Sir George Lyttelton's views, by
having the city of Gloucester at its foot, and the Severn
widening to the horizon.  His house is small, but neat.  King
Charles lay here at the siege; and the Duke of York, with
typical fury, hacked and hewed the window-shutters of his
chamber, as a memorandum of his being there.  Here is a good
picture, of Dudley Earl of Leicester in his latter age, which
he gave to Sir Francis Walsingham, at whose house in Kent it
remained till removed hither; and what makes it very curious,
is, his age marked on it, fifty-four in 1572.  I had never been
able to discover before in what year he was born.  And here is
the very flower-pot and counterfeit association, for which
Bishop Sprat was taken up, and the Duke of Marlborough sent to
the tower.  The reservoirs on the hill supply the city.  The
late Mr. Selwyn governed the borough by them-and I believe by
some wine too.  The Bishop's house is pretty, and restored to
the Gothic by the late Bishop.  Price has painted a large
chapel-window for him, which is scarce inferior for colours,
and is a much better picture than any of the old glass.  The
eating-room is handsome.  As I am a Protestant Goth, I was glad
to worship Bishop Hooper's room, from whence he was led to the
stake: but I could almost have been a Hun, and set fire to the
front of the house, which is a small pert portico, like the
conveniences at the end of a London garden.  The outside of the
cathedral is beautifully light; the pillars in the nave
outrageously plump and heavy.  There is a tomb of one Abraham
Blackleach, a great curiosity; for, though the figures of him
and his wife are cumbent, they are very graceful, designed by
Vandyck, and well executed.  Kent designed the screen; but knew
no more there than he did any where else how to enter into the
true Gothic taste.  Sir Christopher Wren, who built the tower
of the great gateway at Christ Church, has catched the graces
of it as happily as you could do: there is particularly a niche
between two compartments of' a window, that is a masterpiece.

But here is a modernity, which beats all antiquities for
curiosity: just by the high altar is a small pew hung with
green damask, with curtains of the same; a small corner
cupboard, painted, carved, and gilt, for books, in one corner,
and two troughs of a bird-cage, with seeds and water.  If any
mayoress on earth was small enough to enclose herself in this
tabernacle, or abstemious enough to feed on rape and canary, I
should have sworn that it was the shrine of the queen of the
aldermen.  It belongs to a Mrs. Cotton, who, having lost a
favourite daughter, is convinced her soul is transmigrated into
a robin-redbreast; for which reason she passes her life in
making an aviary of the cathedral of Gloucester.  The chapter
indulge this whim, as she contributes abundantly to glaze,
whitewash, and ornament the church.

King Edward the Second's tomb is very light and in good repair.
The old wooden figure of Robert, the Conqueror's unfortunate
eldest son, is extremely genteel, and, though it may not be so
ancient as his death, is in a taste very superior to any thing
of much later ages. Our Lady's Chapel has a bold kind of
portal, and several ceilings of chapels, and tribunes in a
beautiful taste: but of all delight, is what they call the
abbot's cloister.  It is the very thing that you would build,
when you had extracted all the quintessence of trefoils,
arches, and lightness.  In the church is a star-window of eight
points, that is prettier than our rose-windows.

A little way from the town are the ruins of Lantony Priory:
there remains a pretty old gateway, which G. Selwyn has begged,
to erect on the top of his mountain, and it will have a
charming effect.

At Burford I saw the house of Mr. Lenthal the descendant of the
Speaker.  The front is good and a chapel connected by two or
three arches, which let the garden appear through, has a pretty
effect; but the inside of the mansion is bad and ill-furnished.
Except a famous picture of Sir Thomas More's family, the
portraits are rubbish, though celebrated.  I am told that the
Speaker, who really had a fine collection, made his peace by
presenting them to Cornbury, where they were well known, till
the Duke of Marlborough bought that seat.

I can't go and describe so known a place as Oxford, which I saw
pretty well on my return.  The whole air of the town charms me;
and what remains of the true Gothic un-Gibbs'd, and the
profusion of painted glass, were entertainment enough to me.
In the picture-gallery are quantities of portraits; but in
general they are not only not so much as copies, but proxies-so
totally unlike they arc to the persons they pretend to
represent.  All I will tell you more of Oxford is, that Fashion
has so far prevailed over her collegiate sister, Custom, that
they have altered the hour of dinner from twelve to one.  Does
not it put one in mind of reformations in religion? One don't
abolish Mahommedism; one only brings it back to where the
impostor himself left it.  I think it is at the
South-Sea-house, where they have been forced to alter the hour
of payment, instead of from ten to twelve, to from twelve to
two; so much do even moneyed citizens sail with the current of
idleness!

Was not I talking of religious sects? Methodism is quite
decayed in Oxford, its cradle.  In its stead, there prevails a
delightful fantastic system, called the sect of the
Hutchinsonians,(429) of whom one seldom hears any thing in
town.  After much inquiry, all I can discover is, that their
religion consists in driving Hebrew to its fountain-head, till
they find some word or other in every text of the Old
Testament, which may seem figurative of something in the New,
or at least of something, that may happen God knows when, in
consequence of the New.  As their doctrine is novel, and
requires much study, or at least much invention, one should
think that they could not have settled half the canon of what
they are to believe-and yet they go on zealously, trying to
make and succeeding in making converts.(429)  I could not help
smiling at the thoughts of etymological salvation; and I am
sure you will smile when I tell you, that according to their
gravest doctors, "Soap Is an excellent type of Jesus Christ,
and the York-buildings waterworks of the Trinity."--I don't
know whether this is not as entertaining as the passion of the
Moravians for the "little side-hole!"  Adieu, my dear sir!

(422) The seat of Sir George, afterwards Lord Lyttelton.-E.

(423) Sir Charles Lyttelton, distinguished in the M`emoires de
Grammont as "le s`erieux Lyttelton." He died in 1716, at the
age of eighty-six.-E.

(424) The beautiful Frances Stuart, who married Esme, Duke of
Richmond; which greatly displeased Charles the Second, who was
in love with her.

(425) Anne, daughter of William, second Duke of Hamilton, and
wife of Robert, third Earl of Southesk.-E.

(426) Sir Thomas Clifford, created Lord Clifford of Chudleigh.
He was one of "The Cabal."-E.

(427) Lucy, daughter of Hugh Fortescue, Esq. of Filleigh; upon
whose death, in 1746-7, Lord Lyttelton wrote his Celebrated
monody.-E.

(428) John Hutchinson, the founder of this sect, was born in
1674, and died in 1737, leaving a number of works on the Hebrew
language, which were collected in 1748, in twelve volumes
octavo.  He imagined all knowledge to be contained in the
Hebrew Scriptures, and, rejecting the points, he gave a
fanciful meaning to every one of the Hebrew letters.  He
possessed great mechanical skill, and invented a chronometer
for the discovery of the longitude, which was much approved by
Sir Isaac Newton.-E.

(429) Among his followers were the amiable Dr. Horne, Bishop of
Norwich, who published
an "Abstract" of his writings, and Parkhurst, the author of the
Hebrew Lexicon.-E.



186 Letter 86
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 6, 1753.

I fear the letter of July 21st, which you tell me you have
received, was the last I wrote.  I will make no more excuses
for my silence; I think they take up half my letters.  The time
of year must be full excuse; and this autumn is so dead a time,
that people even don't die.

You have puzzled me extremely by a paragraph in yours about one
Wilton, a sculptor, who, you say, is mentioned with encomiums
one of the Worlds:(430) I recollected no such thing.  The first
parcel your brother sends you shall convey the other numbers of
that paper, and I will mark all the names I know of the
authors: there are several, and of our first writers;(431) but
in general you will not find that the paper answers the idea
you have entertained of it.

I grieve for my Florentine friends, and for the doubling of
their yoke: the Count has shown great art.  I am totally
ignorant, not to say indifferent, about the Modenese
treaty;(432) indeed, I have none of that spirit which was
formerly so much objected to some of my family, the love of
negotiations during a settled peace.  Treaties within treaties
are very dull businesses: contracts of marriage between
baby-princes and miss-princesses give me no curiosity.  If I
had not seen it in the papers, I should never have known that
Master Tommy the Archduke was playing at marrying Miss Modena.
I am as sick of the hide-and-seek at which all Europe has been
playing about a King of the Romans! Forgive me, my dear child,
you who are a minister, for holding your important affairs so
cheap.  I amuse myself with Gothic and painted glass, and am as
grave about my own trifles as I could be at Ratisbon. I shall
tell you one or two events within my own very small sphere, and
you must call them a letter.  I believe I mentioned having made
a kind of armoury: my upper servant, who is full as dull as his
predecessor, whom you knew, Tom Barney, has had his head so
filled with arms, that the other day, when a man brought home
an old chimney-back, which I had bought for having belonged to
Harry VII, he came running in, and said, "Sir, Sir! here is a
man has brought some more armour!"

Last week, when I was in town, I went to pay a bill to the
glazier who fixed up the painted glass: I said, "Mr. Palmer,
you charge me seven shillings a-day for your man's work: I know
you give him but two shillings; and I am told that it is
impossible for him to earn seven shillings a-day."--"Why no,
Sir," replied be, "it is not that; but one must pay house-rent,
and one must eat, and one must wear."  I looked at him, and he
had on a blue silk waistcoat with an extremely broad gold lace.
I could not help smiling.  I turned round, and saw his own
portrait, and his wife's, and his son's.  "And I see," said I,
"one must sit for one's picture; I am very sorry that I am to
contribute for all you must do!"  Adieu! I gave you warning
that I had nothing to say.

(430) Mr. Mann mistook; I think it was in a paper called "The
Adventurer."

(431) Lord Chesterfield, Lord Bath, Mr. W. Whithed, Sir Charles
Williams, Mr. Soame Jennings, Mr. Cambridge, Mr. Coventry, etc.

(432) It was between the Empress-Queen and the Duke of Modena,
for settling the duchy of Milan on one of the little Archdukes,
on his marrying the Duke's granddaughter, and in the mean time
the Duke was made administrator of Milan.



 187 Letter 87
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec 6, 1753.

In a very long, and consequently a very agreeable letter, which
I received from you yesterday, you set me an example which I
despair of following, keeping up a correspondence with spirit
when the world furnishes no events.  I should not say no
events, for France is big with matter, but to talk of the
parliamentary wars of another country would be only
transcribing gazettes: and as to Prince Heracilus,(433) the
other phenomenon of the age, it is difficult to say much about
a person of whom one knows nothing at all.  The only scene,
that promises to Interest one, lies in Ireland, from whence we
are told that the Speaker's party has carried a question
against the Lord Lieutenant's; but no particulars are yet
arrived.  Foundations have formerly been laid in Ireland of
troubles that have spread hither: I have read somewhere this
old saw,

"He that would England win,
Must with Ireland-first begin."

The only novelty I know, and which is quite private history,
is, that there is a man(434) in the world, who has so much
obligingness and attention in his friendships, that in the
middle of public business, and teased to death with all kind of
commissions, and overrun with cubs and cubaccioni's of every
kind, he can for twelve years together remember any single
picture, or bust, or morsel of virtu, that a friend of his ever
liked; and what is forty times more extraordinary than this
circumstantial kindness, he remembers it just at the time when
others, who might be afflicted with as good a memory, would
take pains to forget it, that is, when it is to be
obtained:-exactly then this person goes and purchases the thing
in question, whips it on board a ship, and sends it to his
friend, in the manner in the world to make it most agreeable,
except that he makes it impossible to thank him, because you
must allow that one ought to be possessed of the same manner of
obliging, before one is worthy of thanking such a person.  I
don't know whether you will think this person so extraordinary
as I do; but I have one favour to beg; if you should ever hear
his name, which, for certain reasons, I can't tell you, let me
entreat you never to disclose it, for the world in general is
so much the reverse of him, that they would do nothing but
commend to him every thing they saw, in order to employ his
memory and generosity.  For this reason you will allow that the
prettiest action that ever was committed, ought not to be
published to all the world.

You, who love your friends, will not be sorry to hear a little
circumstance that concerns, in a tolerable manner, at least two
of them. The last of my mother's surviving brothers(435) is
dead, and dead without a will, and dead rich.  Mr. Conway and I
shall share about six thousand pounds apiece in common with his
brother and sister and my brother.  I only tell you this for a
momentary pleasure, for you are not a sort of person to
remember any thing relative to your friends beyond the present
instant!

After writing me two sheets of paper, not to mention the
episode of Bianca Capello, I know not how to have the
confidence to put an end to my letter already; and yet I must,
and you will admit the excuse: I have but just time to send my
brother an account of his succession: you who think largely
enough to forgive any man's deferring such notice to you, would
be the last man to defer giving it to any body else; and
therefore, to spare you any more of the compliments and thanks,
which surely I owe you, you shall let me go make my brother
happy.  Adieu!

(433) One of the pretenders to the throne of Persia, who gained
many victories about this time.

(434) When Mr. Walpole was at Florence he saw a fine picture by
Vasari of the Great duchess Bianca Capello, in the palace of
the Marchese Vitelli, whose family falling to decay, and their
effects being sold twelve years afterwards, Mr. Mann
recollected-Mr. Walpole's having admired that picture, bought
and sent it to him.

(435) Erasmus Shorter, brother of Catherine Lady Walpole, and
of Charlotte Lady Conway, whose surviving children, Edward and
Horace Walpole, Francis Earl of Hertford, Henry and Anne
Conway, became his heirs.



188 Letter 88
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Dec. 6, 1753.

I have at last found a moment to answer your letter; a
possession of which, I think, I have not been master these ten
days.  You must know I have an uncle dead; a sort of event that
could not possibly have been disagreeable to me, let his name
have been what it would; and to make it still less unpleasant,
here am I one of the heirs-at-law to a man worth thirty
thousand pounds.  One of the heirs, you must construe, one of
five.  In short, my uncle Erasmus is dead, and think at last we
may depend on his having made no will.  If a will should
appear, we are but where we were; if it does not, it is not
uncomfortable to have a little sum of money drop out of the
clouds, to which one has as much right as any body, for which
one has no obligation, and paid no flattery.  This death and
the circumstances have made extreme noise, but they are of an
extent impossible to tell you within the compass of any letter,
and I will not raise your curiosity when I cannot satisfy it
but by a narration, which I must reserve till I see you.

The only event I know besides within this atmosphere, is the
death of Lord Burlington, who, I have just heard, has left
every thing in his power to his relict.  I tell you nothing of
Jew bills and Jew motions, for I dare to say you have long been
as weary of the words as I am.  The only point that keeps up
any attention, is expectation of a mail from Ireland, from
whence we have heard, by a side wind, that the court have lost
a question by six; you may imagine one wants to know more of
this.

The opera is indifferent; the first man has a finer voice than
Monticelli, but knows not what to do with it.  Ancient Visconti
does so much with hers that it is intolerable.  There is a new
play of Glover's, in which Boadicea the heroine rants as much
as Visconti screams; but happily you hear no more of her after
the end of the third act, till in the last scene somebody
brings a card with her compliments, and she is very sorry she
cannot wait upon you, but she is dead.  Then there is a scene
between Lord Sussex and Lord Cathcart, two captives, which is
most incredibly absurd; but yet the parts are so well acted,
the dresses so fine, and two or three scenes pleasing enough,
that it is worth seeing.(436)

There are new young lords, fresh and fresh: two of them are
much in vogue; Lord Huntingdon and Lord Stormont.(437)  I
supped with them t'other night at Lady Caroline Petersham's;
the latter is most cried up; but he is more reserved, seems sly
and to have sense, but I should not think extreme: yet it is
not fair to judge on a silent man at first.  The other is very
lively and very agreeable.  This is the state of the town you
inquire after, and which you do inquire after as one does after
Mr. Somebody that one used to see at Mr. Such-a-one's formerly:
do you never intend to know more of us? or do you intend to
leave me to wither upon the hands of the town, like Charles
Stanhope and Mrs. Dunch? My contemporaries seem to be all
retiring to their proprerties.  If I must too, positively I
will go no farther than Strawberry Hill! You are very good to
lament our gold fish - their whole history consists in their
being stolen a deux reprises, the very week after I came to
town.

Mr. Bentley is where he was, and well, and now and then makes
me as happy as I can be, having lost him, with a charming
drawing. We don't talk of his abode; for the Hecate his wife
endeavours to discover it.  Adieu! my best compliments to Miss
Montagu.

(436) Glover's tragedy of "Boadicea" was acted nine or ten
nights at Drury Lane with some success; but was generally
considered better adapted to the closet than the stage.
Archbishop Herring, in a letter to Mr. Duncombe, gives the
following opinion of this play: "The first page of the play
Shocked me, and the sudden and heated answer of the Queen to
the Roman ambassador's gentle address is arrant madness.  It is
another objection, in my opinion, that Boadicea is really not
the object of crime and punishment, so much as pity; and,
notwithstanding the strong painting of her savageness, I cannot
help wishing she had got the better.  However, I admire the
play in many passages, and think the two last acts admirable,
In the fifth, particularly, I hardly ever found myself so
strongly touched."-E.

(437) David, Viscount Stormont, He was afterwards ambassador at
Vienna and Paris in 1779, one of the secretaries of state; and
in 1783, president of the council.  Upon the death of his
uncle, Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, in 1793, he succeeded to
the earldom.  He died in 1796.-E.



190 Letter 89
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, Dec. 19, 1753.

I little thought when I parted with you, my dear Sir, that your
absence(438) could indemnify me so well for itself; I still
less expected that I should find you improving daily: but your
letters grow more and more entertaining, your drawings more and
more picturesque; you write with more wit, and paint with more
melancholy, than ever any body did: your woody mountains hang
down "somewhat so poetical," as Mr. Ashe(439) said, that your
own poet Gray will scarce keep tune with you.  All this refers
to your cascade scene and your letter.  For the library it
cannot have the Strawberry imprimatur: the double arches and
double pinnacles are most ungraceful; and the doors below the
book-cases in Mr. Chute's design had a conventual look, which
yours totally wants.  For this time, we shall put your genius
in commission, and, like some other regents, execute our own
plan without minding our sovereign.  For the chimney, I do not
wonder you missed our instructions: we could not contrive to
understand them ourselves; and therefore, determining nothing
but to have the old picture stuck in a thicket of pinnacles, we
left it to you to find out the how.  I believe it will be a
little difficult; but as I suppose facere quia impossibile est,
is full as easy as credere, why--you must do it.

The present journal of the world and of me stands thus: King
George II does not go abroad--Some folks fear nephews,(440) as
much as others hate uncles.  The Castle of Dublin has carried
the Armagh election by one vote only--which is thought
equivalent to losing it by twenty.  Mr. Pelham has been very
ill, I thought of St.  Patrick's fire,(441) but it proved to be
St. Antony's.  Our House of Commons, mere poachers, are
piddling wit the torture of Leheup,(442) who extracted so much
money out of the lottery.

The robber of Po Yang(443) is discovered, and I hope will be
put to death, without my pity interfering, as it has done for
Mr. Shorter's servant,(444) or Lady Caroline Petersham's, as it
did for Maclean.  In short, it was a heron.  I like this better
than thieves, as I believe the gang will be more easily
destroyed, though not mentioned in the King's speech or
Fielding's treatises.

Lord Clarendon, Lord Thanet, and Lord Burlington are dead.  The
second sent for his tailor, and asked him if he could make him
a suit of mourning in eight hours: if he could, he would go
into mourning for his brother Burlington(445)--but that he did
not expect to live twelve hours himself.

There are two more volumes come out of Sir Charles Grandison.
I shall detain them till the last is published, and not think I
postpone much of your pleasure.  For my part, I stopped at the
fourth; I was so tired of sets of people getting together, and
saying, "Pray, Miss, with whom are you in love?" and of mighty
good young men that convert your Mr. M * * * *'s in the
twinkling of a sermon!--You have not been much more diverted, I
fear, with Hogarth's book(446)--'tis very silly!--Palmyra(447)
is come forth, and is a noble book; the prints finely engraved,
and an admirable dissertation before it.  My wonder is much
abated: the Palmyrene empire which I had figured, shrunk to a
small trading city with some magnificent public buildings out
of proportion to the dignity of the place.

The operas succeed pretty well;     and music has so much
recovered its power of charming that there is started up a
burletta at Covent Garden,(448) that has half the vogue of the
old Beggar's Opera: indeed there is a soubrette, called the
Niccolina, who, besides being pretty, has more vivacity and
variety of humour than ever existed in any creature.

(438) Mr. Bentley was now in the island of Jersey; whither he
had retired on account of the derangement of his affairs, and
whither all the following letters are addressed to him.

(439) A nurseryman at Twickenham.  He had served Pope.  Mr.
Walpole telling him he Would have his trees planted
irregularly, he said, "Yes, Sir, I understand: you would have
them hung down somewhat poetical."

(440) Frederick King of Prussia, nephew to George II.  Mr.
Walpole alludes to himself, who was upon bad terms with his
uncle Horace Walpole, afterwards Lord Walpole of Wolterton.

(441) Alluding to the disturbances and opposition to
government, which took place in Ireland during the viceroyalty
of Lionel Duke of Dorset.

(442) In framing the act for the purchase of the Sloane Museum
and the Harleian Manuscripts by lottery Mr. Pelham, who
disapproved of this financial expedient, as tending to foster a
spirit of gambling, had taken care to restrict the number of
tickets to be sold to any single individual.  Notwithstanding
which, Mr. Leheup, one of the commissioners of the lottery, had
sold to one person, under names which he knew to be fictitious,
between two and three hundred tickets.  The subject was brought
before the House of Commons, where a series of resolutions was
passed against Mr. Leheup, accompanied by an address to the
King, praying that the offender might be prosecuted.  The
result was, that he was prosecuted by the Attorney-general, and
fined one thousand pounds.-E.

(443) Mr. Walpole had given this Chinese name to a pond of gold
fish at Strawberry Hill.

(444) A Swiss servant of Erasmus Shorter's, maternal uncle to
Mr. Walpole, who was not without suspicion of having hastened
his master's death.

(445) The Countesses of Thanet and Burlington were sisters.

(446) The Analysis of Beauty.

(447) "The Ruins of Palmyra, otherwise Tadmor in the Desert,"
by Robert Wood, Esq.; a splendid volume in folio, with a number
of elegant engravings.  In 1757, Mr. Wood published a similar
description of the "Ruins of Balbec."-E.

(448) Harlequin Sorcerer.-E.



191 Letter 90
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 28, 1754.

Her Serene Highness, the great Duchess Bianca Capello,(449) is
arrived safe at a palace lately taken for her in Arlington
Street.  She has been much visited by the quality and gentry,
and pleases universally by the graces of her person and
comeliness of her deportment--my dear child, this is the least
that the newspapers would say of the charming Bianca. I, who
feel all the agreeableness of your manner, must say a great
deal more, or should say a great deal more, but I can only
commend the picture enough, not you.  The head is painted equal
to Titian; and though done, I suppose, after the 'clock had
struck five-and-thirty, yet she retains a great share of
beauty.  I have bespoken a frame for her, with the grand-ducal
coronet at top, her story on a label at bottom, which Gray is
to compose in Latin, as short and expressive as Tacitus, (one
is lucky when one can bespeak and have executed such an
inscription!) the Medici arms on one side, and the Capello's on
the other.  I must tell you a critical discovery of mine
apropos: in an old book of Venetian arms, there are two coats
of Capello, who from their name bear a hat; on one of them is
added a fleur-de-lis on a blue ball, which I am persuaded was
given to the family by the Great Duke, in consideration of this
alliance; the Medicis, you know, bore such a badge at the top
of their own arms.  This discovery I made by a talisman, which
Mr. Chute calls the Sortes Walpolianae, by which I find every
thing I want, `a pointe nomm`ee, whenever I dip for it.  This
discovery, indeed, is almost of that kind which I call
Serendipity, a very expressive word, which, as I have nothing
better to tell you, I shall endeavour to explain to you: you
will understand it better by the derivation than by the
definition.  I once read a silly fairy tale, called "The Three
Princes of Serendip;" as their Highnesses travelled, they were
always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things
which they were not in quest of: for instance, one of them
discovered that a mule blind of the right eye had travelled the
same road lately, because the grass was eaten only on the left
side, where it was worse than on the right--now do you
understand Serendipity? One of the most remarkable instances of
this accidental Sagacity, (for you must observe that no
discovery of a thing you are looking for comes under this
description,) was of my Lord Shaftsbury, who, happening to dine
at Lord Chancellor Clarendon's, found out the marriage of the
Duke of York and Mrs. Hyde, by the respect with which her
mother treated her at table.  I will send you the inscription
in my next letter; you see I endeavour to grace your present as
it deserves.

Your brother would have me say something of my opinion about
your idea of taking the name of Guise;(450) but he has written
so fully that I can only assure you in addition, that I am
stronger even than he is against it, and cannot allow of your
reasoning on families, because, however families may be
prejudiced about them, and however foreigners (I mean, great
foreigners) here may have those prejudices too, vet they never
operate here, where there is any one reason to counterbalance
them.  A minister who has the least disposition to promote a
creature of his, and to set aside a Talbot or a Nevil, will at
one breath puff away a genealogy that would reach from hence to
Herenhausen.  I know a great foreigner, who always says that my
Lord Denbigh is the best gentleman in England, because he is
descended from the old Counts of Hapsburg; and yet my Lord
Denbigh, (and though he is descended from what one should think
of much more consequence here, the old Counts of Denbigh,) has
for many years wanted a place or a pension, as much as if he
were only what I think the first Count of Hapsburg was, the
Emperor's butler.  Your instance of the Venetians refusing to
receive Valenti can have no weight: Venice might bully a Duke
of Mantua, but what would all her heralds signify against a
British envoy?  In short, what weight do you think family has
here, when the very last minister whom we have despatched is
Sir James Gray,--nay, and who has already been in a public
character at Venice!  His father was first a box-keeper, and
then footman to James the Second; and this is the man exchanged
against the Prince de San Severino!  One of my father's maxims
was quieta non movere; and he was a wise man in that his day.
My dear child, if you will suffer me to conclude with a pun,
content yourself with your Manhood and Tuscany: it would be
thought injustice to remove you from thence for any body else:
when once you shift about, you lose the benefit of
prescription, and subject yourself to a thousand accidents.  I
speak very seriously; I know the carte du pais.

We have no news: the flames in Ireland are stifled, I don't say
extinguished, by adjourning the Parliament, which is to be
prorogued.  A catalogue of dismissions was sent over thither,
but the Lord Lieutenant durst not venture to put them in
execution.  We are sending a strong squadron to the East
Indies, which may possibly bring back a war with France,
especially as we are going to ask money of our Parliament for
the equipment.  We abound in diversions, which flourish
exceedingly on the demise of politics.  There are no less than
five operas every week, three of which are burlettas; a very
bad company, except the Niccolina, who beats all the actors and
actresses I ever saw for vivacity and variety.  We had a good
set four years ago, which did not take at all; but these being
at the playhouse, and at play prices, the people, instead of
resenting it, as was expected, are transported with them, call
them their own operas, and I will not swear that they do not
take them for English operas.  They huzzaed the King twice the
other night, for bespeaking one on the night of the Haymarket
opera.

I am glad you are aware of Miss Pitt: pray continue your
awaredom: I assure you, before she set out for Italy, she was
qualified to go any Italian length of passion.  Her very first
slip was with her eldest brother: and it is not her fault that
she has not made still blacker trips.  Never mention this, and
forget it as soon as she is gone from Florence.  Adieu!

(449) Bianca Capello was the daughter of a noble Venetian.  She
had been seduced and carried off from her father's house by a
young Florentine of low origin, named Peter Bonaventuri.  They
came to Florence, where she became the mistress of the Grand
Duke of Tuscany, Francis of Medicis.  He was very anxious to
have a child by her; upon which she pretended to be brought to
bed of a son, who had in reality been bought of one of the
lower orders.  He was called Don Anthony of Medicis.  In order
to prevent the Grand Duke from discovering her fraud, Bianca
caused several of the persons who had had a part in the
deception to be assassinated.  At length the wife of Francis,
the Archduchess Joan of Austria, died in childbed; and Bianca
intrigued so successfully, that she persuaded her lover to
marry her.  Her marriage with the Grand Duke took place on the
12th of October, 1579, and was so sumptuous that it cost one
hundred thousand Florentine ducats.  Her tyranny and rapacity
soon made her universally hated.  She is supposed, as well as
her husband, to have died by poison, administered to them
through the means of his brother, the Cardinal Ferdinand of
Medicis, who succeeded him as Grand I)uke.-D.

(451) Mr. Mann's mother was an heiress of that house.



194 Letter 91
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, March 2, 1754.

After calling two or three times without finding him, I wrote
yesterday to Lord Granville,' and received a most gracious
answer, but desiring to see me.  I went.  He repeated all your
history with him, and mentioned your vivacity at parting;
however, consented to give you the apartment, with great good
humour, and said he would write to his bailiff; and added,
laughing, that he had an old cross housekeeper, who had
regularly quarrelled with all his grantees.  It is well that
some of your desires, though unfortunately the most trifling,
depend on me alone, as those at least are sure of being
executed.  By Tuesday's coach there will go to Southampton two
orange trees, two Arabian jasmines, some tuberose roots, and
plenty of cypress seeds, which last I send you in lieu of the
olive trees, none of which are yet come over.

The weather grows fine, and I have resumed little flights to
Strawberry.  I carried George Montagu thither, who was in
raptures, and screamed, and hooped and hollaed, and danced, and
crossed himself a thousand times over.  He returns to-morrow to
Greatworth, and I fear will give himself up entirely to country
squirehood.  But what will you say to greater honour which
Strawberry has received?  Nolkejumskoi(453) has been to see it,
and liked the windows and staircase.  I can't conceive how he
entered it.  I should have figured him like Gulliver cutting
down some of the largest oaks in Windsor Forest to make
joint-stools, in order to straddle over the battlements and
peep in at the windows of Lilliput.  I can't deny myself this
reflection (even though he liked Strawberry,) as he has not
employed you as an architect.

Still there is little news.  To-day it is said that Lord George
Sackville is summoned in haste from Ireland, where the grand
juries are going to petition for the resitting Of the
Parliament.  Hitherto they have done nothing but invent
satirical healths, which I believe gratify a taste more
peculiar to Ireland than politics, drinking.  We have had one
Considerable day in the House of Commons here.  Lord Egmont, in
a very long and fine speech, opposed a new Mutiny-bill for the
troops going to the East Indies (which I believe occasioned the
reports with you of an approaching war.)  Mr. Conway got
infinite reputation by a most charming speech in answer to him,
in which he displayed a system of military learning, which was
at once new, striking and entertaining.(454)  I had carried
Monsieur de Gisors thither, who began to take notes of all I
explained to him: but I begged he would not; for, the question
regarding French politics, I concluded the Speaker would never
have done storming at the Gaulls collecting intelligence in the
very senate-house.  Lord Holderness made a magnificent ball for
these foreigners last week: there were a hundred and forty
people, and most stayed supper.  Two of my Frenchmen learnt
country-dances, and succeeded very well.  T'other night they
danced minuets for the entertainment of the King at the
masquerade; and then he sent for Lady Coventry to dance: it was
quite like Herodias-and I believe if he had offered her a boon,
she would have chosen the head of St. John--I believe I told
you of her passion for the young Lord Bolingbroke.

Dr. Mead is dead, and his collection going to be sold.  I fear
I have not virtue enough to resist his miniatures.  I shall be
ruined!(455)

I shall tell you a new instance of the Sortes Walpolianae: I
lately bought an old volume of pamphlets; I found at the end a
history of the Dukes of Lorrain, and with that an account of a
series of their medals, of which, says the author, there are
but two sets in England.  It so happens that I bought a set
above ten years ago at Lord Oxford's sale; and on examination I
found the Duchess, wife of Duke Ren`e,(456) has a headdress,
allowing for being modernized, as the medals are modern, which
is evidently the same with that figure in my Marriage of Henry
VI. which I had imagined was of her.  It is said to be taken
from her tomb at Angiers; and that I might not decide too
quickly en connoisseur, I have sent to Angiers for a draught of
the tomb.

Poor Mr. Chute was here yesterday, the first going out after a
confinement of thirteen weeks; but he is pretty well.  We have
determined upon the plan for the library, which we find will
fall in exactly with the proportions of the room, with no
variations from the little door-case of St.  Paul's, but
widening the larger arches.  I believe I shall beg your
assistance again about the chimney-piece and ceiling; but I can
decide nothing till I have been again at Strawberry.  Adieu! my
dear Sir.

(452) John Earl Granville, then secretary of state, had an
estate in Jersey.

(453) The Duke of Cumberland.-E.

(454) Mr. Conway's speech will be found in the Parliamentary
History, vol. xv. p. 282.  The object of the bill was to extend
the operation of the Mutiny act to the troops in the service of
the East India Company.  This question was strongly combated,
on constitutional grounds, as conferring on a trading body
powers which ought to be viewed with jealousy, when vested even
in the head of the state.  The second reading was carried by
245 against 50.-E.

(455) Dr. Mead's pictures were chosen with so much judgment,
that at the sale of them in this month, they produced 3,417
pounds, 11 shillings, nearly seven hundred pounds more than he
gave for them.-E.

(456) Duke of Anjou, father of the unfortunate Margaret of
Anjou, Queen of Henry the Sixth of England.-E.



196 Letter 92
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, March 6, 1754.

My dear Sir,
You will be surprised at my writing again so very soon; but
unpleasant as it is to be the bearer of ill news,(457) I
flattered myself that you would endure it better from me, than
to be shocked with it from an indifferent hand, who would not
have the same management for your tenderness and delicacy as I
naturally shall, who always feel for you, and on this occasion
with you! You are very unfortunate: you have not many real
friends, and you lose--for I must tell it you, the chief of
them! indeed, the only one who could have been of real use to
you--for what can I do, but wish, and attempt, and miscarry?-
-or from whom could I have hoped assistance for you, or warmth
for myself and my friends, but from the friend I have this
morning lost?--But it is too selfish to be talking of our
losses, when Britain, Europe, the world, the King, Jack
Roberts,(458) Lord Barnard, have lost their guardian angel.
What are private misfortunes to the affliction of one's
country? or how inglorious is an Englishman to bewail himself,
when a true patriot should be acting for the good of mankind!-
-Indeed, if it is possible to feel any comfort, it is from
seeing how many true Englishmen, how many true Scotchmen are
zealous to replace the loss, and snatch at the rudder of the
state, amidst this storm and danger! Oh! my friend, how will
your heart glow with melancholy admiration, when I tell you,
that even the poor Duke of Newcastle himself conquers the
torrent of his grief, and has promised Mrs. Betty Spence,(459)
and Mr. Griham the apothecary, that, rather than abandon
England to its evil genius, he will even submit to be lord
treasurer himself? My Lord Chancellor, too, is said to be
willing to devote himself in the same manner for the good of
his country.  Lord Hartington(460) is the most inconsolable of
all; and when Mrs. Molly Bodens(461) and Mrs. Garrick were
entreated by some of the cabinet council to ask him whom he
wished to have minister, the only answer they could draw from
him was, "a Whig! a Whig!"  As for Lord B. I may truly say, he
is humbled and licks the dust; for his tongue, which never used
to hang below the waistband of his breeches, is now dropped
down to his shoe-buckles; and had not Mr. Stone assured him
that if the worst came to the worst, they could but make their
fortunes under another family, I don't know whether he would
not have despaired of the commonwealth.  But though I sincerely
pity so good a citizen, I cannot help feeling most for poor
Lord Holderness, who sees a scheme of glory dashed which would
have added new lustre to the British annals and have
transmitted the name D'Arcy down to latest posterity.  He had
but just taken Mr. Mason the poet into his house to write his
deserts; and he had just reason to expect that the secretary's
office would have gained a superiority over that of France and
Italy, which was unknown even to Walsingham.

I had written thus far, and perhaps should have elegized on for
a page or two further, when Harry, who has no idea of the
dignity of grief, blundered in, with satisfaction in his
countenance, and thrust two packets from you into my hand.-
-Alas! he little knew that I was incapable of tasting any
satisfaction but in the indulgence of my concern.--I was once
going to commit them to the devouring flames, lest any light or
vain sentence should tempt me to smile but my turn for true
philosophy checked my hand, and made me determine to prove that
I could at once launch into the bosom of pleasure and be
insensible to it.-I have conquered; I have read your letters,
and yet I think of nothing but Mr. Pelham's death! Could Lady
Catherine(462) do thus @ Could she receive a love-letter from
Mr. Brown, and yet think only on her breathless Lord?

Thursday,

I wrote the above last night, and have stayed as late as I
could this evening, that I might be able to tell you who the
person is in whom all the world is to discover the proper
qualities for replacing the national loss.  But, alas! the
experience of two @,whole days has showed that the misfortune
is irreparable; and I don't know whether the elegies on his
death will not be finished before there be any occasion for
congratulations to his successor.  The mystery is profound.
How shocking it will be if things should go on just as they
are! I mean by that, how mortifying if it is discovered, that
when all the world thought Mr. Pelham did and could alone
maintain the calm and carry on the government, even he was not
necessary, and that it was the calm and the government that
carried on themselves! However, this is not my opinion.--I
believe all this will make a party.(453)

Good night! here are two more new plays: Constantine,(464) the
better of them, expired the fourth night at Covent-garden.
Virginia,(465) by Garrick's acting and popularity, flourishes
still: he has written a remarkably good epilogue to it.  Lord
Bolingbroke is come forth in five pompous quartos, two and a
half new and most unorthodox.(466)  Warburton is resolved to
answer, and the bishops not to answer him.  I have not had a
moment to look into it.  Good night!

(457) This is an ironic letter on the death of Henry Pelham,
first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer,
with whom Mr. Walpole was on ill terms.

(458) John Roberts, Esq. secretary to Mr. Pelham.

(459) Companion to the Duchess of Newcastle. [This lady was
related to the Rev.  Joseph Spence, author of "Polymetis."  She
died in 1764, after being the friend and companion of the
Duchess of Newcastle for more than forty-five years.]

(460) William, afterwards fourth Duke of Devonshire.

(461) Companion of Lady Burlington, Lord Hartington's
mother-in-law.

(462) Lady Catherine Pelham, the widow of Mr. Pelham.-E.

(463) Mr. Walpole, when young, loved faction; and Mr. Bentley
one day saying, " that he believed certain opinions would make
a sect," Mr. W. said eagerly, "Will they make a party?"

(464) "Constantine," a tragedy was written by the Rev.  Philip
Francis, the translator of Horace and Demosthenes, and father
of Sir Philip Francis, the reputed author of the Letters of
Junius.  He also wrote "Eugenia," a tragedy; but as a dramatic
author he was not very successful.-E.

(465) "Virginia" was written by Henry Crisp, a clerk in the
Custom-house.  It was acted at Drury Lane with some success;
owing chiefly to the excellence of the performers.-E.

(466) A splendid edition of Lord Bolingbroke's Works, in five
volumes, quarto, having been published on the very day of Mr.
Pelham's death, Garrick wrote an ode on the occasion, which
contains the following stanza:-

"The same sad morn, to Church and State
(So for our sins 'twas fix'd by fate)
A double shock was given:
Black as the regions of the North,
St. John's fell genius issued forth,
And Pelham's fled to heaven!"

It was upon the appearance of this edition of Lord
Bolingbroke's works, edited by David Mallet, that Dr. Johnson
pronounced this memorable sentence upon both author and
editor:--"Sir, he was a scoundrel and a coward; a scoundrel,
for charging a blunderbuss against religion and morality; a
coward, because he had no resolution to fire it off himself,
but left half-a-crown to a beggarly Scotchman to draw the
trigger after his death."-E.



198 Letter 93
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 7, 1754.

You will little have expected, my dear Sir, the great event
that happened yesterday.  Mr. Pelham(467) is dead! all that
calm, that supineness, of which I have lately talked to you so
much, is at an end!  there is no heir to such luck as his.  The
whole people of England can never agree a second time upon the
same person for the residence of infallibility; and though so
many have found their interest in making Mr. Pelham the
fermier-general for their Venality, yet almost all have found
too, that it lowered their prices to have but one purchaser.
He could not have died at a more critical time: all the
elections were settled, all bargains made, and much money
advanced: and by the way, though there never was so little a
party, or so little to be made by a seat in Parliament, either
with regard to profit or fame, there never was such established
bribery, or so profuse.  And as every thing was settled by his
life, so every thing is thrown into confusion by his death: the
difficulty Of naming, or of who should name the successor, is
almost insurmountable--for you are not such a transmontane as
to imagine that the, person who must sign the warrant will have
the filling it up.  The three apparent candidates are Fox,
Pitt, and Murray; all three -with such encumbrances on their
hopes as make them very desperate.  The Chancellor hates Fox;
the Duke of Newcastle does not (I don't say, love him, but to
speak in the proper phrase, does not) pretend to love him: the
Scotch abominate him, and they and the Jacobites make use of
his connexion with the Duke to represent him as formidable: the
Princess cannot approve him for the same reason: the law, as in
duty bound to the Chancellor and to Murray, and to themselves,
whom he always attacks, must dislike him.  He has his parts and
the Whigs, and the seeming right of succession.  Pitt has no
health, no party, and has, what in this case is allowed to
operate, the King's negative.  Murray is a Scotchman, and it
has been suspected, of the worst dye: add a little of the
Chancellor's jealousy--all three are obnoxious to the
probability of the other two being disobliged by a preference.
There is no doubt but the Chancellor and the Duke of Newcastle
will endeavour to secure their own power, by giving an
exclusion to Fox: each of them has even been talked of for Lord
Treasurer; I say talked of, though Mr. Pelham died but
yesterday; but you can't imagine how much a million of people
can talk in a day on such a subject! It was even much imagined
yesterday, that Sir George Lee would be the Hulla, to wed the
post, till things are ripe for divorcing him again: he is an
unexceptionable man, sensible, of good character, the
ostensible favourite of the Princess, and obnoxious to no set
of men: for though he changed ridiculously quick on the
Prince's death, yet as every body changed with him, it offended
nobody; and what is a better reason for promoting him now, it
would offend nobody to turn him out again.

In this buzz is all the world at present: as the plot thickens
or opens, you shall hear more.  In the mean time you will not
dislike to know a little of the circumstances of this death.
Mr. Pelham was not sixty-one; his florid, healthy constitution
promised long life, and his uninterrupted good fortune as long
power; yet the one hastened his end, and the other was enjoyed
in its full tranquillity but three poor years!  i should not
say, enjoyed, for such was his peevishness and suspicions, that
the lightest trifles could poison all that stream of happiness!
he was careless of his health, most intemperate in eating, and
used no exercise.  All this had naturally thrown him into a
most scorbutic habit, for which last summer he went to
Scarborough, but stayed there only a month, which would not
have cleansed a scorbutic kitten.  The sea-air increased his
appetite, and his flatterers pampered it at their seats on the
road.  He returned more distempered, and fell into a succession
of boils, fevers, and St. Anthony's fire--indeed, I think, into
such a carbuncular state of blood as carried off my brother.
He had recovered enough to come to the House of Commons; and
last Friday walked in the Park till he put himself into an
immense sweat; in that sweat he stood at a window to look at
horses, ate immoderately at dinner, relapsed at six that
evening, and died yesterday morning (Wednesday) a quarter
before six.  His will was to be opened to-day; he is certainly
dead far from rich.(468) There arc great lamentations, some
joy, some disappointments, and much expectation.  As a person
who loves to write history, better than to act in it, you will
easily believe that I confine my sensations on the occasion
chiefly to observation-at least, my care that posterity may
know all about it prevents my indulging any immoderate (grief;
consequently I am as well as can be expected, and ever yours,
etc.

(467) Henry Pelham, chancellor of the exchequer, and first
commissioner of the treasury; only brother of Thomas Duke of
Newcastle.

(468) Walpole, almost the only author who has treated the
memory of Mr. Pelham with disrespect, mentions to his honour,
that he "lived without abusing his power, and died poor." See
Memoires, vol. i. p. 332.  By this expression, says Coxe, the
reader will be reminded of a curious coincidence in the
concluding lines of the eulogium inscribed on the base of Mr.
Pitt's statue, by his friend and pupil, the Right Honourable
George Canning, "Dispensing, for more than twenty years, the
favours of the crown, he lived without ostentation, and he died
poor."-E.



200 Letter 94
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, March 14, 1754.

In the confusion of things, I last week hazarded a free letter
to you by the common post.  The confusion is by no means
ceased. However, as some circumstances may have rendered a
desire of intelligence necessary, I send this by the coach,
with the last volume of Sir Charles Grandison, for its
chaperon.

After all the world has been named for chancellor of the
exchequer, and my Lord Chief Justice Lee, who is no part of the
world, really made so pro tempore; Lord Hartington went to
notify to Mr. Fox, that the cabinet council having given it as
their unanimous opinion to the King, that the Duke of Newcastle
should be at the head of the treasury, and he (Mr.  Fox)
secretary of state with the management of the House of Commons;
his grace, who had submitted to so oracular a sentence, hoped
Mr. Fox would not refuse to concur in so salutary a measure;
and assured him, that Though the Duke would reserve the sole
disposition of the secret service-money, his grace would bestow
his entire confidence on Mr. Fox, and acquaint him with the
most minute details of that service.  Mr. Fox bowed and obeyed-
-and, as a preliminary step, received the Chancellor's(469)
absolution.  From thence he attended his--and our new master.
But either grief for his brother's death, or joy for it, had so
intoxicated the new maitre du palais, that he would not ratify
any one of the conditions he had imposed: and though my Lord
Hartington's virtue interposed, and remonstrated on the purport
of the message he had carried, the Duke persisted in assuming
the whole and undivided power himself, and left Mr. Fox no
choice, but of obeying or disobeying, as he might choose.  This
produced the next day a letter from Mr. Fox, carried by Lord
Hartington, in which he refused secretary of state, and pinned
down the lie with which the new ministry is to commence.  It
was tried to be patched up at the Chancellor's on Friday night,
though ineffectually: and yesterday morning Mr. Fox in an
audience desired to remain secretary at war.  The Duke
immediately kissed hands-declared, in the most unusual manner,
universal minister.  Legge was to be chancellor of the
exchequer: but I can't tell whether that disposition will hold,
as Lord Duplin is proclaimed the acting favourite.  The German
Sir Thomas Robinson was thought on for the secretary's seals;
but has just sense enough to be unwilling to accept them under
so ridiculous an administration.  This is the first act of the
comedy.

On Friday this august remnant of the Pelhams went to court for
the first time.  At the foot of the stairs he cried and sunk
down: the yeomen of the guard were forced to drag him up under
the arms.  When the closet-door opened, he flung himself at his
length at the King's feet, sobbed, and cried "God bless your
Majesty! God preserve your Majesty," and lay there howling and
embracing the King's knees, with one foot so extended, that
Lord Coventry, who was luckily in waiting, and begged the
standers-by to retire with "For God's sake, gentlemen, don't
look at a great man in distress," endeavouring to shut the
door, caught his grace's foot, and made him roar out with pain.

You can have no notion of what points of ceremony have been
agitated about the ears of the family.  George Selwyn was told
that my Lady Catharine had not shed one tear: "And pray," said
he, "don't she intend it?"  It is settled that Mrs. Watson is
not to cry till she is brought-to-bed.

You love George Selwyn's bon-mots: this crisis has redoubled
them: here is one of his best.  My Lord Chancellor is to be
Earl of Clarendon--"Yes," said Selwyn, from the very summit of
the whites of his demure eyes; "and I suppose he will get the
title of Rochester for his son-in-law, my Lord Anson."  Do you
think he will ever lose the title of Lord Rochester?

I expected that we should have been overrun with elegies and
panegyrics: indeed, I comforted myself, that one word in all of
them would atone for the rest--the late Mr. Pelham.  But the
world seems to allow that their universal attachment and
submission was universal interestedness; there has not been
published a single encomium.  Orator Henley alone has held
forth in his praise:-yesterday it was on charming Lady
Catherine.  Don't you think it should have been in these words,
in his usual style?  Oratory-chapel,--Right reason; madness;
charming Lady Catherine; hell fire," etc.

Monday, March 18.

Almost as extraordinary news as our political, is, that it has
snowed ten days successively, and most part of each day: it is
living in Muscovy, amid ice and revolutions: I hope lodgings
will begin to let a little dear in Siberia!  Beckford and
Delaval, two celebrated partisans, met lately at Shaftesbury,
where they oppose one another: the latter said:

"Art thou the man whom men famed Beckford call?"

T'other replied,

"Art thou the much more famous Delaval?"

But to leave politics and change of ministries, and to come to
something of real consequence, I must apply you to my library
ceiling, of which I send you some rudiments.  I propose to have
it all painted by Clermont; the principal part in chiaro scuro,
on the design which you drew for the Paraclete: but as that
pattern would be surfeiting, so often repeated in an extension
of twenty feet by thirty, I propose to break and enliven it by
compartments in colours, according to the enclosed sketch,
which you must adjust and dimension.  Adieu!

'202 Letter 95
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, March 19, 1754.

You will live in the country, and then you are amazed that
people use you ill.  Don't mistake me: I don't mean that you
deserve to be ill-treated for living in the country; at least
only by those who love and miss you; but if you inhabited the
town a little, you would not quite so much expect uprightness,
nor be so surprised at ingratitude, and . neglect.  I am far
from disposed to justify the great C`u; but when you had
declined being his servant, do you wonder that he will not
serve your friends! I will tell you what, if the news of to-day
holds at all, which is what no one piece of news of this last
fortnight has done, you may be worse used by your cousin as
soon as you please; for he is one of the first upon the list
for secretary of state, in the room of the Duke of Newcastle.
Now again, are you such a rusticated animal as to suppose that
the Duke is dismissed for inability, on the death of his
brother.  So far from it, it is already certainly known that it
was he who supported Mr. Pelham, and the impediments and rubs
thrown in the way of' absolute power long ago were the effects
of the latter's timidity and irresolution.  The Duke, freed
from that clog, has declared himself sole minister, and the
King has kissed his hand upon it.  Mr. Fox, who was the only
man in England that objected to this plan, is to be sent to a
prison which is building on the coast of Sussex, after the
model of Fort l'Ev`eque, under the direction of Mr. Taaffe.

Harry Legge is to be chancellor of the exchequer, but the
declared favour rests on Lord Duplin.  Sir George Lyttelton is
to be treasurer of the navy.  The parliament is to be dissolved
on the fourth of next month: till when, I suppose, none of the
changes will take place.  These are the politics of the day;
but as they are a little fluctuating, notwithstanding the
steadiness of the new first minister, I will not answer that
they will hold true to Greatworth: nothing lasts now but the
bad weather.

I went two days ago, with Lady Ailesbury, and Mr. Conway, and
Miss Anne, to hear the rehearsal of Mrs. Clive's new farce,
which is very droll, with pretty music.



202 Letter 96
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 28, 1754.

I promised to write to you again soon, and therefore I do: that
Is, I stick to the letter, not to the essence; for I not Only
have very little to write, but your brother has, I believe,
already told you all that has happened.  Mr. Fox received
almost at once a testimonial that he was the most proper for
minister, and a proof that he was not to be so.  He on the
Tuesday consented to be secretary of state, with the management
of the House of Commons, and the very next day refused to be
the former, as he found he was not to have the latter.  He
remains secretary at war, in rupture with the Duke of
Newcastle, (who, you know, has taken the treasury,) but
declaring against opposition.  That Duke is omnipotent; and, to
show that power, makes use of nothing but machines.  Sir Thomas
Robinson is secretary of state; Mr. Legge, chancellor of the
exchequer; Lord Duplin,(470) the agent of business.(471)
Yesterday an odd event happened: Lord Gower resigned the privy
seal: it had been for some time promised to the Duke of
Rutland,(472) who having been reported dead, and who really
having voided a quarry of stones, is come to town; and his
brother, a Lord William Manners, better known in the
groom-porter's annals than in those of Europe, and the whole
Manners family having intimated to the Duke of Newcastle that
unless Lord Gower was dismissed in a month, and the Duke of
Rutland instated in his place, they would oppose the prosperous
dawn of the new ministry, that poor Earl, who is inarticulate
with the palsy, has been drawn into a resignation, and is the
first sacrifice to the spirit of the new administration.(473)
You will very likely not understand such politics as these, but
they are the best we have.

Our old good-humoured friend Prince Craon is dead; don't you
think that the Princess will not still despair of looking well
in weeds!  My Lord Orford's grandmother(474) is dead too; and
after her husband's death, (whose life, I believe, she has long
known to be not worth a farthing,) has left every thing to her
grandson.  This makes me very happy, for I had apprehended,
from Lord Orford's indolence and inattention, and from his
mother's cunning and attention, that she would have wriggled
herself into the best clause in the will; but she is not
mentioned in it, and the Houghton pictures may still be saved.
Adieu! my dear Sir; I don't call this a letter, but a codicil
to my last: one can't write volumes on trifling events.

204 Letter 97
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, April 24, 1754.

Before I received your letter of March 29th, I had already told
you the state of our politics, as they seemed fixed--at least
for the present.  The Duke of Newcastle is alone and all
powerful, and, I suppose, smiles at those who thought that we
must be governed by a succession of geniuses.  I don't know
whether there arc not more parts in governing without genius!-
-be it as it will, all the world acquiesces: he has placed all
the orators in whatever offices they demanded, and the New
Parliament, which is almost chosen, will not probably
degenerate from the complaisance of its predecessor.  Which of
the popes was it, who being chosen for his insufficience, said,
"I could not have believed that it was so easy to govern!"  You
will forgive my smiling in my turn at your begging me to lay
aside family considerations, and tell you if I do not think my
uncle the fittest subject for a first minister.  My dear child,
you have forgot that three years are past since I so totally
laid aside all family considerations, as not to speak or even
bow to my uncle.  Since the affair of Lord Orford and Miss
Nichol], I have not had the least intercourse with the
Pigwiggin branch; and should be very sorry if there were any
person in the world but you, and my uncle himself, who thought
him proper for minister.

I believe there is no manner of intention of sending Lord
Albemarle to Ireland: the style toward that island is extremely
lofty; and after some faint proposals of giving them some
agreeable governor, violent measures have been resumed: the
Speaker is removed from being chancellor of the exchequer, more
of his friends are displaced, and the Primate, with the
Chancellor and Lord Besborough, are again nominated lords
Justices.  These measures must oppress the Irish spirit, or,
what is more likely, inflame it to despair.  Lord Rochford
certainly returns to Turin.  General Wall, who was in the
highest favour here, and who was really grown fond of England-
-not at all to the prejudice of doing us what hurt he could in
his public character, is recalled, to succeed Don Carvalho and
Lancaster, as secretary of state for foreign affairs.  If he
regrets England too much, may not he think of taking Ireland in
his way back?

I shall fill up the remainder of an empty letter with
transcribing some sentences which have diverted me in a very
foolish vulgar book of travels, lately published by one
Drummond,(475) consul at Aleppo.  Speaking of Florence, he
says, that the very evening of his arrival, he was carried by
Lord Eglinton and some other English, whom he names, to your
house: "Mr. Mann" (these are his words) "is extremely Polite,
and I do him barely justice in saying he is a fine gentleman,
though indeed this is as much as can be said of any person
whatever; yet there are various ways of distinguishing the
qualities that compose this amiable character, and of these,
he, in my opinion, possesses the most agreeable.  He lives in a
fine palace; all the apartments on the ground-floor, which is
elegantly furnished, were lighted up; and the garden was a
little epitome of Vauxhall.  These conversationi resemble our
card-assemblies;" (this is called writing travels, to observe
that an assembly is like an assembly!) "and this was remarkably
brilliant, for all the married ladies of fashion in Florence
were present; yet were they as much inferior to the fair part
of a British assembly, especially those of York and Edinburgh,
as a crew of female Laplanders are to the fairest dames of
Florence.  Excuse this sally, which is more warm than just; for
even this assembly was not without a few lovely creatures.
Some played at cards, some passed the time in conversation;
others walked from place to place; and many retired with their
gallants into gloomy corners, where they entertained each
other, but in what manner I will not pretend to say; though, if
I may depend upon my information, which, by-the-by, was very
good, their taste and mine would not at all agree.  In a word,
these countries teem with more singularities than I choose to
mention."  You will conclude I had very little to say when I
had recourse to the observations of such a simpleton; but I
thought they would divert you for a moment, as they did me.
One don't dislike to know what even an Aleppo factor would
write of one-and I can't absolutely dislike him, as he was not
insensible to your agreeableness.  I don't believe Orpheus
would think even a bear ungenteel when it danced to his music.
Adieu!

parts of Asia, as far as the banks of the Euphrates."-.



205 Letter 98
To John Chute, Esq.
Arlington Street, April 30, 1754.

My God! Farinelli, what has this nation done to the King of
Spain, that the moment we have any thing dear and precious he
should tear it from us!-This is not the beginning of my letter
to you, nor does it allude to Mr. Bentley; much less is it
relative to the captivity of the ten tribes; nor does the King
signify Benhadad or Tiglath-pileser; nor Spain, Assyria, as Dr.
Pococke or Warburton, misled by dissimilitude of names, or by
the Septuagint, may, for very good reasons, imagine--but it is
literally the commencement of my lady Rich's(476) epistle to
Farinelli on the recall of General Wall, as she relates it
herself.  It serves extremely well for my own lamentation, when
I sit down by the waters of Strawberry, and think of ye, O
Chute and Bentley!

I have seen "Creusa,"(477) and more than agree with you: it is
the only new tragedy that I ever saw and really liked.  The
plot is most interesting, and, though so complicated quite
clear and natural.  The circumstance of so much distress being
brought on by characters, every one good, yet acting
consistently with their principles towards the misfortunes of
the drama, is quite new and pleasing.  Nothing offended me but
that lisping Miss Haughton, whose every speech is
inarticulately oracular.

I was last night at a little ball at Lady Anne Furnese's for
the new Lords, Dartmouth and North, but nothing passed worth
relating; indeed, the only event since you left London was the
tragicomedy that was acted last Saturday at the Opera.  One of
the dramatic guards fell flat on his face and motionless in an
apoplectic fit.  The Princess(478) and her children were there.
Miss Chudleigh, who apparemment had never seen a man fall on
his face before, went into the most theatric fit of kicking and
shrieking that ever was seen.  Several other women, who were
preparing their fits, were so distanced that she had the whole
house to herself; and, indeed such a confusion for half an hour
I never saw! The next day, at my Lady Townshend's, old Charles
Stanhope asked what these fits were called? Charles Townshend
replied, "The true convulsive fits, to be had only of the
maker." Adieu! my dear Sir.  To-day looks summerish, but we
have no rain yet.

not to succeed in the representation; yet it has seldom been
revived.-E.

]206 Letter 99
To John Chute, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 14, 1754.

My dear sir,
I wrote to you the last day of last month: I only mention it to
show you that I am- punctual to your desire.  It is my only
reason for writing to-day, for I have nothing new to tell you.
The town is empty, dusty, and disagreeable; the country is cold
and comfortless; consequently I daily run from one to t'other',
as if both were so charming that I did not know which to
prefer.  I am at present employed in no very lively manner, in
reading a treatise on commerce, which Count Perron has lent me,
of his own writing: this obliges me to go through with it,
though the subject and the style of the French would not engage
me much.  It does not want sense.

T'other night a description was given me of the most
extraordinary declaration of love that ever was made.  Have you
seen young Poniatowski?(479) he is very handsome.  You have
seen the figure of the Duchess of Gordon,(480) who looks like a
raw-boned Scotch metaphysician that has got a red face by
drinking water.  One day at the drawing-room, having never
spoken to him, she sent one of the foreign ministers to invite
Poniatowski to dinner with her for the next day.  He bowed and
went.  The moment the door opened, her two little sons, attired
like Cupids, with bows and arrows, shot at him; and one of them
literally hit his hair, and was very near putting his eye out,
and hindering his casting it to the couch

"Where she another sea-born Venus lay."

The only company besides this Highland goddess were two
Scotchmen, who could not speak a word of any language but their
own Erse; and to complete his astonishment at this allegorical
entertainment, with the dessert there entered a little horse,
and galloped round the table; a hieroglyphic I cannot solve.
Poniatowski accounts for this profusion of kindness by his
great-grandmother being a Gordon: but I believe it is to be
accounted for by * * * *  Adieu! my dear Sir.

(479) Stanislaus, the ill-fated King of Poland.

207 Letter 100
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 18, 1754.

My dear Sir,
Unless you will be exact in dating your letters, you will
occasion me much confusion.  Since the undated one which I
mentioned in my last, I have received another as unregistered,
with the fragment of the rock, telling me of one which had set
sail on the 18th, I suppose of last month, and been driven
back: this I conclude was the former undated.  Yesterday, I
received a longer, tipped with May 8th.  You must submit to
this lecture, and I hope will amend by it.  I cannot promise
that I shall correct myself much in the intention I had of
writing to you seldomer and shorter at this time of year.  If
you could be persuaded how insignificant I think all I do, how
little important it is even to myself, you would not wonder
that I have not much empressement to give the detail of it to
any body else.  Little excursions to Strawberry, little parties
to dine there, and many jaunts to hurry Bromwich, and the
carver, and Clermont, are my material occupations.  Think of
sending these 'cross the sea!-The times produce nothing.  there
is neither party, nor controversy, nor gallantry, nor fashion,
nor literature-the whole proceeds like farmers regulating
themselves, their business, their views, their diversions, by
the almanac.  Mr. Pelham's death has scarce produced a change;
the changes in Ireland, scarce a murmur.  Even in France the
squabbles of the parliament and clergy are under the same
opiate influence.--I don't believe that Mademoiselle Murphy
(who is delivered of a prince, and is lodged openly at
Versailles) and Madame Pompadour will mix the least grain of
ratsbane in one another's tea.  I, who love to ride in the
whirlwind, cannot record the yawns of such an age!

The little that I believe you would care to know relating to
the Strawberry annals, is, that the great tower is finished on
the outside, and the whole whitened, and has a charming effect,
especially as the verdure of this year is beyond what I have
ever seen it: the grove nearest the house comes on much; you
know I had almost despaired of its ever making a figure.  The
bow-window room over the supper-parlour is finished; hung with
a plain blue paper, with a chintz bed and chairs; my father and
mother over the chimney in the Gibbons frame, about which you
know we were in dispute what to do.  I have fixed on black and
gold, and it has a charming effect over your chimney with the
two dropping points, which is executed exactly; and the old
grate of Henry VIII. which you bought, is within it.  In each
panel around the room is a single picture; Gray's, Sir Charles
Williams's, and yours, in their black and gold frames; mine is
to match yours; and, on each side the doors, are the pictures
of Mr. Churchill and Lady Mary, with their son, on one side,
Mr. Conway and Lady Ailesbury on the other.  You can't imagine
how new and pretty this furniture is.-I believe I must get you
to send me an attestation under your hand that you knew nothing
of it, that Mr. Rigby may allow that at least this one room was
by my own direction. - AS the library and great parlour grow
finished, you shall have exact notice.

>From Mabland(481) I have little news to send you, but that the
obelisk is danced from the middle of the rabbit-warren into his
neighbour's garden, and he pays a ground-rent for looking at it
there.  His shrubs are hitherto unmolested, Et
MaryboniaCoS(482) gaudet revirescere lucos!

The town is as busy again as ever on the affair of Canning, who
has been tried for perjury.  The jury would have brought her in
guilty of perjury, but not wilful, till the judge informed them
that that would rather be an Irish verdict: they then brought
her in simply guilty, but recommended her.  In short, nothing
is discovered: the most general opinion is, that she was
robbed, but by some other gipsy.  For my own part, I am not at
all brought to believe her story, nor shall, till I hear that
living seven-and-twenty days without eating is among @ one of
those secrets for doing impossibilities, which I suppose will
be at last found out, and about the time that I am dead, even
some art of living for ever.

You was in pain for me, and indeed I was in pain for myself, on
the prospect of the sale of Dr. Mead's miniatures.  You may be
easy; it is more than I am quite; for it is come out that the
late Prince of Wales had bought them every one.

I have not yet had time to have your granite examined, but will
next week.  If you have not noticed to your sisters any present
of Ormer shells, I shall contradict myself, and accept them for
my Lady Lyttelton,(483) who is making a grotto.  As many as you
can send conveniently, and any thing for the same use, will be
very acceptable.  You will laugh when I tell you, that I am
employed to reconcile Sir George and Moore;(484) the latter has
been very flippant, say impertinent, on the former's giving a
little place to Bower, in preference to him.  Think of my being
the mediator!

The Parliament is to meet for a few days the end of this month,
to give perfection to the Regency-bill.  If the King dies
before the end of this month, the old Parliament revives, which
would make tolerable confusion, considering what sums have been
laid out on seats in this.  Adieu! This letter did not come
kindly; I reckon it rather extorted from me, and therefore hope
it will not amuse.  However, I am in tolerable charity with
you, and yours ever.

whimsical house and grounds at Twickenham.

209 Letter 101
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 21, 1754.

I did not intend to write to you till after Thursday, when all
your Boscawens, Rices, and Trevors(485) are to dine at
Strawberry Hill; but an event has happened, of which I cannot
delay giving you the instant pleasurable notice: now will you,
according to your custom, be guessing, and, according to your
custom, guessing wrong; but lest you should from my spirits
make any undutiful or disloyal conjectures for me, know, that
the great C`eu(486) of the Vine is dead, and that John the
first was yesterday proclaimed undoubted Monarch.  Nay,
champion Dimmock himself shall cut the throat of any Tracy,
Atkins, or Harrison, who shall dare to gainsay the legality of
his title.  In' short, there is no more will than was left by
the late Erasmus Shorter of particular memory.  I consulted
Madame Rice, and she advised my directing to you at Mrs.
Whettenhall's; to whom I beg as many compliments as if she
wrote herself "La blanche Whitnell."  As many to your sister
Harriot and to your brother, who I hear is with you.  I am
sure, though both you and I had reason to be peevish with the
poor tigress, that you grieve with me for her death.  I do most
sincerely, and for her Bessy: the man-tiger will be so sorry,
that I am sure he will marry again to comfort himself.  I am so
tired with letters I have written on this event, that I can
scarce hold the pen.  How we shall wish for you on Thursday-and
shan't you be proud to cock your tail at the Vine?  Adieu!

(485) The daughters of Mr. Montagu's uncle, John Morley Trevor,
of Glynd in Sussex; Anne, married to General Boscawen; Lucy,
married to Edward Rice, Esq.; and Miss Grace Trevor, who was
living at Bath in 1792.-E.

(486) Anthony Chute, Esq. of the Vine, Hants; who had been
member for Newport, Hants.-E.



210 Letter 102
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, May 23, 1754.

Pray continue your M`emoires of the war of the Delmontis;(487)
I have received two tomes, and am delighted with them.  The
French and Irish Parliaments proceed so heavily, that one
cannot expect to live to the setting up the first standard; and
it is so long since the world has furnished any brisk event,
that I am charmed with this little military entremets.  My Lady
Orford will certainly wish herself at Florence again on the
behalf of her old friend:(488) I always wish myself there; and,
according to custom, she and I should not be of the same party:
I cannot help wishing well to the rebellious.  You ask, whether
this Countess can deprive her son of her estate?-by no means,
but by another child, which, at her age, and after the variety
of experiments which she has made in all countries, I cannot
think very likely to happen.  I sometimes think her succession
not very distant: she is very asthmatic.  Her life is as
retired as ever, and passed entirely with her husband, who
seems a martyr to his former fame, and is a slave to her
jealousy.  She has given up nothing to him, and pays such
attention to her affairs, that she will soon be vastly rich.
But I won't be talking of her wealth, when the chief purpose of
my writing to-night is, to announce the unexpected riches and
good fortune of our dear Mr. Chute, I say our dear Mr. Chute,
for though you have not reason to be content with him, yet I
know your unchangeable heart-and I know he is so good, that if
you will take this occasion to write him a line of joy, I am
persuaded it will raccommode every thing; and though he will be
far from proving a regular correspondent, we shall all have
satisfaction in the re-establishment of the harmony.-In short,
that tartar his brother is dead: and having made no will, the
whole, and a very considerable whole, falls to our friend.
This good event happened but three days ago, and I wait with
the utmost impatience for his return from the Vine, where he
was at the critical instant.  As the whole was in the tyrant's
power, and as every art had been used to turn the vinegar of
his temper against his brother, I had for some time lived
persuaded that he would execute the worst purposes-but let us
forgive him!

I like to see in the Gazette that Goldsworthy(489) is going to
be removed far from Florence: his sting has long been out-and
yet I cannot help feeling glad that even the shadow of a
competitor is removed from you.

We are going to have a week of Parliament-not to taste the new
one, of which there is no doubt, but to give it essence: by the
Regency-bill, if the King had died before it had sat, the old
one must have revived.

There is nothing else in the shape of news but small-pox and
miliary fevers, which have carried off people you did not know.
If I had not been eager to notify Mr. Chute's prosperity to
you, I think I must have deferred writing for a week or two
longer: it is unpleasant to be inventing a letter to send so
far, and must be disappointing when it comes from so far, and
brings so little.  Adieu!

(487) This alludes to the proceedings of a mad prior of the
family of the Marchese Delmonti; who, with a party of ruffians,
had seized upon a strong castle called Monta di Santa Maria,
belonging to his brother the Marchese, and situated near
Cortona.  From whence he and his band ravaged the neighbouring
country; and it was only with great difficulty that the troops
of the Grand Duke of Tuscany succeeded in dislodging them-D.

(488) Marquis del Monti.

(489) Consul to Lisbon.



211 Letter 103
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 5, 1754.

Though I wrote to you but a few days ago, when I told you of
Mr. Chute's good fortune, I must send you a few lines to-night
upon a particular occasion.  Mr. Brand,(490) a very intimate
friend of mine, whom I believe you have formerly seen in Italy,
is just set out for Germany on his way to Rome.  I know by long
and uninterrupted experience, that my barely saying he is my
friend, will secure for him the kindest reception in the world
from you: it would not express my conviction, if I said a word
more on that head.  His story is very melancholy: about six or
seven years ago he married Lady Caroline Pierpoint,(491)
half-sister of Lady Mary Wortley;(492) a match quite of esteem,
she was rather older than he; but never were two people more
completely, more reasonably happy.  He is naturally all
cheerfulness and laughter; she was very reserved, but quite
sensible and faultless.  She died about this time twelvemonth
of a fever, and left him, with two little children, the most
unhappy man alive.  He travels again to dissipate his grief:
you will love him much, if he stays any time with you.  His
connexions are entirely with the Duke of Bedford.

I have had another letter from you to-day, with a farther
journal of the Delmonti war, which the rebels seem to be
leaving to the Pope to finish for them.  It diverted me
extremely.  had I received this letter before Mr. Brand set
out, I would have sent you the whole narrative of the affair of
Lord Orford and Miss -Nicholl; it is a little volume.  The
breach, though now by time silenced, was, I assure you, final.

We have had a spurt of Parliament for five days, but it was
prorogued to-day.  The next will be a terrible session from
elections and petitions.  The Oxfordshire(493) will be endless;
the Appleby outrageous in expense.  The former is a revival of
downright Whiggism and Jacobitism,, two liveries that have been
lately worn indiscriminately by all factions.  The latter is a
contest between two young Croesus's, Lord Thanet(494) and Sir
James Lowther:(495) that a convert; this an hereditary Whig.  A
knowing lawyer said, to-day, that with purchasing tenures,
votes, and carrying on the election and petition,
five-and-fifty thousand pounds will not pay the whole expense--
it makes one start!  Good night! you must excuse the
nothingness of a supernumerary letter.

(490) Thomas Brand, of the Hoo, in Hertfordshire.

(491) Daughter of Evelyn, Duke of Kingston, by his second wife.

(492) Lady Mary, in a letter to her daughter, of the 23d of
July, 1753, says, "The death of Lady Carolina naturally raises
the mortifying reflection, on how slender a thread hangs all
worldly prosperity! I cannot say I am otherwise much touched
with it.  It is true she was my sister, as it were, and in some
sense; but her behaviour to me never gave me any love, nor her
general conduct any esteem."-E.

(493) This was the great Oxfordshire contest between the
Jacobites and the Whigs.  The candidates of the former party
were Viscount Wenman and Sir Edward Turner, Bart.  those of the
latter, Viscount Parker, eldest son of the Earl of
Macclesfield, and Sir James Dashwood, Bart.  Great sums were
spent on both sides: in the election the Jacobites carried it;
but on petition to the House of Commons, the ministers, as
usual, seated their own friends.-D.

(494) Sackville Tufton, eighth Earl of Thanet.-D.

(495) Sir James Lowther had succeeded his collateral relation,
Henry, third Viscount Lonsdale, in his vast estates.  He became
afterwards remarkable for his eccentricities, and we fear, we
must add, for his tyranny and cruelty.  Mr. Pitt created him
Earl of Lonsdale, in the year 1784.  He died in 1802.-D.  [In
1782, he offered to build, and Completely furnish and man, a
ship of war of seventy guns for the service of the country at
his own expense; but the proposal, though sanctioned by the
King, was rendered unnecessary to be carried into execution by
the peace.]



212 Letter 104
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Saturday, June 8, 1754.

By my computation you are about returned to Greatworth: I was
so afraid of my letters missing you on the road, that I
deferred till now telling you how much pleasure I shall have in
seeing you and the Colonel at Strawberry.  I have long been
mortified that for these three years you have seen it only in
winter: it is now in the height of its greenth, blueth,
gloomth, honey-suckle and seringahood.  I have no engagement
till Wednesday se'nnight, when I am obliged to be in town on
law business.  You will have this to-morrow night; if I receive
a letter, which I beg you will direct to London, on Tuesday or
Wednesday, I will meet you here whatever day you will be so
good as to appoint.  I thank the Colonel a thousand times.  I
cannot write a word more; for I am getting into the chaise to
whisk to the Vine for two days, but shall be in town on Tuesday
night.  Adieu!



213 Letter 105
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, June 29, 1754.

I shall take care to send your letter the first time I write to
Mr. Bentley.  It is above a fortnight since I heard from him.
I am much disappointed at not having seen you yet; I love you
should execute your intentions while you intend them, because
you are a little apt to alter your mind, and as I have set mine
on your seeing Strawberry Hill this summer, while it is in its
beauty, you will really mortify me by changing your purpose.

It is in vain that you ask for news: I was in town two days
ago, but heard nothing; indeed there were not people enough to
cause or make news.  Lady Caroline Petersham had scraped
together a few foreigners, after her christening; but I cannot
say that the party was much livelier than if it had met at
Madame Montandre's.(496)  You must let me know a little
beforehand when you have fixed your time for coming, because,
as I am towards flying about on my summer expeditions, I should
be unhappy not to be here just when you would like it. Adieu!

P. S. I supped at White's the other night with the great C`u,
and he was by far more gracious, both on your topic and my own,
than ever I knew him.

(496) Widow of Francis de la Rochefaucauld, Marquis de
Montandre, who came to England with William the Third, and
served in all the wars of that monarch, and of Queen Anne.  He
was made a marshal in July 1739, and died in the following
August.-E.



213 Letter 106
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, July 5, 1754.

I believe you never receive a letter from me at this season of
the year, without wishing for winter, that I might have
something to tell you.  Warm weather in England disperses all
the world, except a few old folks, whose day of events is past,
and who contribute nothing to the society of news.  There is a
court indeed as near as Kensington, but where the monarch is
old, the courtiers are seldom young: they sun themselves in a
window like flies in autumn, past even buzzing, and to be swept
away in the first hurricane of a new reign.  However, as little
novelty as the season or the times produce, there is an
adventuress in the world, who even in the dullest times will
take care not to let conversation stagnate: this
public-spirited dame is no other than a Countess-dowager, my
sister-in-law, who has just notified to the town her intention
of parting from her second husband-a step which, being in
general not likely to occasion much surprise,-she had, however,
taken care to render extraordinary, by a course of inseparable
fondness and wonderful jealousy, for the three years since
these her second nuptials.  The testimonials which Mr. Shirley
had received in print from that living academy of love-lore, my
Lady Vane, added to this excessive tenderness of one, little
less a novice, convinced every body that he was a perfect hero.
You will pity poor Hercules!  Omphale, by a most unsentimental
precaution, has so secured to her own disposal her whole estate
and jointure, that he cannot command so much as a distaff; and
as she is not inclined to pay much for nothing, her offers on
the article of separation are exceedingly moderate.  As yet he
has not accepted them, but is gone to Scarborough, and she into
the west, to settle her affairs, and from thence embarks for
France and Italy.  I am sorry she will plague you again at
Florence; but I shall like to hear of what materials she
composes her second volume, and what reasons she will allege in
her new manifestoes: her mother, who sold her, is dead; the
all-powerful minister, who bought her, is dead! whom will she
charge with dragging her. to the bed of this second tyrant,
from whom she has been forced to fly--On her son's account, I
am really sorry for this second `equip`ee: I can't even help
pitying her! at her age nobody can take such steps, without
being sensible of their ridicule, and what snakes must such
passions be, as can hurry one over such reflections? Her
original story was certainly very unhappy; and the forcing so
very young a creature against her inclinations, unjustifiable:
but I much question whether any choice of her own could have
tied down her inclinations to -any temper--at least, I am sure
she had pitched upon a Hercules then, who of all men living was
the least proper to encounter such labours, my Lord
Chesterfield!

I have sent your letter to Mr. Chute, who is at his own Vine;
he had written to you of his own accord, and I trust your
friendship will be re-established as strongly as ever,
especially as there was no essential fault on either side, and
as you will now be prepared not to mind his aversion to
writing.  Thank Dr. Cocchi for the book(497) he is so good as
to intend for me; I value any thing from him, though I scarce
understand any thing less than Greek and physic; the little I
knew of the first I have almost forgot, and the other, thank
God! I never had any occasion to know.  I shall duly deliver
the other copies.

The French are encroaching extremely upon us in all the distant
parts of the world, especially in Virginia, from whence their
attempts occasion great uneasiness here.  For my own part, I
think we are very lucky, when they will be so good as to begin
with us at the farther end.  The revocation of the Parliament
of Paris, which is done or doing, is thought very bad for us: I
don't know but it may: in any other time I should have thought
not, as it is a concession or yielding from the throne, and
would naturally spirit up the Parliament to struggle on for
power; but no other age is a precedent for this.  As no
oppression would, I believe, have driven them into rebellion,
no concession will tempt them to be more assuming.  The King of
France will govern his Parliament by temporizing; the
Parliament of Ireland is governed by being treated like a
French one.  Adieu!

215 Letter 107
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Strawberry Hill, Saturday, July 6, 1754.

Your letter certainly stopped to drink somewhere by the way, I
suppose with the hearty hostess at the Windmill; for, though
written on Wednesday, it arrived here but this morning: it
could not have travelled more deliberately in the Speaker's
body-coach.  I am concerned, because, your fishmonger not being
arrived, I fear you have stayed for my answer.  The fish(498)
are apprised that they are to ride over to Park-place, and are
ready booted and spurred; and the moment their pad arrives,
they shall set forth.  I would accompany them on a pillion if I
were not waiting for Lady Mary,(499) who has desired to bring a
poor sick girl here for a few days to try the air.  You know
how courteous a knight I am to distressed virgins of five years
old, and that my castle-gates are always open to them.  You
will, I am sure, accept this excuse for some days: and as soon
as ever my hospitality is completed, I will be ready to obey
your summons, though you should send a water-pot for me.  I am
in no fear of not finding you in perfect verdure; for the sun,
I believe, is gone a great way off to some races or other,
where his horses are to run for the King's plate: we have not
heard of him in this neighbourhood.  Adieu!

(497) Gold fish.

(499) Lady Mary Churchill.



215 Letter 108
To Sir Richard Bentley, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 9, 1754.

I only write a letter for company to the enclosed one.  Mr.
Chute is returned from the Vine, and gives you a thousand
thanks for your letter; and if ever he writes, I don't doubt
but it will be to you.  Gray and he come hither to-morrow, and
I am promised Montagu and the Colonel(500) in about a
fortnight--How naturally my pen adds, but when does Mr. Bentley
come! I am sure Mr. Wicks wants to ask me the same question
every day--"Speak to it, Horatio!"  Sir Charles Williams
brought his eldest daughter hither last week: she is one of
your real admirers, and, without its being proposed to her,
went on the bowling-green, and drew a perspective view of the
castle from the angle, in a manner to deserve the thanks of the
Committee.(501)  She is to be married to my Lord Essex in a
Week,(502) and I begged she would make you overseer of the
works at Cashiobury.  Sir Charles told me, that on the Duke of
Bedford's wanting a Chinese house at Woburn, he said, "Why
don't your grace speak to mr. Walpole?  He has the prettiest
plan in the world for one."  --"Oh," replied the Duke, "but
then it would be too dear!" I hope this was a very great
economy, or I am sure ours would be very great extravagance:
only think of a plan for little Strawberry giving the alarm to
thirty thousand pounds a year! My dear sir, it is time to
retrench!  Pray send me 'a slice of granite(503) no bigger than
a Naples biscuit.

The monument to my mother is at last erected; it puts me in
mind of the manner of interring the Kings of France: when the
reigning one dies, the last before him is buried.  Will you
believe that I have not yet seen the tomb?  None of my
acquaintance were in town, and I literally had not courage to
venture alone among the Westminster-boys at the Abbey: they are
as formidable to me as the ship-carpenters at Portsmouth.  I
think I have showed you the inscription, and therefore I don't
send it yet].

I was reading t'other day the Life of Colonel Codrington,(504)
who founded the library at All Souls - he left a large estate
for the propagation of the Gospel, and ordered that three
hundred negroes should constantly be constantly employed upon
it.  Did one ever hear a more truly Christian charity, than
keeping a perpetuity of three hundred slaves to look after the
Gospel's estate?  How could one intend a religious legacy, and
miss the disposition of that estate for delivering three
hundred negroes from the most shocking slavery imaginable?
Must devotion be twisted into the unfeeling interests of trade?
I must revenge myself for the horror this fact has given me,
and tell you a story of Gideon.(505)  He breeds his children
Christians: he had a mind to know what proficience his son had
made in his new religion; "So," says he, "I began, and asked
him, who made him; He said 'God.'  I then asked him, who
redeemed him?  He replied very readily, 'Christ.'  Well, then I
was at the end of my interrogatories, and did not know what
other question to put to him.  I said, Who--who--I did not know
what to say; at last I said, Who gave you that hat?  'The Holy
Ghost,' said the boy."  Did you ever hear a better catechism?
The great cry against Nugent at Bristol was for having voted
for the Jew-bill: one old woman said, "What, must we be
represented by a Jew and an Irishman?" He replied with great
quickness, "My good dame, if you will step aside with me into a
corner, I will show you that I am not a Jew, and that I am an
Irishman."

The Princess(506) has breakfasted at the long Sir Thomas
Robinson's at Whitehall; my Lady Townshend will never forgive
it.  The second dowager of Somerset(507) is gone to know
whether all her letters from the living to the dead have been
received.  Before I bid you good-night, I must tell you of an
admirable curiosity: I was looking over one of our antiquarian
volumes, and in the description of Leeds is an account of Mr.
Thoresby's famous museum there-what do you think is one of the
rarities?--a knife taken from one of the Mohocks!  Whether
tradition is infallible or not, as you say, I think so
authentic a relic will make their history indisputable.
Castles, Chinese houses, tombs, negroes, Jews, Irishmen,
princesses, and Mohocks--what a farrago do I send you! I trust
that a letter from England to Jersey has an imposing air, and
that you don't presume to laugh at any thing that comes from
your mother island. Adieu!

217 Letter 109
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(508)
Strawberry Hill, August 6, 1754.

>From Sunday next, which is the eleventh, till the four or
five-and-twentieth, I am quite unengaged, and will wait upon
you any of the inclusive days, when your house is at leisure,
and you will summon me; therefore you have nothing to do but to
let me know your own time: or, if this period does not suit
you, I believe I shall be able to come to you any part of the
first fortnight in September; for, though I ought to go to
Hagley, it is incredible how I want resolution to tap such a
journey.

I wish you joy of escaping such an accident as breaking the
Duke's(509) leg; I hope he and you will be known to posterity
together by more dignified wounds than the kick of a horse.  As
I can never employ my time better than in being your
biographer, I beg you will take care that I may have no such
plebeian mishaps upon my hands or, if the Duke is to fall out
of battle, he has such delicious lions and tigers, which I saw
the day before yesterday at Windsor, that he will be
exceedingly to blame, if he does not give some of them an
exclusive patent for tearing him to pieces.

There is a beautiful tiger at my neighbour Mr. Crammond's here,
of which I am so fond, that my Lady Townshend says it is the
only thing I ever wanted to kiss.  As you know how strongly her
ladyship sympathizes with the Duke, she contrived to break the
tendon of her foot, the very day that his leg was in such
danger.  Adieu!

it is neither worth giving nor refusing.

218 Letter 110
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Aug 29, 1754.

You may be sure that I shall always be glad to see you whenever
you like to come hither, but I cannot help being sorry that you
are determined not to like the place, nor to let the Colonel
like it; a conclusion I may very justly make, when, I think,
for these four years, you have contrived to visit it only when
there is not a leaf upon the trees.  Villas are generally
designed for summer; you are the single person who think they
look best in winter.  You have still a more unlucky thought;
which Is, to visit the Vine in October.  When I saw it in the
middle of summer, it was excessively damp; you will find it a
little difficult to persuade me to accompany you thither On
stilts, and I believe Mr. Chute Will not be quite happy that
you prefer that season; but for this I cannot answer at
present, for he is at Mr. Morris's in Cornwall.  I shall expect
you and the Colonel here at the time you appoint.  I engage for
no farther, unless it is a very fine season indeed.  I beg my
compliments to Miss Montagu, and am yours ever.



218 Letter 111
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Oct. 6, 1754.

You have the kindest way in the world, my dear Sir, of
reproving my long silence, by accusing yourself.  I have looked
at my dates, and though I was conscious Of not having written
to you for a long time, I did not think it had been so long as
three months.  I ought to make some excuse, and the truth is
all I can make; if you have heard by any way in the world that
a single event worth mentioning has happened in England for
these three months, I will own myself guilty of abominable
neglect.  If there has not, as you know my unalterable
affection for you, you will excuse me, and accuse the times.
Can one repeat often, that every thing stagnates? At present we
begin to think that the world may be roused again, and that an
East Indian war and a West Indian war may beget such a thing as
an European war.  In short, the French have taken such cavalier
liberties with some of our forts, that are of great consequence
to cover Virginia, Carolina, and Georgia, that we are actually
despatching two regiments thither.  As the climate and other
American circumstances are against these poor men, I pity them,
and think them too many, if the French mean nothing farther;
too few, if they do. Indeed, I am one of those that feel less
resentment when we are attacked so far off: I think it an
obligation to be eaten the last.

You have entertained me much with the progress of the history
of the Delmontis, and obliged me.  I wish I could say I was not
shocked at the other part of your letter, where you mention the
re-establishment of the Inquisition at Florence.  Had Richcourt
power enough to be so infamous! was he superstitious, fearful,
revengeful, or proud of being a tool of the court of Rome?
What is the fate of the poor Florentines, who are reduced to
regret the Medicis, who had usurped their government! You may
be glad, my dear child, that I am not at Florence; I should
distress your ministerial prudence, your necessary prudence, by
taking pleasure to speak openly of Richcourt as he deserves:
you know my warmth upon power and church power!

The Boccaneri seems to be one of those ladies who refine so
much upon debauchery as to make even matrimony enter into their
scheme of profligacy.  I have known more than one instance,
since the days of the Signora Messalina, where the lady has not
been content to cuckold her husband but with another husband.
All passions carried to extremity embrace within their circle
even their opposites.  I don't know whether Charles the Fifth
did not resign the empire Out Of ambition of more fame.  I must
contradict myself in all passions; I don't believe Sir Robert
Brown will ever be so covetous as to find a pleasure in
squandering.

Mr. Chute is much yours: I am going with him in a day or two to
his Vine, where I shall try to draw him into amusing himself a
little with building and planting; hitherto he has done nothing
with his estate-but good.

You will have observed what precaution I had taken, in the
smallness of the sheet, not to have too much paper to fill; and
yet you see how much I have still upon my hands! As, I assure
you, were I to fill the remainder, all I should say would be
terribly wiredrawn, do excuse me: you shall hear an ample
detail of the first Admiral Vernon that springs out of our
American war; and I promise you at least half a brick of the
first sample that is sent over of any new Porto Bello.  The
French have tied up the hands of an
excellent fanfaron, a Major Washington,(511) whom they took,
and engaged not to serve for a year.  In his letter, he said,
"Believe me, as the cannon-balls flew over my head. they made a
most delightful sound."  When your relation, General Guise, was
marching up to Carthagena, and the pelicans whistled round him,
he said, "What would Chlo`e(512) give for some of these to make
a pelican pie?"  The conjecture made that scarce a rodomontade;
but what pity it is, that a man who can deal in hyperboles at
the mouth of a cannon, should be fond of them with a glass of
wine in his hand! I have heard Guise affirm, that the colliers
at Newcastle feed their children with fire-shovels! Good night.

(511) This was the celebrated Liberator of America, who had
been serving in the English army against the French for some
time with much distinction.

220 Letter 112
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(513)
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 24, 1754.

You have obliged me most extremely by telling me the progress
you have made in your most desirable affair.(514)  I call it
progress, for, notwithstanding the authority you have for
supposing there may be a compromise, I cannot believe that the
Duke of Newcastle would have affirmed the contrary so directly,
if he had known of it.  Mr. Brudenel very likely has been
promised my Lord Lincoln's interest, and then supposed he
should have the Duke's.  However, that is not your affair; if
any body has reason to apprehend a breach of promise, it is
poor Mr. Brudenel.  He can never come into competition with
you; and without saying any thing to reflect on him, I don't
know where you can ever have a competitor, and not have the
world on your side.  Though the tenure is precarious, I cannot
help liking the situation for you.  Any thing that sets you in
new lights, must be for your advantage.  You are naturally
indolent and humble, and are content with being perfect in
whatever you happen to be.  It is not flattering you to Say,
nor can you deny it, with all your modesty, that you have
always made yourself' master of whatever you have attempted,
and have never made yourself master of any thing without
shining extremely in it.  If the King lives, you will have his
favour; if he lives it all, the Prince must have a greater
establishment, and then you will have the King's partiality to
countenance your being removed to some distinguished place
about the Prince: if the King should fail, your situation in
his family, and your age, naturally recommend you to an equal
place in the new household.  I am the more desirous of seeing
you at court, because, when I consider the improbability of our
being in a situation to make war, I am earnest to have you have
other opportunities of being one of the first men in this
country, besides being a general.  Don't think all I say on
this subject compliment.  I can have no view in flattering you;
and You have a still better reason for believing me sincere,
which is, that you know well that I thought the same of you,
and professed the same to you, before I was of an age to have
either views or flattery; indeed, I believe you know me enough
to be sure that I am as void of both now as when I was
fourteen, and that I am so little apt to court any body, that
if you heard me say the same to any body but yourself, you
would easily think that I spoke what I thought.

George Montagu and his brother are here, and have kept me from
meeting you in town: we go on Saturday to the Vine.  I fear
there is too much truth in what you have heard of your old
mistress.(515)  When husband, wife, lover, and friend tell
every thing, can there but be a perpetual fracas? My dear
Harry, how lucky you was in what you escaped, and in what you
have got! People do sometimes avoid, not always, what is most
improper for them; but they do not afterwards always meet with
what they most deserve.  But how lucky you are in every thing!
and how ungrateful a man to Providence if you are not thankful
for so many blessings as it has given you! I won't preach,
though the dreadful history which I have just heard of poor
Lord Drumlanrig(516) is enough to send one to La Trappe.  My
compliments to all yours, and Adieu!

shot by the accidental discharge of his pistol on his journey
from Scotland to London, in company with his parents and newly-
married wife, a daughter of the Earl of Hopetoun.  Lady Mary
Wortley thus alludes to this calamity in a letter to her
daughter:--"The Duchess of Queensberry's misfortune would move
compassion in the hardest heart; yet, all circumstances coolly
considered, I think the young lady deserves most to be pitied,
being left in the terrible situation of a young and, I suppose,
rich widowhood; which is walking blindfold upon stilts amidst
precipices, though perhaps as little sensible of her danger, as
a child of a quarter old would be in the paws of a monkey
leaping on the tiles of a house."-E.



221 Letter 113
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Nov. 3, 1754.

I have finished all my parties, and am drawing towards a
conclusion here: the Parliament meets in ten days: the House, I
hear, will be extremely full--curiosity drawing as many to town
as party used to do.  The minister(517) in the house of Lords
is a new sight in these days.

Mr. Chute and I have been at Mr. Barret's(518) at Belhouse; I
never saw a place for which one did not wish, so totally void
of faults.  What he has done is in Gothic, and very true,
though not up to the perfection of the committee.  The hall is
pretty; the great dining room hung with good family pictures;
among which is his ancestor, the Lord Dacre who was
hanged.(519)  I remember when Mr. Barret was first initiated in
the College of Arms by the present Dean of Exeter(520) at
Cambridge, he was overjoyed at the first ancestor he put up,
who was one of the murderers of Thomas Becket.  The
chimney-pieces, except one little miscarriage into total Ionic
(he could not resist statuary and Siena marble), are all of a
good King James the First Gothic.  I saw the heronry so fatal
to Po Yang, and told him that I was persuaded they were
descended from Becket's assassin, and I hoped from my Lord
Dacre too.  He carried us to see the famous plantations and
buildings of the last Lord Petre.  They are the Brobdignag of
the bad taste.  The Unfinished house is execrable, massive, and
split through and through: it stands on the brow of a hill,
rather to seek for a prospect than to see one, and turns its
back upon an outrageous avenue which is closed with a screen of
tall trees, because he would not be at the expense of
beautifying the black front Of his house.  The clumps are
gigantic, and very ill placed.

George Montagu and the Colonel have at last been here, and have
screamed with approbation through the whole Cu-gamut.  Indeed,
the library is delightful.  They went to the Vine, and approved
as much.  Do you think we wished for you? I carried down
incense and mass-books, and we had most Catholic enjoyment Of
the chapel.  In the evenings, indeed, we did touch a card a
little to please George--so much, that truly I have scarce an
idea left that is not spotted with clubs, hearts, spades, and
diamonds.  There is a vote of the Strawberry committee for
great embellishments to the chapel, of which it will not be
long before you hear something.  It will not be longer than the
spring, I trust, before you see something of it.  In the mean
time, to rest your impatience, I have enclosed a scratch of
mine which you are to draw out better, and try if you can give
yourself a perfect idea of the place.  All I can say is, that
my sketch is at least more intelligible than Gray's was of
Stoke, from which you made so like a picture.

Thank you much for the box of Guernsey lilies, which I have
received.  I have been packing up a few seeds, which have
little merit but the merit they will have with you, that they
come from the Vine and Strawberry.  My chief employ in this
part of the world, except surveying my library which has scarce
any thing but the painting to finish, is planting at Mrs.
Clive's, whither I remove all my superabundancies.  I have
lately planted the green lane, that leads from her garden to
the common: "Well," said she, "when it is done, what shall we
call it?"-" Why," said I, " what would you call it but Drury
Lane?"  I mentioned desiring some samples of your Swiss's(521
abilities: Mr. Chute and I even propose, if he should be
tolerable, and would continue reasonable, to tempt him over
hither, and make him work upon your designs-upon which, you
know, it is not easy to make you work.  If he improves upon
your hands, do you think we shall purchase the fee-simple of
him for so many years, as Mr. Smith did of Canaletti?(522) We
will sell to the English.  Can he paint perspectives, and
cathedral-aisles, and holy glooms?  I am sure you could make
him paint delightful insides of the chapel at the Vine, and of
the library here.  I never come up the stairs without
reflecting how different it is from its primitive state, when
my Lady Townshend all the way she came up the stairs, cried
out, "Lord God! Jesus! what a house!  It is just such a house
as a parson's, where the children lie at the feet of the bed!"
I cant say that to-day it puts me much in mind of another
speech of my lady's, "That it would be a very pleasant place,
if Mrs. Clive's face did not rise upon it and make it so hot!"
The sun and Mrs. Clive seem gone for the winter.

The West Indian war has thrown me into a new study: I read
nothing but American voyages, and histories of plantations and
settlements.  Among all the Indian nations, I have contracted a
particular intimacy with the Ontaouanoucs, a people with whom I
beg you will be acquainted: they pique themselves upon speaking
the purest dialect.  How one should delight in the grammar and
dictionary of their Crusca! My only fear is, that if any of
them are taken prisoners, General Braddock is not a kind of man
to have proper attentions to so polite a people; I am even
apprehensive that he would damn them, and order them to be
scalped, in the very worst plantation-accent.  I don't know
whether you know that none of the people of that immense
continent have any labials: they tell you que c'est ridicule to
shut the lips in order to speak.  Indeed, I was as barbarous as
any polite nation in the world, in supposing that there was
nothing worth knowing among these charming savages.  They are
in particular great orators, with this little variation from
British eloquence, that at the end of every important paragraph
they make a present; whereas we expect to receive one.  They
begin all their answers with recapitulating what has been said
to them; and their method for this is, the respondent gives a
little stick to each of the bystanders, who is, for his share,
to remember such a paragraph of the speech that is to be
answered.  You will wonder that I should have given the
preference to the Ontaouanoucs, when there is a much more
extraordinary nation to the north of Canada, who have but one
leg, and p-- from behind their ear; but I own I had rather
converse for any time with people who speak like Mr. Pitt, than
with a nation of jugglers, who are only fit to go about the
country, under the direction of Taafe and Montagu.(523)  Their
existence I do not doubt; they are recorded by P`ere
Charlevoix, in his much admired history of New France, in which
there are such outrageous legends of miracles for the
propagation of the Gospel, that his fables in natural history
seem strict veracity.

Adieu! You write to me as seldom as if you were in an island
where the Duke of Newcastle was sole minister, parties at an
end, and where every thing had done happening.  Yours ever.

P. S. I have just seen in the advertisements that there are
arrived two new volumes of Madame de S`evign`e's Letters.
Adieu, my American studies!--adieu, even my favourite
Ontaouanoucs!

(519) Thomas ninth Lord Dacre.  Going, with other young
persons, one night from Herst Monceaux to steal a deer out of

in those days), a fray ensued, and one of the park-keepers
received a blow that caused his death; and although Lord Dacre
was not present on the spot, but in a distant part of the park,
he was nevertheless tried, convicted, and executed, in 1541.

224 Letter 114
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, November 11, 1754.

If you was dead, to be sure you would have got somebody to tell
me so.  If you was alive, to be sure in all this time you would
have told me so yourself.  It is a month to-day since I
received a line from you.  There was a Florentine ambassador
here in Oliver's reign, who with great circumspection wrote to
his court, "Some say the Protector is dead, others say he is
not: for my part, I believe neither one nor t'other."  I quote
this sage personage, to show you that I have a good precedent,
in case I had a mind to continue neutral upon the point of your
existence.  I can't resolve to believe you dead, lest I should
be forced to write to Mr. S. again to bemoan you; and on the
other hand, it is convenient to me to believe you living,
because I have just received the enclosed from your sister, and
the money from Ely.  However, if you are actually dead, be so
good as to order your executor to receive the money, and to
answer your sister's letter.  If you are not dead, I can tell
you who is, and at the same time whose death is to remain as
doubtful as yours till to-morrow morning Don't be alarmed! it
is only the Queen-dowager of Prussia.  As excessive as the
concern for her is at court, the whole royal family, out of
great consideration for the mercers, lacemen, etc. agreed not
to shed a tear for her till tomorrow morning, when the birthday
will be over; but they are all to rise by six o'clock to-morrow
morning to cry quarts.  This is the sum of all the news that I
learnt to-day on coming from Strawberry Hill, except that Lady
Betty Waldegrave was robbed t'other night In Hyde Park, under
the very noses of the lamps and the patrol.  If any body is
robbed at the ball at court to-night, you shall hear in my next
despatch.  I told you in my last that I had just got two new
volumes of Madame S`evign`e's Letters; but I have been cruelly
disappointed; they are two hundred letters which had been
omitted in the former editions, as having little or nothing
worth reading.  How provoking, that they would at last let one
see that she could write so many letters that were not worth
reading! I will tell you the truth: as they are certainly hers,
I am glad to see them, but I cannot bear that any body else
should.  Is not that true sentiment?  How would you like to see
a letter of hers, describing a wild young Irish lord, a Lord P
* * * *, who has lately made one of our ingenious wagers, to
ride I don't know how many thousand miles in an hour, from
Paris to Fontainebleau?  But admire the politesse of that
nation: instead of endeavouring to lame his horse, or to break
his neck, that he might lose the wager, his antagonist and the
spectators showed all the attention in the world to keep the
road clear, and to remove even pebbles out of his way.  They
heaped coals of fire upon his head with all the good breeding
of the Gospel.  Adieu! If my letters are short, at least my
notes are long.



225 Letter 115
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Nov. 16, 1754.

You are over-good to me, my dear Sir, in giving yourself the
trouble of telling me you was content with Strawberry Hill.  I
will not, however, tell you, that I am Content with your being
there, till you have seen it in all its greenth and blueth.
Alas! I am sorry I cannot insist upon as much with the Colonel.

Mr. Chute, I believe, was so pleased with the tenebra in his
own chapel, that he has fairly buried himself in it.  I have
not even had so much as a burial card from him since.

The town is as full as I believe you thought the room was at
your ball at Waldershare.  I hear of nothing but the parts and
merit of Lord North.  Nothing has happened yet, but sure so
many English people cannot be assembled long without committing
something extraordinary.

I have seen and conversed with our old friend Cope; I find him
grown very old; I fear he finds me so too; at least as old as I
ever intend to be.  I find him very grave too, which I believe
he does not find me.

Solomon and Hesther, as my Lady Townshend calls Mr. Pitt and
Lady Hester Grenville, espouse one another to-day.(524)  I know
nothing more but a new fashion which my Lady Hervey has brought
from Paris.  It is a tin funnel covered with green ribbon, and
holds water, which the ladies wear to keep their bouquets
fresh.  I fear Lady Caroline and some others will catch
frequent colds and sore throats with overturning this
reservoir.

Apropos, there is a match certainly in agitation, which has
very little of either Solomon or Hesther in it.  You will be
sorry when I tell you, that Lord Waldegrave certainly
dis-Solomons himself with the Drax.  Adieu! my dear Sir; I
congratulate Miss Montagu on her good health, and am ever
yours.

(524) On the ]6th of November, Mr. Pitt married Lady Hester
Grenville, only daughter of Richard Grenville, of Wotton, Esq.,
and of Hester, Countess Temple.-E.



226 Letter 116
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, Nov. 20, 1754.

IF this does not turn out a scolding letter I am much mistaken.
I shall give way to it with the less scruple, as I think it
shall be the last of the kind; not that you will mend, but I
cannot support a commerce of visions! and therefore, whenever
you send me mighty cheap schemes for finding out longitudes and
philosophers' stones, you will excuse me if I only smile, and
don't order them to be examined by my council.  For Heaven's
sake, don't be a projector!  Is not it provoking, that, with
the best parts in the world, you should have so gentle a
portion of common sense?(525)  But I am clear, that you never
will know the two things in the world that import you the most
to know, yourself and me.  Thus much by way of preface: now for
the detail.

You tell me in your letter of November 3d, that the (quarry of
granite might be rented at twenty pounds or twenty shillings, I
don't know which, no matter, per annum.  When I can't get a
table out of it, is it very likely you or I should get a
fortune out of it?  What signifies the cheapness of the rent?
The cutting and shippage would be articles of some little
consequence!  Who should be supervisor?  You, who are so good a
manager, so attentive, so diligent, so expeditious, and so
accurate? Don't you think our quarry would turn to account?
Another article, to which I might apply the same questions, is
the project for importation of French wine: it is odd that a
scheme so cheap and so practicable should hitherto have been
totally overlooked.  One would think the breed of smugglers was
lost, like the true spaniels, or genuine golden pippins! My
dear Sir, you know I never drink three glasses of my wine-can
you think I care whether, they are sour or sweet, cheap or
dear?--or do you think that I, who am always taking trouble to
reduce my trouble into as compact a volume as I can, would tap
such an article as importing my own wine?  But now comes your
last proposal about the Gothic paper.  When you made me fix up
mine, unpainted, engaging to paint it yourself, and yet could
never be persuaded to paint a yard of it, till I was forced to
give Bromwich's man God knows what to do it.  would you make me
believe that you will paint a room eighteen by fifteen?  But,
seriously, if it is possible for you to lay aside visions,
don't be throwing continual discouragements in my way.  I have
told you seriously and emphatically that I am labouring your
restoration: the scheme is neither facile nor immediate:-but,
for God's sake! act like a reasonable man.  You have a family
to whom you owe serious attention.  Don't let me think, that if
you return, you will set out upon every wildgoose chase,
sticking to nothing, and neglecting chiefly the talents and
genius which you have in such excellence, to start projects
which you have too much honesty and too little application ever
to thrive by.  This advice is, perhaps, worded harshly: but you
know the heart from which it proceeds, and you know that, with
all my prejudice to it, I can't even pardon your wit, when it
is employed to dress up schemes that I think romantic.  The
glasses and Ray's Proverbs you shall have, and some more gold
fish, when I have leisure to go to Strawberry; for you know I
don't suffer any fisheries to be carried on there in my
absence.

I am as newsless as in the dead of summer: the Parliament
produces nothing but elections: there has already been one
division- on the Oxfordshire of two hundred and sixty-seven
Whigs to ninety-seven Tories: you may calculate the burial of
that election easily from these numbers.(526)  The Queen of
Prussia is not dead, as I told you in my last.  If you have
shed many tears for her, you may set them off to the account of
our son-in-law, the Prince of Hesse, who is turned Roman
Catholic.  One is in this age so unused to conversions above
the rank of a housemaid turned Methodist, that it occasions as
much surprise as if one had heard that he had been initiated in
the Eleusinian mysteries.  Are not you prodigiously alarmed for
the Protestant interest in Germany?

We have operas, burlettas, cargoes of Italian dancers, and none
good but the Mingotti, a very fine figure and actress.  I don't
know a single bon-mot that is new: George Selwyn has not waked
yet for the winter.  You will believe that, when I tell you,
that t'other night having lost eight hundred pounds at hazard,
he fell asleep upon the table with near half as much more
before him, and slept for three hours, with every body stamping
the box close at his ear.  He will say prodigiously good things
when he does wake.  In the mean time, can you be content with
one of Madame S`evign`e's best bons-mots, which I have found
amongst her new letters? Do you remember her German friend the
Princess of Tarente, who was always in mourning for some
sovereign prince or princess? One day Madame de S`evign`e
happening to meet her in colours, made her a low curtsey, and
said, "Madame, je me r`ejouis de la sant`e de l'Europe." I
think I may apply another of her speeches which pleased me, to
what I have said t@ you in the former part of my letter.
Mademoiselle du Plessis had said something she disapproved:
Madame S`evign`e said to her, "Mais que cela est sot; car je
veux vous parler doucement."  Adieu!

(525) Cumberland, in his Memoirs, speaking of Mr. Bentley,
says, "There was a certain eccentricity and want of worldly
prudence in my uncle's character, that involved him in
distresses, and reduced him to situations uncongenial with his
feelings, and unpropitious to the cultivation and encouragement
of his talents."-E.

(526) At the close of the Oxfordshire election the sheriff
returned all the four candidates, who all of them petitioned.
Two were chosen upon what was called the new interest, and were
supported by the court; and two by the old interest.  The
expense and animosity which this dispute occasioned is
incredible.  Even murder was committed upon the place of
elections The friends of the new interest were ultimately voted
to be the sitting members by a majority of 233 against 103.-E.



228 Letter 117
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Dec. 1, 1754

You do me justice, my dear Sir,
when you impute the want of my letters to my want of news: as a
proof, I take up my pen again on the first spring-tide of
politics.  However, as this is an age of abortions, and as I
have often announced to you a pregnancy of events, which have
soon after been stillborn, I beg you will not be disappointed
if nothing comes of the present ferment.  The offenders and the
offended have too often shown their disposition to soothe, or
to be soothed, by preferments, for one to build much on the
duration or implacability of their aversions.  In short, Mr.
Pitt has broke with the Duke of Newcastle, on the want of
power, and has alarmed the dozing House of Commons with some
sentences, extremely in the style of his former Pittics.  As
Mr. Fox is not at all more in humour, the world expects every
day to see these two commanders, first unite to overturn all
their antagonists, and then worry One another.  They have
already mumbled poor Sir Thomas Robinson cruelly.  The
Chancellor of the exchequer(527) crouches under the storm, and
seems very willing to pass eldest.  The Attorney-General(528)
seems cowed, and unwilling to support a war, of which the world
gives him the honour.(529)  Nugent alone, with an intrepidity
worth his country, affects to stand up against the greatest
orator, and against the best reasoner of the age.  What will
most surprise you is, that the Duke of Newcastle, who used to
tremble at shadows, appears unterrified at Gorgons!  If I
should tell you in my next, that either of the Gorgons has
kissed hands for secretary of state, only smile: snakes are as
easily tamed as lapdogs.

I am glad you have got my Lord of Cork.(530)  He is, I know, a
very worthy man, and though not a bright man, nor a man of the
world, much less a good author, yet it must be comfortable to
you now and then to see something besides travelling children,
booby governors, and abandoned women of quality.  You say, you
have made my Lord Cork give up my Lord Bolingbroke: it is
comical to see how he is given up here, since the best of his
writings, his metaphysical divinity, have been published.
While he betrayed and abused every man who trusted him, or who
had forgiven him, or to whom he was obliged, he was a hero, a
patriot, and a philosopher; and the greatest genius of the age:
the moment his Craftsmen against Moses and St. Paul, etc. were
published, we have discovered that he was the worst man and the
worst writer in the world.  The grand jury have presented his
works, and as long as there are any parsons, he will be ranked
with Tindal and Toland--nay, I don't know whether my father
won't become a rubric martyr, for having been persecuted by
him.  Mr. Fraigneau's story of the late King's design of
removing my father and employing, Bolingbroke, is not new to
me; but I can give you two reasons, and one very strong indeed,
that convince me of its having no foundation, though it is much
believed here.  During the last year of the late King's life,
he took extremely to New Park, and loved to shoot there, and
dined with my father and a private party, and a good deal of
punch.  The Duchess of Kendal, who hated Sir Robert, and
favoured Bolingbroke, and was jealous for herself, grew uneasy
at these parties, and used to put one or two of the Germans
upon the King to prevent his drinking, (very odd preventives!)-
-however, they obeyed orders so well, that one day the King
flew into a great passion, and reprimanded them in his own
language with extreme warmth; and when he went to Hanover,
ordered my father to have the new lodge in the park finished
against his return; which did not look much like an intention
of breaking with the ranger of the Park.  But what I am now
going to tell you is conclusive: the Duchess obtained an
interview for Bolingbroke in the King's closet, which not
succeeding, as lord Bolingbroke foresaw it might not at once,
he left a memorial with the King, who, the very next time he
saw Sir Robert, gave it to him.

You will expect that I should mention the progress of the West
Indian war; but the Parliamentary campaign opening so warmly,
has quite put the Ohio upon an obsolete foot.  All I know is,
that the Virginians have disbanded all their troops and say
they will trust to England for their defence.  The dissensions
in Ireland increase.  At least, here are various and ample
fields for speeches, if we are to have new oppositions.  You
will believe that I have not great faith in the prospect, when
I can come quietly hither for two or three days to place the
books in my new library.  Mr. Chute is with me, and returns you
all your kind speeches with increase.  Your two brothers, who
dine at lord Radnor's, have just been here, and found me
writing to you: your brother Gal. would not stay a moment, but
said, , Tell him I prefer his pleasure to my own." I wish, my
dear Sir, I could give you much more, that is, could tell you
more; but unless our civil wars continue, I shall know nothing
but of contested elections: a first session of a Parliament is
the most laborious scene of dulness that I know.  Adieu!

Pitt in a kind of parliamentary opposition.  They were both in
office,--the one paymaster, the other secretary at war,-and
therefore could not decently obstruct the public business; but
still they might attack persons, though not things.  Pitt
undertook the difficult task of silencing Murray, the
attorney-general, the ablest man, as well as the ablest
debater, in the House of Commons; whilst Fox entertained
himself with the less dangerous amusement of exposing Sir
Thomas Robinson, or rather assisted him whilst he turned
himself into ridicule; for Sir Thomas, though a good secretary
of state -is far as the business of his office, was ignorant
even of the language of the House of Commons controversy; and
when he played the orator, it was so exceedingly ridiculous,
that those who loved and esteemcd him could not always preserve
a friendly composure of countenance." Memoirs, 1). 31.-E.

230 Letter 118
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, Friday, Dec. 13, 1754.

"If we do not make this effort to recover our dignity, we shall
only sit here to register the arbitrary edicts of one too
powerful a subject."  Non riconosci tu Faltero viso?  Don't you
at once know the style?  Shake those words all altogether-, and
see if they can be any thing but the disiecta membra of Pitt?
In short, about a fortnight ago, bomb burst.  Pitt, who is
well, is married, is dissatisfied--not With his bride, but with
the Duke of Newcastle; has twice thundered out his
dissatisfaction in Parliament, and was seconded by Fox.  The
event was exactly what I dare say you have already foreseen.
Pitt was to be turned out; overtures were made to Fox; Pitt is
not turned out: Fox is quieted with the dignity of
cabinet-counsellor, and the Duke of Newcastle remains
affronted--and omnipotent.  The commentary on this text is too
long for a letter; it may be developed some time or other.
This scene has produced a diverting interlude; Sir George
Lyttelton, who could not reconcile his content with Mr. Pitt's
discontents, has been very ill with the cousinhood.  In the
grief of his heart, he thought of resigning his place, but
somehow or other stumbled upon a negotiation for introducing
the Duke of Bedford into the ministry again, to balance the
loss of Mr. Pitt.  Whatever persuaded him, he thought this
treaty so sure of success that he lost no time to be the agent
of it himself; and whether commissioned or noncommissioned, as
both he and the Duke of Newcastle say, he carried carte
blanche, to the Duke of Bedford, who bounced like a rocket,
frightened away poor Sir George, and sent for Mr. Pitt to
notify the overture.  Pitt and the Grenvilles are outrageous;
the Duke of Newcastle disclaims his ambassador, and every body
laughs.  Sir George came hither yesterday, to expectorate with
me, as he called it.  Think how I pricked up my ears, as high
as King Midas, to hear a Lyttelton vent his grievances against
a Pitt and Grenvilles! Lord Temple has named Sir George the
apostolic nuncio; and George Selwyn says, "that he will
certainly be invited by Miss Ashe among the foreign ministers."
These are greater storms than perhaps you expected yet; they
have occasioned mighty bustle, and whisper, and speculation;
but you see

Pulveris exigui jactu composta quiescunt.

You will be diverted with a collateral incident.  * * * * met
Dick Edgecumbe, and asked him with great importance, if he knew
whether Mr. Pitt was out.  Edgecumbe, who thinks nothing
important that is not to be decided by dice, and who,
consequently, had never once thought of Pitt's political state,
replied, "Yes."  "Ay! how do you know?"  "Why, I called at his
door just now, and his porter told me so."  Another political
event is, that Lord E. comes into place: he is to succeed Lord
Fitzwalter, who is to have Lord Grantham's pension, -who is
dead immensely rich: I think this is the last of the old
Opposition, of any name, except Sir John Barnard.  If you have
curiosity about the Ohio, you must write to ]France: there I
believe they know something about it; here it was totally
forgot till last night, when an express arrived with an account
of the loss of one    of the transports off Falmouth, with
eight officers and sixty men on board.

My Lady Townshend has been dying, and was wofully frightened,
and took prayers; but she is recovered now, even of her
repentance.  You will not be undiverted to hear that the mob of
Sudbury have literally sent a card to the mob of Bury, to offer
their assistance at a contested election there: I hope to be
able to tell you in my next, that Mrs. Holman(531) has sent
cards to both mobs for her assembly.

The shrubs shall be sent, but you must stay till the holidays;
I shall not have time to go to Strawberry sooner.  I have
received your second letter, dated November 22d, about the
Gothic paper.  I hope you will by this time have got mine, to
dissuade you from that thought.  If you insist upon it, I will
send the paper: I have told you what I think, and will
therefore say no more on that head; but I will transcribe a
passage which I found t'other day in Petronius, and thought not
unapplicable to you: "Omnium herbarum succos Democritus
expressit; et ne lapidum virgultorumque vis lateret, aetatem
inter experimenta consumpsit."  I hope Democritus could not
draw charmingly when he threw away his time in extracting tints
from flints and twigs!

I can't conclude my letter without telling you what an escape I
had at the sale of Dr. Mead's library, which goes extremely
dear.  In the catalogue I saw Winstanley's views of Audley-inn,
which I concluded was, as it really was, a thin, dirty folio,
worth about fifteen shillings.  As I thought it might be
scarce, it might run to two or three guineas.  however, I bid
Graham certainly buy it for me.  He came the next morning in a
great fright, said he did not know whether he had done very
right or very wrong, that he had gone as far as nine-and-forty
guineas--I started in such a fright! Another bookseller had
luckily had as unlimited a commission, and bid fifty--when my
Graham begged it might be adjourned, till they could consult
their principals.  I think I shall never give an unbounded
commission again, even for views of Les Rochers!(532)  Adieu!
Am I ever to see any more of your hand-drawing? Adieu!  Yours
ever.

231 Letter 119
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Dec. 24, 1754.                            '

My dear Sir,
I received your packet of December 6th last night, but
intending to come hither for a few days, and unluckily sent
away by the coach in the morning a parcel of things for you;
you must therefore wait till another bundle sets out, for the
new letters of Madame S`evign`e.  Heaven forbid that I should
have said they were bad! I only meant that they were full of
family details, and mortal distempers, to which the most
immortal of us are subject: and I was sorry that the profane
should ever know that my divinity was ever troubled with a sore
leg, or the want of money; though, indeed, the latter defeats
Bussy@s ill natured accusation of avarice; and her tearing
herself from her daughter, then at Paris, to go and save money
in Bretagne to pay her debts, is a perfection of virtue which
completes her amiable character.  My lady Hervey has made me
most happy, by bringing me from Paris an admirable copy of the
very portrait that was Madame de Simiane's: I am going to build
an altar for it, under the title of Notre Dame des Rochers!

Well! but you will want to know the contents of the parcel that
is set out.  It Contains another parcel, which contains I don't
know what; but Mr. Cumberland sent it, and desired I would
transmit it to you.  There arc Ray's Proverbs, in two volumes
interleaved; a few seeds, mislaid when I sent the last; a very
indifferent new tragedy, called "Barbarossa,"(533) now running;
the author(534) unknown, but believed to be Garrick himself.
There is not one word of Barbarossa's real story, but almost
the individual history of Merope; not one new thought, and,
which is the next material want, but one line of perfect
nonsense;

"And rain down transports in the shape of sorrow."

To complete it, the manners are so ill observed, that a
Mahometan princess royal is at full liberty to visit her lover
in Newgate, like the banker's daughter in George Barnwell.  I
have added four more "Worlds,"(535) the second of which will, I
think, redeem my lord Chesterfield's character with you for
wit, except in the two stories, which are very flat: I mean
those of two misspelt letters.  In the last "World,"(536)
besides the hand, you will find a story of your acquaintance:
BoncoEur means Norborne Berkeley, whose horse sinking up to his
middle in Woburn park, he would not allow that it was any thing
more than a little damp.  The last story of a highwayman
happened almost literally to Mrs. Cavendish.

For news, I think I have none to tell you.  Mr. Pitt is gone to
the Bath, and Mr. Fox to Newcastle House; and every body else
into the country for the holidays.  When Lord Bath was told of
the first determination of turning out Pitt, and letting Fox
remain, he said it put him in mind of a story of the gunpowder
plot.  The Lord Chamberlain was sent to examine the vaults
under the Parliament-house, and, returning with his report,
said he had found five-and-twenty barrels of gunpowder; that he
had removed ten of them, and hoped the other fifteen would do
no harm.  Was ever any thing so well and so just?

The Russian ambassador is to give a masquerade for the birth of
the little great prince;(537) the King lends him Somerset
House: he wanted to borrow the palace over against me, and sent
to ask it of the cardinal-nephew (538) who replied, "Not for
half Russia."

The new madness is Oratorys.  Macklin has set up one, under the
title of The British Inquisition;(539) Foote another against
him; and a third man has advertised another to-day.  I have not
heard enough in their favour to tempt me to them, nor do I in
the world know enough to compose another paragraph.  I am here
quite alone; Mr. Chute is setting out for his Vine; but in a
day or two I expect Mr. Williams,(540) George Selwyn, and Dick
Edgecumbe.  You will allow that when I do admit any body within
my cloister, I choose them well.  My present occupation is
putting up my books; and thanks to arches and pinnacles, and
pierced columns, I shall not appear scantily provided.  Adieu!

(533) The tragedy of "Barbarossa" met with some success,
principally from the advantages it appeared under, by the
performance of Garrick and Mossop, in the parts of Achmet and
Barbarossa.  Garrick also supplied the prologue and epilogue,.
It being mentioned to Dr. Johnson, that Garrick assisted the
author in the composition of this tragedy, "No, Sir," said the
Doctor, "Browne would no more suffer Garrick to write a line in
his play than he would suffer him to mount his pulpit."-E.

(534) The author was the ingenious but unhappy Dr. John Browne,
who was also author of the "Essays on Satire," occasioned by
the death of Pope, and the celebrated "Estimate of the Manners
and Principles of the Times." He had the misfortune to labour
under a constitutional dejection of spirits; and in September
1766, in an interval of deprivation of reason, put a period to
his existence, in his fifty-first year.-E.

(539) The British Inquisition was opened in 1754, by a public
ordinary, where every person was permitted, for three shillings
a-head, to drink port, or claret, or whatever liquor he should
choose.  This was succeeded by a lecture on oratory.  The plan
did not succeed; for while Macklin was engaged in drilling his
waiters, or fitting himself for the rostrum, his waiters, in
return, were robbing him in all directions; so that, in the
February of this year, he was declared a bankrupt, under the
designation of a vintner.-E.

233 Letter 120
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Jan. 7, 1755.

I imagined by your letter the Colonel was in town, and was
shocked at not having been to wait on him; upon inquiry, I find
he is not; and now, can conceive how he came to tell you, that
the town has been entertained with a paper of mine; I send it
you, to show you that this is one of the many fabulous
histories which have been spread in such quantities, and
without foundation.

I shall take care of your letter to Mr. Bentley.  Mr. Chute is
at the Vine, or I know he would, as I do, beg his compliments
to Miss Montagu.  You do not wish me joy on the approaching
nuptials of Mr. Harris and our Miss Anne. He is so amorous,
that whenever he sits by her, (and he cannot stand by her,) my
Lady Townshend, by a very happy expression, says, "he is always
setting his dress."  Have you heard of a Countess Chamfelt, a
Bohemian, rich and hideous, who is arrived here, and is under
the protection of Lady Caroline Petersham @ She has a great
facility at languages, and has already learned, "D--n you, and
kiss me;" I beg her pardon, I believe she never uses the
former, but upon the miscarriage of the latter: in short, as
Doddington says, she has had the honour of performing at most
courts in Europe.  Adieu!



234 letter 121
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, Jan. 9, 1755.

I used to say that one could not go out of London for two days
without finding at one's return that something very
extraordinary had happened; but of late the climate had lost
its propensity to odd accidents.  Madness be praised, we are a
little restored to the want of our senses!  I have been twice
this Christmas at Strawberry Hill for a few days, and at each
return have been not a little surprised: the last time, at the
very unexpected death of Lord Albemarle,(541) who was taken
ill at Paris, going home from supper, and expired in a few
hours; and last week at the far more extraordinary death of
Montford.(542)  He himself, with all his judgment in bets, I
think would have betted any man in England against himself for
self-murder: yet after having been supposed the sharpest
genius of his time, he, by all that appears, shot himself on
the distress of his circumstances; an apoplectic disposition I
believe concurring, either to lower his spirits, or to alarm
them.  Ever since Miss * * * * lived with him, either from
liking her himself, as some think, or to tempt her to marry
his lilliputian figure, he has squandered vast sums at Horse-
heath, and in living.  He lost twelve hundred a-year by Lord
Albemarle's death, and four by Lord Gage's, the same day.  He
asked immediately for the government of Virginia or the
Foxhounds, and pressed for an answer with an eagerness that
surprised the Duke of Newcastle, who never had a notion of
pinning down the relief of his own or any other man's wants to
a day.  Yet that seems to have been the case of Montford, who
determined to throw the die of life and death, Tuesday was
Se'nnight, on the answer he was to receive from court; which
did not prove favourable.  He consulted indirectly, and at
last pretty directly several people on the easiest method of
finishing life; and seems to have thought that he had been too
explicit; for he invited company to dinner for the day after
his death, and ordered a supper at Whites, where he Supped,
too, the night before.  He played at whist till one in the
morning; it was New Year's morning - Lord Robert Bertie drank
to him a happy new year; he clapped his hands strangely to his
eyes! In the morning he had a lawyer and three witnesses, and
executed his will, which he made them read twice over,
paragraph by paragraph: and then asking the lawyer if that
will would stand good, though a man were to shoot himself? and
being assured it would; he said, " Pray stay while I step into
the next room;"=-went into the next room and shot himself.  He
clapped the pistol so close to his head, that they heard no
report.  The housekeeper heard him fall, and, thinking he had
a fit, ran up with drops, and found his skull and brains shot
about the room You will be charmed with the friendship and
generosity of Sir Francis.  Montford a little time since
opened his circumstances to him.  Sir Francis said, "Montford,
if it will be of any service to you, you shall see what I have
done for you;" pulled out his will, and read it, where he had
left him a vast legacy.  The beauty of this action is
heightened by Sir Francis's life not being worth a year's
purchase.  I own I feel for the distress this man must have
felt, before he decided on so desperate an action.  I knew him
but little; but he was good-natured and agreeable enough, and
had the most compendious understanding I ever knew.  He had
affected a finesse in money matters beyond what he deserved,
and aimed at reducing even natural affections to a kind of
calculations, like Demoivre's.  He was asked, soon after his
daughter's marriage, if she was with child: he replied, "upon
my word, I don't know; I have no bet upon it."  This and poor
* * * *'s self-murder have brought to light another, which
happening in France, had been sunk; * * * *'s.  I can tell you
that the ancient and worshipful company- of lovers are under a
great dilemma, upon a husband and a gamester killing
themselves: I don't know whether they will not apply to
Parliament for an exclusive charter for self-murder.

On the occasion of Montford's story, I heard another more
extraordinary.  If a man insures his life, this killing
himself vacates the bargain; This (as in England almost every
thing begets a contradiction) has produced an office for
insuring in spite of self-murder; but not beyond three hundred
pounds.  I suppose voluntary deaths were not the bon-ton. of
people in higher life.  A man went and insured his life,
securing this privilege of a free-dying Englishman.  He
carried the insurers to dine at a tavern, where they met
several other persons.  After dinner he said to the
life--and-death brokers, "Gentlemen, it is fit that you should
be acquainted with the company: these honest men are
tradesmen, to whom I was in debt, without any means of paying,
but by your assistance; and now I am your humble servant!"  He
pulled out a pistol and shot himself.  Did you ever hear of
such a mixture of honesty and knavery?

Lord Rochford is to succeed as groom of the stole.  The Duke
of Marlborough is privy-seal, in the room of Lord Gower, who
is dead; and the Duke of Rutland is lord steward.  Lord
Albemarle's other offices and honours are still in petto.
When the king first saw this Lord Albemarle, he said, "Your
father had a great many good qualities, but he was a sieve!"-
-It is 'the last receiver into which I should have thought his
Majesty would have poured gold! You will be pleased with the
monarch's politesse.  Sir John Bland and Offley made interest
to play at Twelfth-night, and succeeded--not at play, for they
lost 1400 pounds and 1300 pounds.  As it is not usual for
people of no higher rank to play, the King thought they would
be bashful about it, and took particular care to do the
honours of his house to them, set only to them, and spoke to
them at his levee next morning.

You love new nostrums and ]Inventions: there is discovered a
method of inoculating the cattle for the distemper-it succeeds
so well that they are not even marked.  How we advance rapidly
in discoveries, and in applying every thing to every thing!
Here is another secret, that will better answer your purpose,
and I hope mine too.  They found out lately at the Duke of
Argyle's, that any kind of ink may be made of privet: it
becomes green ink by mixing salt of tartar.  I don't know the
process; but I am promised it by Campbell, who told me of it
t'other day, when I carried him the true genealogy of the
Bentleys, which he assured me shall be inserted in the next
edition of the Biographia.

There sets out to-morrow morning, by the Southampton wagon,
such a cargo of trees for you, that a detachment of Kentishmen
would be furnished against an invasion if they were to unroll
the bundle.  I write to Mr. S * * * * to recommend great care
of them.  Observe how I answer your demands: are you as
punctual? The forests in your landscapes do not thrive like
those in' your letters.  Here is a letter from G. Montagu; and
then I think I may bid you good-night!

(541) In his "Memoires," Vol. i. p. 366, Walpole says, "He
died suddenly at Paris, where his mistress had sold him to the
French court."  A writer in the Quarterly Review, Vol Ixii. p.
5, states that what he here asserts was generally believed in
Paris; for that, in the "M`emoires Secrets," published in
continuation of Bachaumont's Journal, it is said, on occasion
of the Count d'Herouville's death in 1782, that " he had been
talked of for the ministry under Louis XV. and would probably
have obtained it, had it not been for 'son mariage trop
in`egal.  Il avait `epous`e la fameuse Lolotte maitresse du
Comte d'Albemarle, l'ambassadeur d'Angleterre, laquelle
servait d'espion au minist`ere de France aupr`es de son amant,
et a touch`e en cons`equence jusqu'`a sa mort une pension de
la cour de 12,000 livres.'  But if the French court purchased,
as he reports, and as is sufficiently probable, instructions
of our ambassador, they could have learned from them nothing
to facilitate their own schemes of aggression--nothing but
what they knew before; for the policy of England, defective as
it might be on other points, had this great and paramount
advantage,-that it was open, honest, and straightforward."-E.

236 Letter 122
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 9, 1755.

I had an intention of deferring writing to you, my dear Sir,
till I could wish you joy on the completion of your
approaching dignity:(543) but as the Duke of Newcastle is not
quite so expeditious as my friendship is earnest; and as your
brother tells me that you have had some very unnecessary
qualms, from your silence to me on this chapter, I can no
longer avoid telling you how pleased I am with any accession
of distinction to you and your family; I should like nothing
better but an accession of appointments: but I shall say no
more on this head, where wishes are so barren as mine.  Your
brother, who had not time to write by this post, desires me to
tell you that the Duke will be obliged to you, if you will
send him the new map of Rome and of the patrimony of St.
Peter, which his Royal Highness says is just published.

You will have heard long before you receive this, of Lord
Albemarle's(544) sudden death at Paris: every body is so sorry
for him!--without being so: yet as sorry as he would have been
for any body, or as he deserved.  Can one really regret a man,
who, with the most meritorious wife(545) and sons(546) in the
world, and with near 15,000 pounds a year from the government,
leaves not a shilling to his family, lawful or illegitimate,
(and both very numerous,) but dies immensely in debt, though,
when he married, he had 90,000 pounds, in the funds, and my
Lady Albemarle brought him 25,000 pounds more, all which is
dissipated to 14,000 pounds! The King very handsomely, and
tired with having done so much for a man who had so little
pretensions to it, immediately gave my Lady Albemarle 1200
pounds a year pension, and I trust will take care of this
Lord, who is a great friend of mine, and what is much better
for him, the first favourite of the Duke.  If I were as grave
an historian as my Lord Clarendon, I should now without any
scruple tell you a dream; you would either believe it from my
dignity of character, or conclude from my dignity of character
that I did not believe it myself.  As neither of these
important evasions will serve my turn, I shall relate the
following, only prefacing, that I do believe the dream
happened, and happened right among the millions of dreams that
do not hit.  Lord Bury was at Windsor with the Duke when the
express of his father's death arrived: he came to town time
enough to find his mother and sisters at breakfast. "Lord!
child," said my Lady Albemarle, "what brings you to town so
early?"  He said he had been sent for.  Says she "You are not
well!"  "Yes," replied Lord Bury, "I am, but a little
flustered with something I have heard."  "Let me feel your
pulse," said Lady Albemarle: "Oh!" continued she, "your father
is dead!"  "Lord Madam," said Lord Bury, "how could that come
into your head?  I should rather have imagined that you would
have thought it was my poor brother William" (who is just gone
to Lisbon for his health).  "No," said my Lady Albemarle, "I
know it is your father; I dreamed last night that he was dead,
and came to take leave of me!" and immediately swooned.

Lord Albemarle's places are not yet given away: ambassador at
Paris, I suppose, there will be none; it was merely kept up to
gratify him-besides, when we have no minister we can deliver
no memorials.  Lord Rochford is, I quite believe, to be groom
of the stole: that leaves your Turin open--besides such
trifles as a blue garter, the second troop of Guards, and the
government of Virginia.

A death much more extraordinary is that of my Lord Mountford,
who, having all his life aimed at the character of a moneyed
man, and of an artfully money-getting man, has shot himself,
on having ruined himself.  If he had despised money, he could
not have shot himself with more deliberate resolution.  The
Only points he seems to have considered in so mad an action,
were, not to be thought mad, and which would be the easiest
method of despatching Himself.  It is strange that the passage
from life to death should be an object, when One is unhappy
enough to be determined to change one for the other.

I warned you in my last not to wonder if you should hear that
either Mr. Pitt or Mr. Fox had kissed hands for secretary of
state; the latter has kissed the secretary of State's hand for
being a cabinet councillor.(547)  The more I see, the more I
am confirmed in my idea of this being the age of abortions.

I have received yours of December 13th, and find myself
obliged to my Lord of Cork for a remembrance of me, which I
could not expect he should have preserved.  Lord Huntingdon I
know very well, and like very much: he has parts, great good
breeding, and will certainly make a figure.  You are lucky in
such company; yet I wish you had Mr. Brand!

I need not desire you not to believe the stories of such a
mountebank as Taylor:(548) I only wonder that he should think
the names of our family a recommendation at Rome; we are not
conscious of any such merit: nor have any Of our eyes ever
wanted to be put out.  Adieu! my dear Sir, my dear Sir Horace.

be removed to bigger stations.  Fox, during the whole

very frank, very explicit, and not very unreasonable."

238 Letter 123
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, Feb. 8, 1755.

My dear sir,
By the wagon on Thursday there set out for Southampton a lady
whom you must call Phillis, but whom George Montagu and the
Gods would name Speckle-belly.  Peter begged her for me; that
is, for you; that is, for Captain Dumaresque, after he had
been asked three guineas for another.  I hope she will not be
poisoned with salt-water, like the poor Poyangers.(549)  If
she should, you will at least observe, that your commissions
are not stillborn with me, as mine are with you.  I draw(550)
a spotted dog, the moment you desire it.

George Montagu has intercepted the description I promised you
of the Russian masquerade: he wrote to beg it, and I cannot
transcribe from myself.  In a few words, there were all the
beauties, and all the diamonds, and not a few of the uglies of
London.  The Duke,(551) like Osman the Third, seemed in the
centre of his new seraglio, and I believe my lady and I
thought that my Lord Anson was the chief eunuch.  My Lady
Coventry was dressed in a great style, and looked better than
ever.  Lady Betty Spencer, like Rubens's wife (not the common
one with the hat), had all the bloom and bashfulness and
wildness of youth, with all the countenance of all the former
Marlboroughs.  Lord Delawar was an excellent mask, from a
picture at Kensington of Queen Elizabeth's porter.  Lady
Caroline Petersham, powdered with diamonds and crescents for a
Turkish slave, was still extremely handsome.  The hazard was
excessively deep, to the astonishment of some Frenchmen of
quality who are here, and who I believe, from what they saw
that night, will not write to their court to dissuade their
armaments, on its not being worth their while to attack so
beggarly a nation.  Our fleet is as little despicable; but
though the preparations on both sides are so great, I believe
the storm will blow over.  They insist on our immediately
sending an ambassador to Paris; and to my great satisfaction,
my cousin and friend Lord Hertford is to be the man.  This is
still an entire secret here, but will be known before you
receive this.  The weather is very bitter, and keeps me from
Strawberry.  Adieu!

(549) Mr. Walpole having called his gold-fish pond Poyang,
calls the gold-fish Poyangers.

pencil at the request of Mr. Walpole.

239 Letter 124
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, Feb. 23, 1755.

My dear sir,
Your argosie is arrived safe; thank you for shells, trees,
cones; but above all, thank you for the landscape.  As it is
your first attempt in oils, and has succeeded so much beyond
my expectation, (and being against my advice too, you may
believe the sincerity of my praises,) I must indulge my
Vasarihood, and write a dissertation upon it.  You have united
and mellowed your colours, in a manner to make it look like an
old picture; yet there is something in the tone of it that is
not quite right.  Mr. Chute thinks that you should have
exerted more of your force in tipping with light the edges on
which the sun breaks: my own opinion is, that the result of
the whole is not natural, by your having joined a Claude
Lorrain summer sky to a winter sea, which you have drawn from
the life.  The water breaks fine] but the distant hills are
too strong, and the outlines much too hard ..The greatest
fault is the trees (not apt to be your stumbling-block): they
are not of a natural green, have no particular resemblance,
and are out of all proportion too large for the figures.  Mend
these errors, and work away in oil.  I am impatient to see
some Gothic ruins of your painting.  This leads me naturally
to thank you for the sweet little cul-de-lampe to the entail
it is equal to any thing you have done in perspective and for
taste but the boy is too large.

For the block of granite I shall certainly think a louis well
bestowed--provided I do but get the block, and that you are
sure it will be equal to the sample you sent me.  My room
remains in want of a table; and as it will take so much time
to polish it, I do wish you would be a little expeditious in
sending it.

I have but frippery news to tell you; no politics; for the
rudiments of a war, that is not to be a war, are not worth
detailing.         In short, we have acted with spirit, have
got ready thirty ships of the line, and conclude that the
French will not care to examine whether they are well manned
or not.  The House of Commons hears nothing but elections; the
Oxfordshire till seven at night three times a week: we have
passed ten evenings on the Colchester election, and last
Monday sat upon it till near two in the morning.  Whoever
stands a contested election, and pays for his seat, and
attends the first session, surely buys the other six very
dear!

The great event is the catastrophe of Sir John Bland(552) who
has flirted away his whole fortune at hazard.  He t'other
night exceeded what was lost by the late Duke of Bedford,
having at one period of the night (though he recovered the
greatest part of it) lost two-and-thirty thousand pounds.  The
citizens put on their double-channeled pumps and trudge to St.
James's Street, in expectation of seeing judgments executed on
White's--angels with flaming swords, and devils flying away
with dice-boxes, like the prints in Sadeler's Hermits.  Sir
John lost this immense sum to a Captain * @ * * *, who at
present has nothing but a few debts and his commission.

Garrick has produced a detestable English opera, which is
crowded by all true lovers of their country.  To mark the
opposition to Italian operas, it is sung by some cast singers,
two Italians, and a French girl, and the chapel boys; and to
regale us with sense, it is Shakspeare's Midsummer Night's
Dream, which is forty times more nonsensical than the worst
translation of any Italian opera-books.  But such sense and
such harmony are irresistible!

I am at present confined with a cold, which I caught by going
to a fire in the middle of the night, and in the middle of the
snow, two days ago.  About five in the morning Harry waked me
with a candle in his hand, and cried, "Pray, your honour,
don't be frightened!"--"No, Harry, I am not: but what is it
that I am not to be frightened at?" --"There is a great fire
here in St. James's Street."--I rose, and indeed thought all
St. James's Street was on fire, but it proved in Bury Street.
However, you know I can't resist going to a fire; for it Is
certainly the only horrid sight that is fine.  I slipped on my
slippers, and an embroidered suit that hung on the chair, and
ran to Bury Street, and stepped into a pipe that was broken up
for water.--It would have made a picture--the horror of the
flames, the snow, the day breaking with difficulty through so
foul a night, and my figure, party per pale, mud and gold.  It
put me in mind of Lady Margaret Herbert's providence, who
asked somebody for a pretty pattern for a nightcap. "Lord!"
said they, "what signifies the pattern for a nightcap?"  "Oh!
child," said she, "but you know, in case of fire."  There were
two houses burnt, and a poor maid; an officer jumped out of
window, and is much hurt, and two young beauties were conveyed
out the same way in their shifts.  there have been two more
great fires.  Alderman Belchier's house at Epsom, that
belonged to the Prince, is burnt, and Beckford's fine
house(553) in the country, with pictures and furniture to a
great value.  He says, "Oh! I have an odd fifty thousand
pounds in a drawer: I will build it up again: it won't be
above a thousand pounds apiece difference to my thirty
children." Adieu!

241 letter 125
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, March 6, 1755.

My dear sir,
I have to thank you for two letters and a picture.  I hope my
thanks will have a more prosperous journey than my own letters
have had of late.  You say you have received none since
January 9th.  I have written three since that.  I take care,
in conjunction with the times, to make them harmless enough
for the post.  Whatever secrets I may have (and you know I
have no propensity to mystery) will keep very well till I have
the happiness of seeing you, though that date should be
farther off than I hope.  As I mean my letters should relieve
some of your anxious or dull minutes, I will tempt no
postmasters or secretaries to retard them.  The state of
affairs is much altered since my last epistle that persuaded
you of the distance of a war.  So haughty and so ravenous an
answer came from France, that my Lord Hertford does not go.
As a little islander, you may be very easy: Jersey is not prey
for such fleets as are likely to encounter in the channel in
April.  You must tremble in your Bigendian capacity, if you
mean to figure as a good citizen.  I sympathize with you
extremely in the interruption it will give to our
correspondence.  You, in an inactive little spot, cannot wish
more impatiently for every post that has the probability of a
letter, than I, in all the turbulence of London, do
constantly, never-failingly, for letters from you.  Yet by my
busy, hurried, amused, irregular way of life, you would not
imagine that I had much time to care for my friends@ You know
how late I used to rise: it is worse and worse: I stay late at
debates and committees; for, with all our tranquillity and my
indifference, I think I am never out of the House of Commons:
from thence, it is the fashion of the winter to go to vast
assemblies, which are followed by vast suppers, and those by
balls.  Last week I was from two at noon till ten at night at
the House: I came home, dined, new-dressed myself entirely,
went to a ball at Lord Holderness's, and stayed till five in
the morning.  What an abominable young creature! But why may
not I be so! Old Haslang(554) dances at sixty-five; my Lady
Rochford without stays, and her husband the new groom of the
stole, dance.  In short, when secretaries of state, cabinet
councillors, foreign ministers, dance like the universal
ballet in the Rehearsal, why should not I--see them?  In
short, the true definition of me is, that I am a dancing
senator--Not that I do dance, or do any thing by being a
senator: but I go to balls, and to the House of Commons-to
look on: and you will believe me when I tell you, that I
really think the former the more serious occupation of the
two; at least the performers are most in earnest.  What men
say to women, is at least as sincere as what they say to their
country.  If perjury can give the devil a right to the souls
of men, he has titles by as many ways as my Lord Huntingdon is
descended from Edward the Third.

the British court.-E.



242 Letter 126
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 10, 1755.

having already wished you joy of your chivalry, I would not
send you a formal congratulation on the actual despatch of
your patent: I had nothing new to tell you: forms between you
and me would be new indeed.

You have heard of the nomination of my friend and relation,
Lord Hertford,(555) to the embassy of Paris: you will by this
time have learned or perceived, that he is not likely to go
thither.  They have sent demands too haughty to be admitted,
and we are preparing a fleet to tell them we think so.  In
short, the prospect is very warlike.  The ministry are so
desirous of avoiding it, that they make no preparations on
land--will that prevent it?--Their partisans d-n the
plantations, and ask if we are to involve ourselves in a war
for them?  Will that question weigh with planters and West
Indians?  I do not love to put our trust in a fleet only:
however, we do not touch upon the Pretender; the late
rebellion suppressed is a comfortable ingredient, at least, in
a new war.  You know I call this the age of abortions: who
knows but the egg of this war may be addled?

Elections, very warm in their progress, very insignificant in
their consequence, very tedious in their attendance, employ
the Parliament solely.  The King wants to go abroad, and
consequently to have the Houses prorogued: the Oxfordshire
election says no to him: the war says no to him: the town say
we shall sit till June.  Balls, masquerades, and diversions
don't trouble their heads about the Parliament or the war: the
righteous, who hate pleasures and love prophecies, (the most
unpleasant things in the world, except their completion,) are
finding out parallels between London and Nineveh, and other
goodly cities of old, who went to operas and ridottos when the
French were at their gates--yet, if Arlington Street were ten
times more like to the most fashionable street in Tyre or
Sidon, it should not alarm me: I took all my fears out in the
rebellion: I was frightened enough then; I will never have
another panic.  I would not indeed be so pedantic as to sit in
St. James's market in an armed chair to receive the French,
because the Roman consuls received the Gauls in the forum.
They shall be in Southwark before I pack up a single
miniature.

The Duke of Dorset goes no more to Ireland: Lord Hartington is
to be sent thither with the olive branch.  Lord Rochford is
groom of the stole; Lord Poulet has resigned the bedchamber on
that preference, and my nephew and Lord Essex are to be lords
of the bedchamber.  It is supposed that the Duke of Rutland
will be master of the horse, and the Dorset again lord
steward.  But all this will come to you as very antique news,
if a whisper that your brother has heard to-day be true, of
your having taken a trip to Rome.  If you are there when you
receive this, pray make my Lady Pomfret's(556) compliments to
the statues in the Capitol, and inform them that she has
purchased her late lord's collection of statues, and presented
them to the University of Oxford.  The present Earl, her son,
is grown a speaker in the House of Lords, and makes
comparisons between Julius Caesar and the watchmen of Bristol,
in the same style as he compared himself to Cerberus, who,
when he had one head cut off three others sprang up in its
room.  I shall go to-morrow to Dr. Mead's sale, and ruin
myself in bronzes and vases--but I will not give them to the
University of Oxford.  Adieu! my dear Sir Knight.

had been purchased by his grandfather.



243 Letter 127
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, March 27, 1755.

Your chimney(557) is come, but not to honour: the caryatides
are fine and free, but the rest is heavy: Lord Strafford is
not at all struck with it, and thinks it old-fashioned: it
certainly tastes of Inigo Jones.

Your myrtles I have seen in their pots, and they are
magnificent, but I fear very sickly.  In return, I send you a
library.  You will receive, some time or other, or the French
for you, the following books: a fourth volume of Dodsley's
Collection Of Poems, the worst tome of the four; three volumes
of Worlds; Fielding's Travels, or rather an account how his
dropsy was treated and teased by an inn-keeper's wife in the
Isle of Wight; the new Letters of Madame de S`evign`e, and
Hume's History of Great Britain; a book which, though more
decried than ever book was, and certainly with faults, I
cannot help liking much.  It is called Jacobite, but in my
opinion is only not George-abite: where others abuse the
Stuarts, he laughs at them: I am sure he does not spare their
ministers.  Harding,(558) who has the History of England at
the ends of his parliament fingers, says, that the Journals
will contradict most of his facts.  If it is so, I am sorry;
for his style, which is the best we have in history, and his
manner imitated from Voltaire, are very pleasing.  He has
showed very clearly that we ought to quarrel originally with
Queen Elizabeth's tyranny for most of the errors of Charles
the First.  As long as he is Willing to sacrifice some royal
head, I would not much dispute with him which it should be.  I
incline every day to lenity, as I see more and more that it is
being very partial to think worse of some men than of others.
If I was a king myself, I dare say I should cease to love a
republic.  My Lady Rochford desired me t'other day to give her
a motto for a ruby ring, which had been given by a handsome
woman of quality to a fine man; he gave it to his mistress,
she to Lord * * * * *, he to my lady: who, I think, does not
deny that it has not yet finished its travels.  I excused
myself for some time, on the difficulty of reducing such a
history to a poesy--at last I proposed this:

"This was given by woman to man, and by man to woman."

Are you most impatient to hear of a French war, or the event
of the Mitchell election?  If the former is uppermost in your
thoughts, I can tell you, you are very unfashionable.' The
Whigs and Tories at Rome, Athens, and Jerusalem never forgot
national points with more zeal, to attend to private faction,
than we have lately.  After triumphs repeated in the
committee, Lord Sandwich and Mr. Fox were beaten largely on
the report.  It was a most extraordinary day!  The Tories, who
could not trust one another for two hours, had their last
consult at the Horn Tavern just before the report, and all but
nine or ten voted in a body (with the Duke of Newcastle)
against agreeing to it: then Sir John Philipps, one of them,
moved for a void election, but was deserted by most of his
clan.  We now begin to turn our hands to foreign war.  In the
rebellion, the ministry was so unsettled that nobody seemed to
care who was king.  Power is now so established that I must do
the engrossers the justice to say, that they seem to be
determined that their own King shall continue so.  Our fleet
is great and well manned; we are raising men and money, and
messages have been sent to both houses from St. James's, which
have been answered by very zealous cards.  In the mean time,
sturdy mandates are arrived from France; however with a
codicil of moderation, and power to Mirepoix still to treat.
He was told briskly "Your terms must come speedily; the fleets
will sail very quickly; war cannot then be avoided."

I have passed five entire days lately at Dr. Mead's sale,
where, however, I bought very little: as extravagantly as he
paid for every thing, his name has even resold them with
interest.  Lord Rockingham gave two hundred and thirty guineas
for the Antinous--the dearest bust that, I believe, was ever
sold; yet the nose and chin were repaired and very ill.  Lord
Exeter bought the Homer for one hundred and thirty.  I must
tell you a piece of fortune: I supped the first night of the
sale at Bedford-house, and found my Lord Gower dealing at
silver pharaoh to the women. "Oh!" said I laughing, "I laid
out six-and-twenty pounds this morning, I will try if I can
win it back," and threw a shilling upon a card: in five
minutes I won a five-hundred leva, which was twenty-five
pounds eleven shillings.  I have formerly won a thousand leva,
and at another five hundred leva.  With such luck, shall not I
be able to win you back again?

Last Wednesday I gave a feast in form to the Hertfords.  There
was the Duke of Grafton, Lord and Lady Hertford, Mr. Conway,
and Lady Ailesbury; in short, all the Conways in the world, my
Lord Orford, and the Churchills.  We dined in the drawing-room
below stairs, amidst the Eagle, Vespasian, etc.  You never saw
so Roman a banquet; but withal my virt`u, the bridegroom
seemed the most venerable piece of antiquity.  Good night! The
books go to Southampton on Monday.  Yours ever.

desire, Mr. Bentley had made for Lord Strafford.

245 Letter 128
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, April 13, 1755.

If I did not think that you would expect to hear often from me
at so critical a season, I should certainly not write to you
to-night: I am here alone, out of spirits, and not well.  In
short, I have depended too much upon my constitution being
like

"Grass, that escapes the scythe by being low"

and having nothing of the oak in the sturdiness of my stature,
I imagined that my mortality would remain pliant as long as I
pleased.  But I have taken so little care of myself this
winter, and kept such bad hours, that I have brought a slow
fever upon my nights, and am worn to a skeleton: Bethel has
plump cheeks to mine.  However, as it would be unpleasant to
die just at the beginning of a war, I am taking exercise and
air, and much sleep, and intend to see Troy taken.  The
prospect thickens; there are certainly above twelve thousand
men at the Isle of Rh`e; some say twenty thousand.  An express
was yesterday despatched to Ireland, where it is supposed the
storm will burst; but unless our fleet can disappoint the
embarkation, I don't see what service the notification can do:
we have quite disgarnished that kingdom of troops; and if they
once land, ten thousand men may walk from one end of the
island to the other.  It begins to be thought that the King
will not go abroad; that he cannot, every body has long
thought.  You will be entertained with a prophecy which my
Lord Chesterfield has found in the 35th chapter of Ezekiel,
which clearly promises us victory over the French, and
expressly relates to this war, as it mentions the two
countries (Nova Scotia and Acadia) which are the point in
dispute.  You will have no difficulty in allowing that
mounseer, is typical enough of France: except Cyrus, who is
the only heathen prince mentioned by his right name, and that
before he had any name, I know no power so expressly
described.

"2. Son of man, set thy face against Mount Seir, and prophecy
against it.  3. And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord God: O
Mount Seir, I am against thee; and I will stretch out mine
hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.  4. I
will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, etc.
10. Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two
countries shall be mine, and we will possess it."

I am disposed to put great trust in this prediction; for I
know few things more in our favour.  You will ask me
naturally, what is to become of you? Are you to be left to all
the chance of war, the uncertainty of packets, the difficulty
of remittance, the increase of prices?--My dear sir, do you
take me for a prime minister, who acquaints the states that
they are in damned danger, when it is about a day too late? Or
shall I order my chancellor to assure you, that this is
numerically the very day on which it is fit to give such
notification, and that a day sooner or a day later would be
improper?-- But not to trifle politically with you, your
redemption is nearer than you think for, though not complete:
the terms a little depend upon yourself.  You must send me an
account, strictly and upon your honour, what your debts are:
as there is no possibility for the present but of compounding
them, I put my friendship upon it, that you answer me
sincerely.  Should you, upon the hopes of facilitating your
return, not deal ingenuously with me, which I will not
suspect, it would occasion what I hope will never happen.
Some overtures are going to be made to Miss * * * *, to ward
off impediments from her.  In short, though I cannot explain
any of the means, your fortune wears another face; and if you
send me immediately, upon your honour, a faithful account of
what I ask, no time will be lost to labour your return, which
I wish so much, and of which I have said so little lately, as
I have had better hopes of it.  Don't joke with me upon this
head, as you sometimes do: be explicit, be open in the most
unbounded manner, and deal like a man of sense with a heart
that deserves that you should have no disguises to it.  You
know me and my style: when I engage earnestly as I do in this
business, I can't bear not to be treated in my own way.

Sir Charles Williams is made ambassador to Russia; which
concludes all I know.  But at such a period two days may
produce much, and I shall not send away my letter till I am in
town on Tuesday.  Good night!

Thursday, 17th.

All the officers of the Irish establishment are ordered over
thither immediately: Lord Hartington has offered to go
directly,(559) and sets out with Mr. Conway this day
se'nnight.  The journey to Hanover is positive: what if there
should be a crossing-over and figuring-in of kings?  I know
who don't think all this very serious; so that, if you have a
mind to be in great spirits, you may quote Lord Hertford.  He
went to visit the Duchess of Bedford t'other morning, just
after Lord Anson had been there and told her his opinion.  She
asked Lord Hertford what news? He knew none.  "Don't you hear
there will be certainly war?"  "No, Madam: I saw Mr. Nugent
yesterday, and he did not tell me any thing of it."  She
replied, "I have Just seen a man who must know, and who thinks
it unavoidable."  "Nay, Madam, perhaps it may: I don't think a
little war would do us any harm." Just as if he had said,
losing a little blood in spring is very wholesome; or that a
little hissing would not do the Mingotti any harm!

I went t'other morning to see the sale of Mr. Pelham's plate,
with George Selwyn--"Lord!" says he, "how many toads have been
eaten off those plates!"  Adieu!  I flatter myself that this
will be a comfortable letter to you: but I must repeat, that I
expect a very serious answer, and very sober resolutions.  If
I treat you like a child, consider you have been so.  I know I
am in the right--more delicacy would appear kinder, without
being so kind.  As I wish and intend to restore and establish
your happiness, I shall go thoroughly to work.  You don't want
an apothecary, but a surgeon--but I shall give you over at
once, if you are either froward or relapse.  Yours till then.

(559) As viceroy.



247 Letter 129
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 22, 1755.

My dear sir,
Your brother and Mr. Chute have just left me in the design of
writing to you; that is, I promised your brother I would, if I
could make out a letter.  I have waited these ten days,
expecting to be able to send you a war at least, if not an
invasion.  For so long, we have been persuaded that an attempt
would be made on Ireland; we have fetched almost all the
troops from thence; and therefore we have just now ordered all
the officers thither, and the new Lord Lieutenant is going to
see if he has any government left: the old Lord Lieutenant
goes on Sunday to see whether he has any Electorate left.
Your brother says, he hears to-day that the French fleet are
sailed for America: I doubt it; and that the New-Englanders
have been forming a secret expedition, and by this time have
taken Cape Breton again, or something very considerable.  I
remember when the former account came of that conquest, I was
stopped in my chariot, and told, "Cape Breton is taken." I
thought the person said "Great Britain is taken." "Oh!" said
I, "I am not at all surprised at that; drive on, coachman."
If you should hear that the Pretender and the Pretend@e have
crossed over and figured in, shall you be much more surprised?

Mr. Chute and I have been motto-hunting(560) for you, but we
have had no sport.  The sentence that puns the best upon your
name, and suits the best with your nature, is too old, too
common, and belongs already to the Talbots, Humani nihil
alienum.  The motto that punning upon your name suits best
with your public character, is the most heterogeneous to your
private, Homo Homini Lupus--forgive my puns, I hate them; but
it shows how I have been puzzled, and how little I have
succeeded.  If I could pity Stosch, it would be for the edict
by which Richcourt incorporates his collection-but when he is
too worthless to be pitied living, can one feel for a hardship
that is not to happen to him till he is dead? How ready 1
should be to quarrel with the Count for such a law, if I was
driving to Louis,(561) at the Palazzo Vecchio!

Adieu! my dear child; I am sensible that this is a very scrap
of a letter; but unless the Kings of England and France will
take more care to supply our correspondence, and not be so
dilatory, is it my fault that I am so concise? Sure, if they
knew how much postage they lost, by not supplying us with
materials for letters, they would not mind flinging away eight
or ten thousand men every fortnight.

(560) It was necessary for him to have a motto to his arms, as
a baronet.

curiosities, and lodged in the old palace at Florence.



248 Letter 130
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, April 24, 1755.

I don't doubt but you will conclude that this letter, written
so soon after my last, comes to notify a great sea-victory, or
defeat; or that the French are landed in Ireland, and have
taken and fortified Cork; that they have been joined by all
the wild Irish, who have proclaimed the Pretender, and are
charmed with the prospect of being governed by a true
descendant of the Mac-na-O's; or that the King of Prussia,
like an unnatural nephew, has seized his uncle and Schutz in a
post-chaise, and obliged them to hear the rehearsal of a
French opera of his own composing--No such thing! If you will
be guessing, you will guess wrong--all I mean to tell you is,
that thirteen gold fish, caparisoned in coats of mail, as rich
as if Mademoiselle Scuderi had invented their armour, embarked
last Friday on a secret expedition; which, as Mr. Weekes(562)
and the wisest politicians of Twickenham concluded, was
designed against the island of Jersey-but to their consummate
mortification, Captain Chevalier is detained by a law-suit,
and the poor Chinese adventurers are
 now frying under deck below bridge.  In short, if your
governor is to have any gold fish, you must come and manage
their transport yourself.  Did you receive my last letter? If
you did, you will not think it impossible that you should
preside at such an embarkation.

The war is quite gone out of fashion, and seems adjourned to
America: though I am disappointed, I am not surprised.  You
know my despair about this eventless age! How pleasant to have
lived in times when one could have been sure every week of
being able to write such a paragraph as this!--"We hear that
the Christians who were on their voyage for the recovery of
the Holy Land, have been massacred in Cyprus by the natives,
who were provoked at a rape and murder committed in a church
by some young noblemen belonging to the Nuncio"--; or--
"Private letters from Rome attribute the death of his Holiness
to poison, which they pretend was given to him in the
sacrament, by the Cardinal of St. Cecilia, whose mistress he
had debauched.  The same letters add, that this Cardinal
stands the fairest for succeeding to the Papal tiara; though a
natural son of the late Pope is supported by the whole
interest of Arragon and Naples."  Well! since neither the Pope
nor the most Christian King, will play the devil, I must
condescend to tell you flippancies of less dignity.  There is
a young Frenchman here, called Monsieur Herault. Lady
Harrington carried him and his governor to sup with her and
Miss Ashe at a tavern t'other night. I have long said that the
French were relapsed into barbarity, and quite ignorant of the
world.  You shall judge: in the first place, the young man was
bashful: in the next, the governor, so ignorant as not to have
heard of women of fashion carrying men to a tavern, thought it
incumbent upon him to do the honours for his pupil, who was as
modest and as much in a state of nature as the ladies
themselves, and hazarded some familiarities with Lady
Harrington.  The consequence was, that the next morning she
sent a card-to both, to desire they would not come to her ball
that evening, to which she had invited them, and to beg the
favour of them never to come into her house again.  Adieu! I
am prodigal of my letters, as I hope not to write you many
more.

250 Letter 131
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 4, as they call it, but the weather andthe
almanack of my feelings affirm it is December.

I will answer your questions as well as I can, though I must
do it shortly, for I write in a sort of hurry.  Osborn could
not find Lord Cutts,(563) but I have discovered another, in an
auction, for which I shall bid for you.  Mr. Muntz has been at
Strawberry these three weeks, tight at work, so your picture
is little advanced, but as soon as he returns it shall be
finished.  I have chosen the marbles for your tomb; but you
told me you had agreed on the price, which your steward now
says I was to settle.  Mr. Bentley still waits the conclusion
of the session, before he can come amongst us again.  Every
thing has passed with great secrecy: one would think the devil
was afraid of being tried for his life, for he has not even
directed Madame Bentley to the Old Bailey.  Mr. Mann does not
mend, but how should he in such weather?

We wait with impatience for news from Minorca. there is a
Prince of Nassau Welbourg, who wants to marry Princess
Caroline of Orange; he is well-looking enough, but a little
too tame to cope with such blood.  He is established at the
Duke of Richmond's, with a large train, for two months.  He
was last night at a great ball at my Lady Townshend's, whose
Audrey will certainly get Lord George Lenox.(564)  George
Selwyn, t'other night, seeing Lady Euston with Lady Petersham,
said, "There's my Lady Euston, and my Lady us'd to't."  Adieu!

(563) Sir John, created Lord Cutts of Gowran in 1690,
distinguished himself at the siege of Buda: he accompanied
King William to England, was made a lieutenant-general, and
died without issue in 1707.  Sir Richard Steele dedicated to
him his "Christian Hero."  Lord Cutts married Mr. Montagu's
grandmother; he was her third husband.-E.

the Marquis of Lothian.  Audrey married Captain Orme.-E.



250 Letter 132
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 6, 1755.

My dear sir,
Do you get my letters'! or do I write only for the
entertainment of the clerks of the post-office? I have not
heard from you this month!  It will be very unlucky if my last
to you has miscarried, as it required an answer, of importance
to you, and very necessary to my satisfaction.

I told you of Lord Poulet's intended motion.  He then
repented, and wrote to my Lady Yarmouth and Mr. Fox to mediate
his pardon.  Not contented with his reception, he determined
to renew his intention.  Sir Cordell Firebrace(565) took it
up, and intended to move the same address in the Commons, but
was prevented by a sudden adjournment.  However, the last day
but one of the session, Lord Poulet read his motion, which was
a speech.  My Lord Chesterfield (who of all men living seemed
to have no business to defend the Duke of Newcastle after much
the same sort of ill usage) said the motion was improper, and
moved to adjourn.(566)  T'other Earl said, "Then pray, my
Lords, what is to become of my motion?"  The House burst out
a-laughing: he divided it, but was single.  He then advertised
his papers as lost.  Legge, in his punning style, said, "My
Lord Poulet has had a stroke of an apoplexy; he has lost both
his speech and motion." It is now printed; but not having
succeeded in prose, he is turned poet--you may guess how good!

The Duke(567) is at the head of the Regency-you may guess if
we are afraid! -Both fleets are sailed.  The night the King
went, there was a magnificent ball and supper at Bedford
House.  The Duke was there: he was playing at hazard with a
great heap of gold before him; somebody said, he looked like
the prodigal son and the fatted calf both.  In the dessert was
a model of Walton Bridge in glass.  Yesterday I gave a great
breakfast at Strawberry Hill to the Bedford court.  There were
the Duke and Duchess, Lord Tavistock and Lady Caroline, my
Lord and Lady Gower, Lady Caroline Egerton, Lady Betty
Waldegrave, Lady Mary Coke, Mrs. Pitt,(568) Mr. Churchill and
Lady Mary, Mr. Bap. Leveson,(569) and Colonel Sebright.  The
first thing I asked Harry was, "Does the sun shine?"  It did;
and Strawberry was all gold, and all green.  I am not apt to
think people really like it, that is, understand it--, but I
think the flattery of yesterday was sincere; I judge by the
notice the Duchess took of your drawings.  Oh!  how you will
think the shades of Strawberry extended! Do you observe the
tone of satisfaction with which I say this, as thinking it
near? Mrs. Pitt brought her French horns: we placed them in
the corner of the wood, and it was delightful.  Poyang has
great custom: I have lately given Count Perron some gold fish,
which he has carried in his post-chaise to Turin: he has
already carried some before.  The Russian minister has asked
me for some too, but I doubt their succeeding there; unless,
according to the universality of my system, every thing is to
be found out at last, and practised every where.

I have got a new book that will divert you, called Anecdotes
Litteraires: it is a collection of stories and bons-mots of
all the French writers; but so many of their bons-mots are
impertinences, follies, and vanities, that I have blotted out
the title, and written Mis`eres des S`cavants.  It is a
triumph for the ignorant.  Gray says, very justly, that
learning never should be encouraged, it only draws out fools
from their obscurity; and you know I have always thought a
running footman as meritorious a being as a learned man.  Why
is there more merit in having travelled one's eyes over so
many reams of paper than in having carried one's legs over so
many acres of ground?  Adieu, my dear Sir! Pray don't be taken
prisoner to France, just when you are expected at Strawberry!

(565) Member for the county of Suffolk.  He died in 1759.-E.

(566) "It was," writes Lord Chesterfield to Mr. Dayrolles, on
the 2d of May, "an indecent, ungenerous, and malignant
question, which I had no mind should either be put or debated,
well knowing the absurd and improper things that would be said
both for and against it, and therefore I moved for the House
to adjourn.  As you will imagine that this was agreeable to
the King, it is supposed that I did it to make my court, and
people are impatient to see what great employment I am to
have; for that I am to have one, they do not in the least
doubt, not having any notion that any man can take any step
without some view of dirty interest.  I do not undeceive them.
I have nothing to fear; I have nothing to ask; and there is
nothing that I can or will have."-E.

252 Letter 133
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 13, 1755.

It is very satisfactory to me, to hear that Miss Montagu was
pleased with the day she passed at Strawberry Hill; but does
not it silently reproach you, who will never see it but in
winter?  Does she not assure you that there are leaves, and
flowers, and verdure?  And why will you not believe that with
those additions it might look pretty, and might make you some
small amends for a day or two purloined from Greatworth?  I
wish you would visit it when in its beauty, and while it is
mine! You will not, I flatter Myself, like it so well when it
belongs to the Intendant of Twickenham, when a cockle-shell
walk is made across the lawn, and every thing without doors is
made regular, and every thing riant and modern;--for this must
be its fate! Whether its next master is already on board the
Brest fleet, I do not pretend to say; but I scarce think it
worth my while to dispose of it' by my will, as I have some
apprehensions of living to see it granted away de par le Roy.
My lady Hervey dined there yesterday with the Rochfords.  I
told her, that as she is just going to France, I was unwilling
to let her see it, for if she should like it, she would desire
Mademoiselle with whom she lives, to beg it for her.  Adieu!



252 Letter 134
To George Montagu, Esq.
May 19.

It is on the stroke of eleven, and I have but time to tell
you, that the King of Prussia has gained the greatest
victory(570) that ever was, except the Archangel Michael's-
-King Frederick has only demolished the dragoness.  He
attacked her army in a strong camp on the 6th; suffered in the
beginning of the action much, but took it, with all the tents,
baggage, etc. etc two hundred and fifty pieces of cannon, six
thousand prisoners, and they say, Prague since.  The Austrians
have not stopped yet; if you see any man scamper by your house
you may venture to lay hold on him, though he should be a
Pandour.  Marshal Schwerin was killed.  Good night!

(570) On the banks of the Moldaw near Prague.



253 Letter 135
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, June 10, 1755.

Mr. Muntz(571) is arrived.  I am sorry I can by no means give
any commendation to the hasty step you took about him.  Ten
guineas were a great deal too much to advance to him, and must
raise expectations in him that will not at all answer.  You
have entered into no written engagement with him, nor even
sent me his receipt for the money.  My good Sir, is this the
sample you give me of the prudence and providence you have
learned? I don't love to enter into the particulars of my own
affairs; I will only tell you in one word, that they require
great management.  My endeavours are all employed to serve
you; don't, I beg, give me reasons to apprehend that they will
be thrown away.  It is much in obscurity, whether I shall be
able to accomplish your re-establishment; but I shall go on
with great discouragement, if I cannot promise myself that you
will be a very different person after your return.  I shall
never have it in my power to do twice what I am now doing for
you; and I choose to say the worst beforehand, rather than to
reprove you for indolence and thoughtlessness hereafter, when
it may be too late.  Excuse my being so serious, but I find it
is necessary.

You are not displeased with me, I know, even when I pout: you
see I am not quite in good-humour with you, and I don't
disguise it; but I have done scolding you for this time.
Indeed, I might as well continue it; for I have nothing else
to talk of but Strawberry, and of that subject you must be
well wearied.  I believe she alluded to my disposition to
pout, rather than meant to compliment me, when my Lady
Townshend said to somebody t'other day, who told her how well
Mrs. Leneve was, and in spirits, "Oh! she must be in spirits:
why, she lives with Mr. Walpole, who is spirit of hartshorn!"


Princess Emily has been here:--Liked it?--Oh no!--I don't
wonder; I never liked St. James'-,.  She was so inquisitive
and so curious in prying into the very offices and servants'
rooms, that her Captain Bateman was sensible of it, and begged
Catherine not to mention it.  he addressed himself well, if he
hoped to meet with taciturnity!  Catherine immediately ran
down to the pond, and whispered to all the reeds, "Lord! that
a princess should be such a gossip!"  In short, Strawberry
Hill is the puppet-show of the times.

I have lately bought two more portraits of personages in
Grammont, Harry Jermyn(572) and Chiffinch:(573) my Arlington
Street is so full of portraits, that I shall scarce find room
for Mr. Muntz's works.

Wednesday, 11th.

I was prevented from finishing my letter yesterday, by what do
you think? By no less magnificent a circumstance than a
deluge.  We have had an extraordinary drought, no grass, no
leaves. no flowers; not a white rose for the festival of
yesterday!  About four arrived such a flood, that we could not
see out of the windows: the whole lawn was a lake, though
situated on so high an Ararat: presently it broke through the
leads, drowned the pretty blue bedchamber, passed through
ceilings and floors into the little parlour, terrified Harry,
and opened all Catherine's water-gates and speech-gates.  I
had but just time to collect two dogs, a couple of sheep, a
pair of bantams, and a brace of gold fish; for, in the haste
of my zeal to imitate my ancestor Noah, I forgot that fish
would not easily be drowned.  In short, if you chance to spy a
little ark with pinnacles sailing towards Jersey, open the
skylight, and you will find some of your acquaintance.  You
never saw such desolation! A pigeon brings word that Mabland
has fared still worse: it never came into my head before, that
a rainbow-office for insuring against water might be very
necessary.  This is a true account of the late deluge.
Witness our hands
Horace Noah.
Catherine Noah, her mark.
Harry Shem.
Louis Japhet.
Peter Ham, etc.

I was going to seal my letter, and thought I should scarce
have any thing more important to tell you than the history of
the flood, when a most extraordinary piece of news indeed
arrived--nothing less than a new gunpowder plot-last Monday
was to be the fatal day.  There was a ball at Kew--Vanneschi
and his son, directors of the Opera, two English lords, and
two Scotch lords, are in confinement at Justice Fielding's.
This is exactly all I know of the matter; and this -weighty
intelligence is brought by the waterman from my housemaid in
Arlington Street, who sent Harry word that the town is in an
uproar; and to confirm it, the waterman says he heard the same
thing at Hungerford-stairs.  I took the liberty to represent
to Harry, that the ball at Kew was this day se'nnight for the
Prince's birthday; that, as the Duke was at it, I imagined the
Scotch lords would rather have chosen that day for the
execution of their tragedy; that I believe Vanneschi's son was
a child; and that peers are generally confined at the Tower,
not at Justice Fielding's; besides, that we are much nearer to
Kew than Hungerford-stairs are but Harry, who has not at all
recovered the deluge, is extremely disposed to think Vanneschi
very like Guy Fawkes; and is so persuaded that so dreadful a
story could not be invented, that I have been forced to
believe it too: and in the course of our reasoning and
guessing, I told him, that though I could not fix upon all
four, I was persuaded that the late Lord Lovat who was
beheaded must be one of the Scotch peers, and Lord Anson's son
who is not begot, one of the English.  I was afraid he would
think I treated so serious a business too ludicrously, if I
had hinted at the scene of distressed friendship that would be
occasioned by Lord Hardwicke's examining his intimate
Vanneschi.  Adieu! my dear Sir.  Mr. Fox and Lady Caroline,
and Lord and Lady Kildare, are to dine here to-day; and if
they tell Harry or me any more of the plot you shall know it.

Wednesday night.

Well, now for the plot: thus much is true.  A laundry-maid of
the Duchess of Marlborough, passing by the Cocoa-tree, saw two
gentlemen go in there, one of whom dropped a letter; it was
directed to you.  She opened it.  It was very obscure, talked
of designs at Kew miscarried, of new methods to be taken; and
as this way of correspondence had been repeated too often,
another must be followed: and it told you that the next letter
to him should be in a band-box at such a house in the
Haymarket.  The Duchess concluded it related to a gang of
street-robbers, and sent it to Fielding.  He sent to the house
named, and did find a box and a letter, which, though obscure
had treason enough in it.  It talked of a design at Kew
miscarried; that the Opera was now the only place, and
consequently the scheme must be deferred till next season,
especially as a Certain person is abroad.  For the other great
person (the Duke), they are sure of him at any time.  There
was some indirect mention, too, of gunpowder.  Vanneschi and
others have been apprehended; but a conclusion was made, that
it was a malicious design against the lord high treasurer of
the Opera and his administration, and so they have been
dismissed.  Macnamara,(575) I suppose you Jerseyans know, is
returned with his fleet to Brest, leaving the transports
sailing to America.  Lord Thanet and Mr. Stanley are just gone
to Paris, I believe to inquire after the war.

The weather has been very bad for showing Strawberry to the
Kildares; we have not been able to stir out of doors; but, to
make me amends, I have discovered that Lady Kildare is a true
S`evignist.  You know what pleasure I have in any increase of
our sect; I thought she grew handsomer than ever as she talked
with devotion of Notre Dame des Rochers.  Adieu! my dear Sir.

P. S. Tell me if you receive this; for in these gunpowder
times, to be sure, the clerks of the post-office are
peculiarly alert.

256 Letter 136
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, June 15, 1755.

My dear sir,
I have received your two letters relating to the
Countess,(577) and wish you joy, since she will establish
herself at Florence, that you are so well with her; but I
could not help smiling at the goodness of your heart and your
zeal for us: the moment she spared us, you gave t`ete baiss`ee
into all her histories against Mr. Shirley: his friends say,
that there was a little slight-of-hand in her securing the
absolute possession of her own fortune; it was very prudent,
at least, if not quite sentimental.  You should be at least as
little the dupe of her affection for her son; the only proof
of fondness she has ever given for him, has been expressing
great concern at his wanting taste for Greek and Latin.
Indeed, he has not much encouraged maternal yearnings in her:
I should have thought him shocked at the chronicle of her life
if he ever felt any impressions.  But to speak freely to you,
my dear Sir, he is the most particular young man I ever saw.
No man ever felt such a disposition to love another as I did
to love him: I flattered myself that he would restore some
lustre to our house; at least, not let it totally sink; but I
am forced to give him up, and all my Walpole-views.  I will
describe him to you, if I can, but don't let it pass your
lips.  His figure is charming; he has more of the easy,
genuine air of a man of quality than ever you saw: though he
has a little hesitation in his speech, his address and manner
are the most engaging imaginable: he has a good-breeding and
attention when he is with you that is even flattering; you
think he not only means to please, but designs to do every
thing that shall please you; he promises, offers every thing
one can wish--but this is all; the instant he leaves you, you,
all the world, are nothing to him--he would not give himself
the least trouble in the world to give any body the greatest
satisfaction; yet this is mere indolence of mind, not of
body-his whole pleasure is outrageous exercise.  Every thing
he promises to please you, is to cheat the present moment and
hush any complaint-I mean of words; letters he never answers,
not of business, not of his own business: engagements Of no
sort he ever keeps.  He is the most selfish man in the world,
without being the least interested: he loves nobody but
himself, yet neglects every view of fortune and ambition.  He
has not Only always slighted his mother, but was scarce decent
to his rich old grandmother, when she had not a year to live,
and courted him to receive her favours.  You will ask me what
passions he has--none but of parade; he drinks without
inclination-makes love without inclination--games without
attention; is immeasurably obstinate, yet, like obstinate
people, governed as a child.  In short, it is impossible not
to love him when one sees him; impossible to esteem him when
one thinks on him!

Mr. Chute has found you a very pretty motto: it alludes to the
goats in your arms, and not a little to you; per ardua
stabiles.  All your friends approve it, and it is actually
engraving.  You are not all more in the dark about the war
than we are even here: Macnamara has been returned some time
to Brest with his fleet, having left the transports to be
swallowed up by Boscawen, as we do not doubt but they will be.
Great armaments continue to be making in all the ports of
England and France, and, as we expect next month accounts of
great attempts made by our colonies, we think war unavoidable,
notwithstanding both nations are averse to it.  The French
have certainly overshot themselves; we took it upon a higher
style than they expected, or than has been our custom.  The
spirit and expedition with which we have equipped so
magnificent a navy has surprised them, and does exceeding
honour to my Lord Anson, who has breathed new life into our
affairs.  The minister himself has retained little or none of
his brother's and of his own pusillanimity; and as the
Duke(578) is got into the Regency, you may imagine our
land-spirit will not be unquickened neither.  This is our
situation; actual news there is none.  All we hear from France
is, that a new-madness reigns there, as strong as that of
Pantins was.  This is la fureur des cabriolets; singlic`e,
one-horse chairs, a mode introduced by Mr. Child:(579) they
not only universally go in them, but wear them; that is, every
thing is to be en cabriolet; the men paint them on their
waistcoats, and have them embroidered for clocks to their
stockings; and the women, who have gone all the winter without
any thing on their heads, are now muffled up in great caps
with round sides, in the form of, and scarce less than the
wheels of chaises! Adieu! my dear Sir.

(577) The Countess of Orford.

(578) The Duke of Cumberland.

(579) Josiah Child, brother of the Earl of Tilney.



257 Letter 137
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 5, 1755.

You vex me exceedingly.  I beg, if it is not too late, that
you would not send me these two new quarries of granite; I had
rather pay the original price and leave them where they are,
than be encumbered with them.  My house is already a
stone-cutter's shop, nor do I know what to do with what I have
got.  But this is not what vexes me, but your desiring me to
traffic with Carter, and showing me that you are still open to
any visionary project! Do you think I can turn broker and
factor, and- I don't know what?  And at your time of life, do
you expect to make a fortune by becoming a granite-merchant?
There must be great demand for a commodity that costs a guinea
a foot, and a month an inch to polish! You send me no
drawings, for which you know I should thank you infinitely,
and are hunting for every thing that I would thank you for
letting alone.  In short, my dear Sir, I am determined never
to be a projector, nor to deal with projects.  If you still
pursue them, I must beg you will not only not employ me in
them, but not even let me know that you employ any body else.
If you will not be content with my plain, rational way of
serving you, I can do no better, nor can I joke upon it.  I
can combat any difficulties for your service but those of your
own raising.  Not to talk any more crossly, and to prevent, if
I can, for the future, any more of these expostulations, I
must tell you plainly, that with regard to my own
circumstances.  I generally drive to a penny, and have no
money to spare for visions.  I do and am doing all I can for
you; and let me desire you once for all, not to send me any
more persons or things without asking my consent, and stay
till you receive it.  I cannot help adding to the chapter of
complaint* * * *

These, my dear Sir, are the imprudent difficulties you draw me
into, and which almost discourage me from proceeding in your
business.  If you anticipate your revenue, even while in
Jersey, and build castles in the air before you have repassed
the sea, can I expect that you will be a better economist
either of your fortune or your prudence here? I beg you will
preserve this letter, ungracious as it is, because I hope it
will serve to prevent my writing any more such.

Now to Mr. Muntz;-Hitherto he answers all you promised and
vowed for him: he is very modest, humble, and reasonable; and
has seen so much and knows so much, of countries and languages
that I am not likely to be soon tired of him.  His drawings
are very pretty: he has done two views of Strawberry that
please me extremely; his landscape and trees are much better
than I expected.  His next work is to be a large picture from
your Mr. bland for Mr. Chute, who is much content with him: he
goes to the Vine in a fortnight or three weeks.  We came from
thence the day before yesterday.  I have drawn up an
inventionary of all I propose he should do there; the
computation goes a little beyond five thousand pounds; but he
does not go half so fast as my impatience demands: he is so
reasonable, and will think of dying, and of the gout, and of
twenty disagreeable things that one must do and have, that he
takes no joy in planting and future views, but distresses all
my rapidity of schemes.  last week we were at my sister's at
Chaffont in Buckinghamshire, to see what we could make of it;
but it wants so much of every thing, and would require so much
more than an inventionary of five thousand pounds, that we
decided nothing, except that Mr. Chute has designed the
prettiest house in the world for them.  We Went to See the
objects of the neighbourhood, Bolstrode and Latimers.  The
former is a melancholy monument of Dutch magnificence: however
there is a brave gallery of old pictures, and a chapel with
two fine windows in modern painted glass.  The ceiling was
formerly decorated with the assumption, or rather presumption,
of Chancellor Jeffries, to whom it belonged; but a very
judicious fire hurried him somewhere else; Latimers belongs to
Mrs. Cavendish.  I have lived there formerly with Mr. Conway,
but it is much improved since; yet the river stops short at an
hundred yards just under your eye, and the house has undergone
Batty Langley discipline: half the ornaments are of his
bastard Gothic, and half of Hallet's mongrel Chinese.  I want
to write over the doors of most modern edifices, "Repaired and
beautified; Langley and Hallet churchwardens." The great
dining-room is hung with the paper of my staircase, but not
shaded properly like mine.  I was much more charmed lately at
a visit I made to the Cardigans at Blackheath.  Would you
believe that I had never been in Greenwich Park? I never had,
and am transported! Even the glories of Richmond and
Twickenham hide their diminished rays.  Yet nothing is equal
to the fashion of this village: Mr. Muntz says we have more
coaches than there are in half France.  Mrs. Pritchard has
bought Ragman's Castle, for which my Lord Litchfield could not
agree.  We shall be as celebrated as Baiae or Tivoli; and, if
we have not such sonorous names as they boast, we have very
famous people: Clive and Pritchard, actresses; Scott and
Hudson, painters; my Lady Suffolk, famous in her time; Mr. H *
* *, the impudent lawyer, that Tom Hervey wrote against;
Whitehead, the poet--and Cambridge, the every thing.  Adieu!
my dear Sir--I know not one syllable of news.



259 Letter 138
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, July 16, 1755.

Our correspondence will revive: the war is begun.  I cannot
refer you to the Gazette, for it is so prudent and so afraid
that Europe should say we began first, (and unless the Gazette
tell, how should Europe know?) that it tells nothing at all.
The case was; Captain Howe and Captain Andrews lay in a great
fog that lasted near fifty hours within speech of three French
ships and within sight of nine more.  The commandant asked if
it was war or peace? Howe replied he must wait for his
admiral's signal, but advised the Frenchman to prepare for
war.  Immediately Boscawen gave the signal, and Howe attacked.
The French, who lost one hundred and thirty men to our
thirteen, soon struck; we took one large ship, one
inconsiderable, and seven thousand pounds: the third ship
escaped in the fog.  Boscawen detained the express ten days in
hopes of more success; but the rest of our new enemies are all
got safe into the river of Louisbourg.  This is a great
disappointment! We expect a declaration of war with the first
fair wind.  Make the most of your friendship with Count
lorenzi,(580) while you may.

I have received the cargo of letters and give you many thanks;
but have not seen Mr. Brand; having been in the country while
he was in town.

Your brother has received and sent you a dozen double prints
of my eagle, which I have had engraved.  I could not expect
that any drawing could give you a full idea of the noble
spirit of the head, or of the masterly tumble of the feathers:
but I think Upon the whole the plates are not ill done.  Let
me beg Dr. Cocchi to accept one of each plate; the rest, my
dear Sir, you will give away as you please.

Mr. Chute is such an idle wretch, that you will not wonder I
am his secretary for a commission.  At the Vine is the most
heavenly chapel(581) in the world; it only wants a few
pictures to give it a true Catholic air-we are so conscious of
the goodness of our Protestantism, that we do not care how
things look.  If you can pick us up a tolerable Last Supper,
or can have one copied tolerably and very cheap, we will say
many a mass for the repose of your headaches.  The dimensions
are, three feet eleven inches and three quarters by two feet
eight inches and a half high.  Take notice of two essential
ingredients; it must be cheap, and the colouring must b very
light, for it will hang directly under the window.

I beg YOU Will nurse yourself up to great strength; consider w
what German generals and English commodores you are again
going to have to govern! On my side, not a Pretender

shall land, nor rebellion be committed, but you shall have
timely notice.  Adieu!

(580) A Florentine, but minister of France to the Great Duke.

(581) At Mr. Chute's seat of the Vine, in Hampshire, is a
chapel built by Lord Sandys of the Vine, lord chamberlain to
Henry VIII.  In the painted glass windows, which were taken at
Boulogne in that reign, are portraits of Francis 1. his Queen,
and sister.


260 Letter 139
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 17, 1755.

To be sure, war is a dreadful calamity, etc.! But then it is a
very comfortable commodity for writing letters and writing
history; and as one did not contribute to make it, why there
is no harm in being a little amused with looking on; and if
one can but keep the Pretender on t'other side Derby, and keep
Arlington Street and Strawberry Hill from being carried to
Paris, I know nobody that would do more to promote peace, or
that will bear the want of it, with a better grace than
myself. If I don't send you an actual declaration of war in
this letter, at least you perceive I am the harbinger of it.
An account arrived yesterday morning that Boscawen had missed
the French fleet, who are got into Cape Breton; but two of his
captains(582) attacked three of their squadron and have taken
two, with scarce any loss.  This is the third time one of the
French captains has been taken by Boscawen.

Mr. Conway is arrived from Ireland, where the triumphant party
are what parties in that situation generally are, unreasonable
and presumptuous.  They will come into no terms without a
stipulation that the Primate(583) shall not be in the Regency.
This is a bitter pill to digest, but must not it be swallowed?
Have we heads to manage a French war and an Irish civil war
too?

There are little domestic news.  If you insist upon some, why,
I believe I could persuade somebody or other to hang
themselves; but that is scarce an article uncommon enough to
send cross the sea.  For example, the rich * * * * whose
brother died of the smallpox a year ago, and left him four
hundred thousand Pounds, had a fit of the gout last week, and
shot himself.  I only begin to be afraid that it should grow
as necessary to shoot one's self here, as it is to go into the
army in France.  Sir Robert Browne has lost his last daughter,
to whom he could have given eight thousand pounds a-year.
When I tell these riches and n)adnesses to Mr. Muntz, he
stares so, that I sometimes fear he thinks I mean to impose on
him.  It is cruel to a person who collects the follies of the
age for the information of posterity to have one's veracity
doubted; it is the truth of them that makes them worth notice.
Charles Townshend marries the great dowager Dalkeith;(583 his
parts and presumption are prodigious.  He wanted nothing but
independence to let him loose: I propose great entertainment
from him; and now, perhaps, the times will admit it.  There
may be such things again as parties--odd evolutions happen.
The ballad I am going to transcribe for you is a very good
comment on so commonplace a text.  My Lord Bath, who was
brought hither by my Lady Hervey's and Billy Bristow's reports
of the charms of the place, has made the following stanzas, to
the old tune which you remember of Rowe's ballad on
Doddington's Mrs. Strawbridge:--

"Some talk of Gunnersbury,
For Sion some declare;
And some say that with Chiswick-house
No villa can compare;
But all the beaux of Middlesex,
Who know the country well,
Say, that Strawberry Hill, that Strawberry
Doth bear away the bell.

Though Surry boasts its Oatlands,
And Claremont kept so jim;
And though they talk of Southcote's,
'Tis but a dainty whim;
For ask the gallant Bristow,
Who does in taste excel,
If Strawberry Hill, if Strawberry
Don't bear away the bell."

Can there be an odder revolution of things, than that the
printer of the Craftsman(585) should live in a house of mine,
and that the author of the Craftsman should write a panegyric
on a house of mine?

I dined yesterday at Wanstead many years have passed since I
saw it.  The disposition of the house and the prospect are
better than I expected, and very fine: the garden, which they
tell you cost as much as the house, that is, 100,000 pounds
(don't tell Mr. Muntz) is wretched; the furniture fine, but
totally without taste: such continences and incontinences of
Scipio and Alexander by I don't know whom! such flame-coloured
gods and goddesses, by Kent! such family-pieces, by--I believe
the late Earl himself, for they are as ugly as the children he
really begot! The whole great apartment is of oak, finally
carved, unpainted and has a charming effect(586)  The present
Earl is the most generous creature in the world: in the first
chamber I entered he offered me four marble tables that lay in
cases about the room: I compounded, after forty refusals of
every thing I commended, to bring away only a haunch of
venison: I believe he has not had so cheap a visit a good
while.  I commend myself, as I ought: for, to be sure, there
were twenty ebony chairs, and a couch, and a table, and a
glass, that would have tried the virtue of a philosopher of
double my size! After dinner we dragged a gold-fish pond(587)
for my lady Fitzroy and Lord S@ I could not help telling my
Lord Tilney, that they would certainly burn the poor fish for
the gold, like the old lace.  There arrived a Marquis St.
Simon, from Paris, who understands English, and who has seen
your book of designs for Gray's Odes: he was much pleased at
meeting me, to whom the individual cat(588) belonged, and you
may judge whether I was pleased with him.  Adieu! my dear Sir.

(582) The two captains were the Honourable Captain Richard
Howe of the Dunkirk, and Captain Andrews of the Defiance, who,
on the 10th of June, off Cape Race, the southernmost part of
Newfoundland, fell in with three men-of war, part of the
French fleet, Commanded by M. Bois de la Motte; and, after a
very severe engagement of five Hours, succeeded in capturing
the Alcide of sixty-four guns, and the Lys of sixty-four.- E.

Strawberry Hill.  When he bought the ground on which this
tenement stood, he allowed Franklin to continue to occupy it
during his life.

(586) Arthur Young, in his "Six Weeks' Tour," gives the
following description of Wanstead: "It is one of the noblest
houses in England.  The magnificence of having four state bed-
chambers, with complete apartments to them, and the ball-room,
are superior to any thing of the kind in Houghton, Holkham,
Blenheim and Wilton: but each of these houses is superior to
this in other particulars; and, to form a complete, palace,
something must be taken from all."-E.

(587) Evelyn, who visited Wanstead, March 16, 1682-3, says, "I
went to see Sir Josiah Child's prodigious cost in planting
walnut-trees about his seat, and making fish-ponds many miles
in circuit, in Epping Forest, in a barren spot, as oftentimes
these suddenly moneyed men for the most part. seat themselves.
He, from a merchant's apprentice, and management of the East
India Company's stock, being arrived to an estate ('tis said)
200,000 pounds, and lately married his daughter to the eldest
son of the Duke of Beaufort, late Marquis of Worcester, with
50,000 pounds portional present, and various expectations."

263 Letter 140
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 17, 1755.

Having done with building and planting, I have taken to
farming; the first fruits of my proficience in that science I
offer to you, and have taken the liberty to send you a couple
of cheeses.  If you will give yourself the trouble to inquire
at Brackley for the coach, which set out this morning you will
receive a box and a roll of paper.  The latter does not
contain a cheese, only a receipt for making them.  We have
taken so little of the French fleet, that I fear none of it
will come to my share, or I would have sent you part of the
spoils.  I have nothing more to send you, but a new ballad,
which my Lord Bath has made on this place; you remember the
old burden of it, and the last lines allude to Billy Bristow's
having fallen in love with it.

I am a little pleased to send you this, to show you, that in
summer we are a little pretty, though you will never look at
us but in our ugliness.  My best compliments to Miss Montagu,
and my service to whatever baronet breakfasts with you, on
negus.  Have you heard that poor Lady Browne is so unfortunate
as to have lost her last daughter; and that Mrs. Barnett is so
lucky as to have lost her mother-in-law, and is Baroness Dacre
of the South? I met the great C`u t'other day, and he asked me
if I ever heard from you; that he never did: I told him that I
did not neither; did not I say true?



263 Letter 141
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 26, 1755.

who would not turn farmer, when their very first essay turns
to so good account? Seriously, I am quite pleased with the
success of mystery, and infinitely obliged to you for the kind
things you say about my picture.  You must thank Mrs.
Whetenhall, too, for her prepossession about my cheeses: I
fear a real manufacturer of milk at Strawberry Hill would not
have answered quite so well as our old commodities of paint
and copper-plates.

I am happy for the recovery of Miss Montagu, and the
tranquillity you must feel after so terrible a season of
apprehension.  Make my compliments to her, and if you can be
honest on so tender a topic, tell her, that she will always be
in danger, while you shut her up in Northamptonshire, and that
with her delicate constitution she ought to live nearer
friends and help; and I know of no spot so healthy or
convenient for both, as the county of Twicks.

Charles Townshend is to be married next month: as the lady had
a very bad husband before, she has chosen prudently, and has
settled herself in a family of the best sort of people in the
world, who will think of nothing but making her happy.  I
don't know whether the bridegroom won't be afraid of getting
her any more children, lest it should prejudice those she has
already! they are a wonderful set of people for good-natured
considerations!

You know, to be sure, that Mr. Humberston(589) is dead, and
your neighbouring Brackley likely to return under the dominion
of its old masters.  Lady Dysart(590) is dead too.

Mr. Chute is at the Vine.  Your poor Cliquetis is still a
banished man.  I have a scheme for bringing him back, but can
get Mrs. Tisiphone into no kind of terms, and without tying
her up from running him into new debts, it is in vain to
recover him.

I believe the declaration of war has been stopped at the
Custom-house, for one hears nothing of it.  You see I am very
paragraphical, and in reality have nothing to say; so good
night! Yours ever.

(589)Member for Brackley.-E.

(590) Daughter of the Earl of Granville.



264 Letter 142
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, August 4, 1755, between 11 and 12 at night.

I came from London to-day, and am just come from supping at
Mrs. Clive's, to write to you by the fireside.  We have been
exceedingly troubled for some time with St. Swithin's
diabetes, and have not a dry thread in any walk about us.  I
am not apt to complain of this malady, nor do I: it keeps us
green at present, and will make our shades very thick, against
we are fourscore, and fit to enjoy them.  I brought with me
your two letters of July 30 and August 1st; a sight I have not
seen a long time! But, my dear Sir, you have been hurt at my
late letters.  Do let me say thus much in excuse for myself.
You know how much I value, and what real and great
satisfaction I have in your drawings.  Instead of pleasing me
with so little trouble to yourself, do you think it was no
mortification to receive every thing but your drawings? to
find you full of projects, and, I will not say, with some
imprudences? But I have done on this subject--my friendship
will always be the same for you; it will only act with more or
less cheerfulness, as you use your common sense, or your
disposition to chimerical schemes and carelessness.  To give
you all the present satisfaction in my power, I will tell you
* * * * *

I think your good-nature means to reproach me with having
dropped any hint of finding amusement in contemplating a war.
When one would not do any thing to promote it, when one would
do any thing to put a period to it, when one is too
insignificant to contribute to either, I must own I see no
blame in thinking an active age more agreeable to live in,
than a soporific one.  But, O my dear Sir, I must adopt your
patriotism-Is not it laudable to be revived with the revival
of British glory? Can I be an indifferent spectator of the
triumphs of my country'? Can I help feeling a tattoo at my
heart, when the Duke of Newcastle makes as great a figure in
history as Burleigh or Godolphin-nay, as Queen Bess herself!
She gained no battles in person; she was only the actuating
genius.  You seem to have heard of a proclamation of war, of
which we have not heard; and not to have come to the knowledge
of taking of Beau S`ejour(591) by Colonel Monckton.  In short,
the French and we seem to have crossed over and figured in, in
politics.(592)  Mirepoix complained grievously that the Duke
of Newcastle had overreached him-but he is to be forgiven in
so good a cause!  It is the first person he ever deceived!  I
am preparing a new folio for heads of the heroes that are to
bloom in mezzo-tinto from this war.  At present my chief study
is West Indian history.  You would not think me very
ill-natured if you knew all I feel at the cruelty and villany
of European settlers: but this very morning I found that part
of the purchase of Maryland from the savage proprietors (for
we do not massacre, we are such good Christians as only to
cheat) was a quantity of vermilion and a parcel of Jews-harps!
Indeed, if I pleased, I might have another study; it is my
fault if I am not a commentator and a corrector of the press.
The Marquis de St. Simon, whom I mentioned to you, at a very
first visit proposed to me to look over a translation he had
made of The Tale of a Tub: the proposal was soon followed by a
folio, and a letter of three sides, to press me seriously to
revise it.  You shall judge of my scholar's competence.  He
translates L'Estrange, Dryden, and others, l'`etrange Dryden,
etc.(593)  Then in the description of the tailor as an idol,
and his goose as the symbol; he says in a note, that the goose
means the dove, and is a concealed satire on the Holy Ghost.
It put me in mind of the Dane, who, talking of orders to a
Frenchman, said, "Notre St.  Esprit, est un `el`ephant."

Don't think, because I prefer your drawings to every thing in
the world, that I am such a churl as to refuse Mrs. Bentley's
partridges: I shall thank her very much for them.  You must
excuse me If I am vain enough to be so convinced of my own
taste, that all the neglect that has been thrown upon your
designs cannot make me think I have overvalued them.  I must
think that the states of Jersey who execute your town-house,-
have much more judgment than all our connoisseurs.  When I
every day see Greek, and Roman, and Italian, and Chinese, and
Gothic architecture embroidered and inlaid upon one another,
or called by each other's names, I can't help thinking that
the grace and simplicity and truth of your taste, in whichever
you undertake is real taste.  I go farther: I wish you would
know in what you excel, and not be bunting after twenty things
unworthy your genius.  If flattery is my turn, believe this to
be so.

Mr. Muntz is at the Vine, and has been some time.  I want to
know more of this history of the German: I do assure you, that
I like both his painting and behaviour; but if any history of
any kind is to accompany him, I shall be most willing to part
with him.  However I may divert myself as a spectator of
broils, believe me I am thoroughly sick of having any thing to
do in any.  Those in a neighbouring island are likely to
subside-and, contrary to custom, the priest(594) himself is to
be the sacrifice.

I have contracted a sort of intimacy with Garrick, who is my
neighbour.  He affects to study my taste: I lay it all upon
you--he admires you.  He is building a grateful temple to
Shakspeare: I offered him this motto: "Quod spiro et placeo,
si placeo tuum est!"  Don't be surprised if you should hear of
me as a gentleman come upon the stage next winter for my
diversion.  The truth is, I make the most of this acquaintance
to protect my poor neighbour at Clivden--You understand the
conundrum, Clive's den.

Adieu, my dear Sir! Need I repeat assurances? If I need,
believe that nothing that can tend to your recovery has been
or shall be neglected by me.  You may trust me to the utmost
of my power: beyond that, what can I do? Once more, adieu!

(591) In June, 1755, the French fort of Beau Sejour, in the
Bay of Fundy, surrendered to Colonel Monckton, and two small
forts, Gaspereau and Venango, also capitulated.  These were
the first conquests of the British arms in America during that
war.  He gave the name of Fort Cumberland to Beau S`ejour.-E.

(592) This alludes to England and France not being at open
war, though constantly committing aggressions against each
other.  The capture of these forts formed the first article Of
complaint against England, in the French declaration of war,
in June, 1756.-E.

translation of Pope's Essay on Man.-E.

266 Letter 143
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, August 15, 1755.

My dear sir,
Though I wrote to you so lately, and have certainly nothing
new to tell you, I can't help scribbling a line to YOU
to-night, as I am going to Mr. Rigby's for a week or ten days,
and must thank you first for the three pictures.  One of them
charms me, the Mount Orgueil, which is absolutely fine; the
sea, and shadow upon it, are masterly.  The other two I don't,
at least won't, take for finished.  If you please, Elizabeth
Castle shall be Mr. Muntz's performance: indeed I see nothing
of You in it.  I do reconnoitre you in the Hercules and
Nessus; but in both your colours are dirty, carelessly dirty:
in your distant hills you are improved, and not hard.  The
figures are too large--I don't mean in the Elizabeth Castle,
for there they are neat; but the centaur, though he dies as
well as Garrick can, is outrageous.  Hercules and Deianira are
by no means so: he is sentimental, and she most improperly
sorrowful.  However, I am pleased enough to beg you would
continue.  As soon as Mr. Muntz returns from the Vine, you
shall have a supply of colours.  In the mean time why give up
the good old trade of drawing? Have you no Indian ink, no
soot-water, no snuff, no Coat of onion, no juice of any thing?
If you love me, draw: you would if you knew the real pleasure
you can give me. I have been studying all your drawings; and
next to architecture and trees, I determine that you succeed
in nothing better than animals.  Now (as the newspapers say)
the late ingenious Mr. Seymour is dead, I would recommend
horses and greyhounds to you.  I should think you capable of a
landscape or two with delicious bits of architecture.  I have
known you execute the light of a torch or lanthorn so well,
that if it was called Schalken, a housekeeper at Hampton-court
or Windsor, or a Catherine at Strawberry Hill, would show it,
and say it cost ten thousand pounds.  Nay, if I could believe
that you would ever execute any more designs I proposed to
you, I would give you a hint for a picture that struck me
t'other day in P`er`efixe's Life of Henry IV.(595)  He says,
the king was often seen lying upon a common straw-bed among
the soldiers, with a piece of brown bread in one hand, and a
bit of charcoal in t'other, to draw an encampment, or town
that he was besieging.  If this is not a character and a
picture, I don't know what is.

I dined to-day at Garrick's: there were the Duke of Grafton,
Lord and Lady Rochford, Lady Holderness, the crooked Mostyn,
and Dabreu the Spanish minister; two regents, of which one is
lord chamberlain, the other groom of the stole; and the wife
of a secretary of state.  This is the being sur un assez bon
ton for a player!  Don't you want to ask me how I like him? Do
want, and I will tell you.  I like her exceedingly; her
behaviour is all sense, and all sweetness too.  I don't know
how, he does not improve so fast upon me: there is a great
deal of parts, and vivacity, and variety, but there is a great
deal too of mimicry and burlesque.  I am very ungrateful, for
he flatters me abundantly; but unluckily I know it.  I was
accustomed to it enough when my father was first minister: on
his fall I lost it all at once: and since that, I have lived
with Mr. Chute, who is all vehemence; with Mr. Fox, who is all
disputation; with Sir Charles Williams, who has no time from
flattering himself; with Gray, who does not hate to find fault
with me; with Mr. Conway, who is all sincerity; and with you
and Mr. Rigby, who have always laughed at me in a good-natured
way.  I don't know how, but I think I like all this as well--I
beg his pardon, Mr. Raftor does flatter me; but I should be a
cormorant for praise, if I could swallow it whole as he gives
it me.

Sir William Yonge, who has been extinct so long is at last
dead and the war, which began with such a flirt of vivacity,
is I think gone to sleep.  General Braddock has not yet sent
over to claim the surname of Americanus.  But why should I
take pains to show You in how many ways I know nothing?--Why;
I can tell it you in one word--why, Mr. Cambridge knows
nothing!--I wish you good-night!  Yours ever.

(595) Hardouin de P`er`efixe's Histoire du Roi Henri le Grand
appeared in 1661.  He is stated, by the editor Of the Biog.
Univ. to be the best historian of that monarch, and the work
has been translated in many languages.  He was appointed
preceptor to Louis XIV. in 1644, and Archbishop of Paris in
1622.  He died in 1670.-E.



268 Letter 144
To Sir Horace Mann.
Mistley, August 21, 1755.                              '

I shall laugh at you for taking so seriously what I said to
you about my Lady Orford.  Do you think, my dear Sir, that at
this time I can want to learn your zeal for us? or can you
imagine that I did not approve for your own sake your keeping
fair terms with the Countess?  If I do not much forget, I even
recommended it to you--but let us talk no more of her; she has
engrossed more paragraphs in our letters than she deserves.

I promised you a brisk war: we have done our part, but can I
help it, if the French will not declare it?-if they are
backward, and cautious, and timorous; if they are afraid of
provoking too far SO great a power as England, who threatens
the liberties of Europe?  I laugh, but how not to laugh at
such a world as this! Do you remember the language of the last
war? What were our apprehensions? Nay, at the conclusion of
the peace, nothing was laid down for a maxim but the
impossibility of our engaging in another war; that our
national debt was at its ne plus ultra; and that on the very
next discussion France must swallow us up! Now we are all
insolent, alert, and triumphant: nay the French talk of
nothing but guarding against our piracies, and travel Europe
to give the alarm against such an overbearing power as we are.
On their coasts they are alarmed--I mean the common people; I
scarce believe they who know any thing, are in real dread of
invasion from us! Whatever be the reason, they don't declare
war: some think they wait for the arrival of their Martinico
fleet.  You will ask why we should not attack that too?  They
tell one, that if we began hostilities in Europe, Spain would
join the French.  Some believe that the latter are not ready:
certain it is, Mirepoix gave them no notice nor suspicion of
our flippancy; and he is rather under a cloud--indeed this has
much undeceived me in one point: I took him for the ostensible
mister; but little thought that they had not some secret agent
of better head, some priest, some Scotch or Irish Papist-or
perhaps some English Protestant, to give them better
intelligence.  But don't you begin to be impatient for the
events of all our West Indian expeditions?  The Duke,(596) who
is now the soul of the Regency, and who on all hands is
allowed to make a great figure there, is much dissatisfied at
the slowness of General Braddock, who does not march as if he
was at all impatient to be scalped.  It is said for him, that
he has had bad guides, that the roads are exceedingly
difficult, and that it was necessary to drag as much artillery
as he does.  This is not the first time, as witness in
Hawley,(597) that the Duke has found that brutality did not
necessarily consummate a general.  I love to give you an idea
of our characters as they rise upon the stage of history.
Braddock is a very Iroquois in disposition.  He had a sister,
who having gamed away all her little fortune at Bath, hanged
herself(598) with a truly English deliberation, leaving only a
note upon the table with those lines "To die is landing on
some silent shore," etc.  When Braddock was told of it, he
only said, "Poor Fanny! I always thought she would play till
she would be forced to tuck herself up!"' But a more
ridiculous story of him, and which is recorded in heroics by
Fielding in his Covent-Garden tragedy, was an amorous
discussion he had formerly with a Mrs. Upton, who had kept
him.  He had gone the greatest lengths with her pin-money, and
was still craving.  One day that he was very pressing, she
pulled out her purse and showed him that she had but twelve or
fourteen shillings left; he twitched it from her, "Let me see
that."  Tied up at the other end he found five guineas; he
took them, tossed the empty purse in her face, saying, "Did
you mean to cheat me?" and never went near her more:--now you
are acquainted with General Braddock.

We have some royal negotiations proceeding in Germany, which
are not likely to give quite so much satisfaction to the
Parliament of next winter, as our French triumphs give to the
City, where nothing is so popular as the Duke of Newcastle.
There is a certain Hessian treaty, said to be eighteen years
long, which is arrived at the Treasury, Legge refused
peremptorily to sign it--you did not expect patriotism from
thence? It will not make him popular: there is not a mob in
England now capable of being the dupe of patriotism; the late
body of that denomination have really so discredited it, that
a minister must go great lengths indeed before the people
would dread him half so much as a patriot! On the contrary, I
believe nothing would make any man so popular, or conciliate
so much affection to his ministry, as to assure the people
that he never had nor ever would pretend to love his country.
Legge has been frowned upon by the Duke of Newcastle ever
since he was made chancellor of the exchequer by him, and
would have been turned out long ago if Sir George Lee would
have accepted the post.  I am sorry that just when Tuscany is
at war with Algiers, your countrymen should lie under the
odour of piracy too; it will give Richcourt opportunities of
saying very severe things to you!--Barbarossa our Dey is not
returned yet-we fear he is going to set his grandson(599) up
in a seraglio; and as we have not, among other Mahometan
customs, copied the use of the bowstring for repressing the
luxuriancy of the royal branches, we shall be quite overrun
with young Sultans!  Adieu!

brutality in the Scotch rebellion, which did not however

270 Letter 145
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, August 28, 1755.

My last letter to you could not be got out of England, before
I might have added a melancholy supplement.  Accounts of a
total defeat of Braddock, and his forces are arrived from
America; the purport is, that the General having arrived
within a few miles of Fort du Quesne, (I hope you are perfect
in your American geography?) sent an advanced party, under
Lord Gage's brother: they were fired upon, invisibly, as they
entered a wood; Braddock heard guns, and sent another party to
support the former; but the first fell back in confusion on
the second, and the second on the main body.  The whole was in
disorder, and it is said, the General himself', though
exceedingly brave, did not retain all the sang froid that was
necessary.  The common soldiers in general, fled; the officers
stood heroically and were massacred: our Indians were not
surprised, and behaved gallantly.  The General had five horses
shot under him, no bad symptoms of his spirit, and at last was
brought off by two Americans, no English daring, though
Captain Orme,(600) his aid-de-camp, who is wounded too, and
has made some noise here by an affair of gallantry, offered
Sixty guineas to have him conveyed away.  We have lost
twenty-six officers, besides many wounded, and ten pieces of
artillery.  Braddock lived four days, in great torment.(601)
What makes the rout more shameful is, that instead of a great
pursuit, and a barbarous massacre by the Indians, which is
always to be feared in these rencontres, not a black or white
soul followed our troops, but we had leisure two days
afterwards to fetch off our dead.  In short, our American
laurels are strangely blighted! We intended to be in great
alarms for Carolina and Virginia, but the small number of our
enemies had reduced this affair to a panic.  We pretend to be
comforted on the French deserting Fort St. John, and on the
hopes we have from two other expeditions which are on foot in
that part of the world-but it is a great drawback on English
heroism I pity you who represent the very flower of British
courage ingrafted on a Brunswick stock!

I have already given you some account of Braddock; I may
complete the poor man's history in a few more words: he once
had a duel with Colonel Gumley, Lady Bath's(602) brother, who
had been his great friend: as they were going to engage,
Gumley, who had good humour and wit, (Braddock had the
latter,) said "Braddock, you are a poor dog! here take my
purse; if you kill me you will be forced to run away, and then
you will not have a shilling to support you." Braddock refused
the purse, insisted on' the duel, was disarmed, and would not
even ask his life. However, with all his brutality, he has
lately been Governor of Gibraltar, where he made himself
adored, and where scarce any Governor was endured before.
Adieu! Pray don't let any detachment from Pannoni's(603) be
sent against us--we should run away!

(600) He married the sister of George Lord Townshend, without
the consent of her family.

(601) Walpole, in his Memoires, says, that "he dictated an
encomium on his officers, and expired."-D.

famous for their courage of late.



271 Letter 146
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, August 28, 1755.

Our piratic laurels, with which the French have so much
reproached us, have been exceedingly pruned! Braddock is
defeated and killed, by a handful of Indians and by the
baseness of his own troops, who sacrificed him and his gallant
officers.  Indeed, there is some suspicion that cowardice was
not the motive, but resentment at having been draughted from
Irish regiments.  Were such a desertion universal, could one
but commend@it'@ Could one blame men who should refuse to be
knocked on the head for sixpence a day, and for the advantage
and dignity of a few ambitious? But in this case one pities
the brave young @officers, who cannot so easily disfranchise
themselves from the prejudices of glory!  Our disappointment
is greater than our loss; six-and-twenty officers are killed,
who, I suppose, have not left a vast many fatherless and
widowless, as an old woman told me to-day with great
tribulation.  The ministry have a much more serious affair on
their hands-Lord Lincoln and Lord Anson have had a dreadful
quarrel! Coquus teterrima belli causa!  When Lord Mountford
shot himself, Lord Lincoln said, "Well, I am very sorry for
poor Mountford! but it is the part of a wise man to make the
best of every misfortune-I shall now have the best cook in
England."  This was uttered before Lord Anson.  Joras,(604)--
who is a man of extreme punctilio, as cooks and officers ought
to be, would not be hired till he knew whether this Lord
Mountford would retain him.  When it was decided that he would
not, Lord Lincoln proposed to hire Joras.  Anson had already
engaged him.  Such a breach of friendship was soon followed by
an expostulation (there was jealousy of the Duke of
Newcastle's favour already under the coals): in short the
nephew earl called the favourite earl such gross names, that
it was well they were ministers!  otherwise, as Mincing says,
"I vow, I believe they must have fit."  The public, that is
half-a-dozen toad-eaters, have great hopes that the present
unfavourable posture of affairs in America will tend to cement
this breach, and that we shall all unite hand and heart
against the common enemy.

I returned the night before last from my peregrination.  It is
very unlucky for me that no crown of martyrdom is entailed on
zeal for antiquities; I should be a rubric martyr of the first
class.  After visiting the new salt-water baths at Harwich,
(which, next to horse-racing, grows the most fashionable
resource for people who want to get out of town, and who love
the country and retirement!) I went to see Orford castle, and
Lord Hertford's at Sudborn.  The one is a ruin, and the other
ought to be so.  Returning in a one-horse chair over a wild
vast heath, I went out of the road to see the remains of
Buttley Abbey; which however I could not see; for, as the keys
of Orford castle were at Sudborn, so the keys of Buttley were
at Orford! By this time it was night; we lost our way, were in
excessive rain for above two hours, and only found our way to
be overturned into the mire the next morning going into
Ipswich.  Since that I went to see an old house built by
Secretary Naunton.(605)  His descendant, who is a strange
retired creature, was unwilling to let us see it; but we did,
and little in it worth seeing.  The house never was fine, and
is now out of repair; has a bed with ivory pillars and loose
rings, presented to the secretary by some German prince or
German artist; and a small gallery of indifferent portraits,
among which there are scarce any worth notice but of the Earl
of Northumberland, Anna Bullen's lover, and of Sir Antony
Wingfield, who having his hand tucked into his girdle, the
housekeeper told us, had had his fingers cut off by Harry
VIII.  But Harry VIII. was not a man pour s'arr`eter `a ces
minuties la!

While we waited for leave to see the house, I strolled into
the churchyard, and was struck with a little door open into
the chancel, through the arch of which I discovered
cross-legged knights and painted tombs!  In short, there are
no less than eight considerable monuments, very perfect, of
Wingfields, Nauntons, and a Sir John Boynet and his wife, as
old as Richard the Second's time.  But what charmed me still
more, were two figures of Secretary Naunton's father and
mother in the window in painted glass, near two feet high, and
by far the finest painting on glass I ever saw.  His figure,
in a puffed doublet, breeches and bonnet, and cloak of scarlet
and yellow, is absolutely perfect: her shoulder is damaged.
This church, which is scarce bigger than a large chapel, is
very ruinous, though containing such treasures!  Besides
these, there are brasses on the pavement, with a succession of
all the wonderful head-dresses which our plain virtuous
grandmothers invented to tempt our rude and simple ancestors.-
-I don't know what our nobles might be, but I am sure that
Milliners three or four hundred years ago must have been more
accomplished in the arts, as Prynne calls them, of crisping,
curling, frizzling, and frouncing, than all the tirewomen of
Babylon, modern Paris, or modern Pall-Mall.  Dame Winifred
Boynet, whom I mentioned above, is accoutered with the
coiffure called piked horns, which, if there were any signs in
Lothbury and Eastcheap, must have brushed them about
strangely, as their ladyships rode behind their gentlemen
ushers! Adieu!

273 Letter 147
To The Rev. Henry Etough.(606)
Woolterton, Sept. 10, 1755.

Dear Etough,
I cannot forbear any longer to acknowledge the many favours
from you lately; your last was the 8th of this month. His
Majesty's speedy arrival among his British subjects is very
desirable and necessary, whatever may be the chief motive for
his making haste.  As to Spain, I have from the beginning told
my friends, when they asked, both in town and country, that I
was at all apprehensive that Spain would join with France
against us; for this plain reason, because it could not
possibly be the interest of the Spaniards to do it for should
the views of the French take place in making a line of forts
from the Mississippi to Canada, and of being masters of the
whole of that extent of country, Peru and Mexico, and Florida,
would be in more danger from them than the British settlements
in America.

Mr. Fowle has made me a visit for a few days, and communicated
to me your two pieces relating to my brother and Lord
Bolingbroke, and I think you do great justice to them both in
their very different and opposite characters; but you will
give me leave to add with respect to Lord Orford, there are
several mistakes and misinformations, of which I am persuaded
I could convince you by conversation, but my observations are
not proper for a letter.  Of this more fully when I see you,
but when that will be I can't yet tell.  I am ever most
affectionately yours, etc.

(606) The Rev.  Henry Etough, of Pembroke-hall, Cambridge.  He
received his education among the Dissenters, and Archbishop
Secker and Dr. 'Birch were among his schoolfellows.  Through
the interest of Sir Robert Walpole, he was presented to the
rectory of Therfield, in Hertfordshire; where he died, in his
seventieth year, in August 1757.-E.



273 Letter 148
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, September 18, 1755.

My dear sir,
After an expectation of six weeks, I have received a letter
from you, dated August 23d.  Indeed I did not impute any
neglect to you; I knew it arose from the war; but Mr. S. * * *
* tells me the packets will now be more regular.--Mr. S * * *
tells me!--What, has he been in town, or at Strawberry?--No;
but I have been at Southampton: I was at the Vine; and on the
arrival of a few fine days, the first we have had this summer,
after a deluge, Mr. Chute persuaded me to take a jaunt to
Winchester and Netley Abbey, with the latter of which he is
very justly enchanted.  I was disappointed in Winchester: it
is a paltry town, and small: King Charles the Second's house
is the worst thing I ever saw of Sir Christopher Wren, a
mixture of a town-hall and an hospital; not to mention the bad
choice of the situation in such a country; it is all ups that
should be downs.  I talk to you as supposing that you never
have been at Winchester, though I suspect you have, for the
entrance of the cathedral is the very idea of that of Mabland.
I like the smugness of the cathedral, and the profusion of the
most beautiful Gothic tombs.  That of Cardinal Beaufort is in
a style more free and of more taste than any thing I have seen
of the kind.  His figure confirms me in my opinion that I have
struck out the true history of the picture that I bought of
Robinson; and which I take for the marriage of Henry VI.
Besides the monuments of the Saxon Kings, of Lucius, William
Rufus, his brother, etc. there are those of six such great or
considerable men as Beaufort, William of Wickham, him of
Wainfleet, the Bishops Fox and Gardiner, and my Lord Treasurer
Portland.--How much power and ambition under half-a-dozen
stones! I own, I grow to look on tombs as lasting mansions,
instead of observing them for curious pieces of architecture!-
-Going into Southampton, I passed Bevismount, where my Lord
Peterborough

"Hung his trophies o'er his garden gate;"(607)

but General Mordaunt was there, and we could not see it.  We
walked long by moonlight on the terrace along the beach-
-Guess, if we talked of and wished for you! The town is
crowded; sea-baths are established there too.  But how shall I
describe Netley to you?  I can only by telling YOU, that it is
the spot in the world for which Mr. Chute and I wish.  The
ruins are vast, and retain fragments of beautiful fretted
roofs pendent in the air, With all variety of Gothic patterns
of windows wrapped round and round with ivy-many trees are
sprouted up amongst the walls, and Only want to be increased
with cypresses! A hill rises above the abbey encircled with
wood: the fort, in which we would build a tower for
habitation, remains with two small platforms.  This little
castle is buried from the abbey in a wood, in the very centre,
on the edge of the hill: on each side breaks in the view of
the Southampton sea, deep blue, glistering with silver and
vessels; on one side terminated by Southampton, on the other
by Calshot castle; and the Isle of Wight rising above the
opposite hills.  In short, they are not the ruins of Netley,
but of Paradise.--OH! the purple abbots, what a spot had they
chosen to slumber in! The scene is so beautifully tranquil,
that they seem only to have retired into the world.(608)

I know nothing of the war, but that we catch little French
ships like crawfish.  They have taken one of ours with
Governor Lyttelton(609) going to South Carolina.  He is a very
worthy young man, but so stiffened with Sir George's old
fustian, that I am persuaded he is at this minute in the
citadel of Nantes comparing himself to Regulus.

Gray has lately been here.  He has begun an Ode,(610) which if
he finishes equally, will, I think, inspirit all your drawing
again.  It is founded on an old tradition of Edward 1. putting
to death the Welsh bards.  Nothing but you, or Salvator Rosa,
and Nicolo Poussin, can paint up to the expressive horror and
dignity of it.  Don't think I mean to flatter you; all I would
say is, that now the two latter are dead, you must of
necessity be Gray's painter.  In order to keep your talent
alive, I shall next week send you flake white, brushes, oil,
and the enclosed directions from Mr. Muntz, who is still at
the Vine, and whom, for want of you, we labour hard to form.
I shall put up in the parcel two or three prints of my eagle,
which, as you never would draw it, is very moderately
performed; and yet the drawing was much better than the
engraving.  I shall send you too a trifling snuff-box, only as
a sample of the new manufacture at Battersea, which is done
with copper-plates.  Mr. Chute is at the Vine, where I cannot
say any works go on in proportion to my impatience.  I have
left him an inventionary of all I want to have done there; but
I believe it may be bound up with the century of projects of
that foolish Marquis of Worcester, who printed a catalogue of
titles of things which he gave no directions to execute, nor I
believe could.(611)  Adieu!

(607) "Our Gen'rals now, retired to their estate,
Hang their old trophies o'er the garden gate."
Pope, in this couplet, is said to have alluded to the entrance

time left unfinished; but the accident of seeing a blind

275 Letter 149
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 23, 1755.

Dear harry,
Never make me excuses for a letter that tells me so many
agreeable things -as your last; that you are got well to
Dublin;(612) that you are all well, and that you have
accommodated all your politics to your satisfaction--and I may
be allowed to say, greatly to your credit 'What could you tell
me that would please me so much When I have indulged a little
my joy for your success and honour, it is natural to consider
the circumstances you have told me; and you will easily excuse
me if I am not quite as much satisfied with the conduct of
your late antagonists, as I with yours.  You have
tranquillized a nation, have repaired your master's honour,
and secured the peace of your administration;-but what shall
one say to the Speaker, Mr. Malone and the others? Don't they
confess that they have gone the greatest lengths, and risked
the safety of their country on a mere personal pique? If they
did not contend for profit, like our patriots (and you don't
tell me that they have made any lucrative stipulations), yet
it is plain that their ambition had been wounded, and that
they resented their power being crossed.  But I, Who am Whig
to the backbone, indeed in the strictest sense of the word,
feel hurt in a tenderer point, and which you,. who are a
minister, must not allow me: I am offended at their agreeing
to an address that avows such deference for prerogative, and
that is to protest so deeply against having to attack it.
However rebel this may sound at your court, my Gothic spirit
is hurt; I do not love such loyal expressions from a
Parliament.  I do not so much consider myself writing to
Dublin castle, as from Strawberry castle, where you know how I
love to enjoy my liberty.  I give myself the airs, in my
nutshell, of an old baron, and am tempted almost to say with
an old Earl of Norfolk, who was a very free speaker at least,
if he was not an excellent poet,

"When I am in my castle of Bungey,
Situate upon the river Waveney,
I ne care for the King of cockney."

I have been roving about Hampshire, have been at Winchester
and Southampton and twenty places, and have been but one day
in London --consequently know as little news as if I had been
shut up in Bungey castle.  Rumours there are of great
bickerings and uneasiness; but I don't believe there will be
any bloodshed of places, except Legge's, which nobody seems
willing to take-I mean as a sinecure.  His Majesty of Cockney
is returned exceedingly well, but grown a little out of humour
at finding that we are not so much pleased with all the
Russians and Hessians that he has hired to recover the Ohio.
We are an ungrateful people!  Make a great many compliments
for me to my Lady Ailesbury; I own I am in pain about Missy.
As my lady is a little coquette herself, and loves crowds and
admiration, and a court life, it will be very difficult for
her to keep a strict eye upon Missy.  The Irish are very
forward and bold:--I say no more but it would hurt you both
extremely to have her marry herself idly and I think my Lord
Chancellor has not extended his matrimonial foresight to
Ireland.  However, I have much confidence in Mrs. Elizabeth
Jones:(613) I am sure, when they were here, she would never
let Missy whisper with a boy that was old enough to speak.
Adieu! As the winter advances, and plots thicken, I will write
you letters that shall have a little more in them than this.
In the mean time I am going to Bath, not for my health, you
know I never am ill, but for my amusement.  I never was there,
and at present there are several of my acquaintance.  The
French academy have chosen my Lord Chesterfield, and he has
written them a letter of thanks. that is the finest
composition in the world - indeed, I was told so by those who
have not seen it; but they would have told me so if they had
seen it, whether it was the finest or the worst; suffices it
to be his!  Yours ever.

(612) mr. Conway was now secretary of state to the Marquis of
Hartington, lord lieutenant of Ireland.

277 Letter 150
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Sept. 29, 1755.

It is not that I am perjured for not writing to you oftener,
as I promised; the war is forsworn.  We do all we can; we
take, from men-of-war and Domingo-men, down to colliers and
cock-boats, and from California into the very Bay of Calais.
The French have taken but one ship from us, the Blandford, and
that they have restored--but I don't like this drowsy civil
lion; it will put out a talon and give us a cursed scratch
before we are aware.  Monsieur de seychelles, who grows into
power, is labouring at their finances and marine: they have
struck off their sous-fermiers, and by a reform in what they
call the King's pleasures, have already saved 1,200,000 pounds
sterling a year.  Don't go and imagine that 1,200,000 pounds
was all stink in the gulf of Madame Pompadour, or even in
suppers and hunting; under the word the King's pleasures, they
really comprehended his civil list; and in that light I don't
know why our civil list might not be called another King's
pleasures(614) too, though it is not all entirely squandered.
In short, the single article of coffee for the Mesdames(615)
amounted to 3000 pounds sterling a year--to what must their
rouge have amounted?--but it is high time to tell you of other
wars, than the old story of France and England.  You must
know, not in your ministerial capacity, for I suppose that is
directed by such old geographers as Sanson and De Lisle, who
imagined that Herenhausen was a town in Germany, but according
to the latest discoveries, there is such a county in England
as Hanover, which lying very much exposed to the incursions of
the French and Prussians (the latter are certain hussars in
the French army), it has been thought necessary to hire
Russians, and Hessians, and all the troops that lie nearest to
the aforesaid weak part of Great Britain called Hanover, in
order to cover this frontier from any invasion.  The
expedience of this measure was obvious; yet many People who
could not get over the prejudice of education, or who having
got over these prejudices have for certain reasons returned to
them, these Ptolemaic geographers Will not be persuaded that
there is any such county in England as Hanover, and not
finding it in their old maps, or having burnt their new ones
in a passion--(Mr.  Legge, indeed, tore his at the treasury
board the day that the warrant for the Hessian subsidy came
thither)--they determined that England had no occasion for
these mercenaries.  Besides Legge, the Duke of Devonshire, the
Speaker, Sir George Lee, and one MR. William Pitt, a man
formerly remarkable for disputing the new geography, declared
strongly against the system of treaties.(616) Copernicus no
sooner returned from Germany, than the Duke of Newcastle, who
had taken the alarm, frightened him out of his wits.  In
short, they found that they should have no Professor to defend
the new system in Parliament.  Every body was tried--when
every body had refused, and the Duke of Newcastle was ready to
throw up the cards, he determined to try Fox,(617) who, by the
mediation of Lord Granville, has accepted the seals, is to be
secretary of state, is to have the conduct of the House of
Commons, and is, I think-very soon to be first minister-or
what one has known to happen to some who of very late years
have joined to support a tottering administration, is to be
ruined.  Indeed, he seems sensible of the alternative,
professes no cordiality to Duke Trinculo, who is viceroy over
him, but is listing Bedford's, and whoever will list with him,
as fast as he can.  One who has been his predecessor in
suffering by such an alliance, my Lord Chesterfield, told him,
"Well, the Duke of Newcastle has turned out every body else,
and now he has turned out himself."  Sir Thomas Robinson is to
return to the great wardrobe, with an additional pension on
Ireland of 2000 pounds a year.  This is turning a cipher into
figures indeed!  Lord Barrington is to be secretary at war.
This change, however, is not to take place till after the
Parliament is met, which is not till the 13th of' next month,
because Mr. Fox is to preside at the Cockpit the night before
the House opens.  How Mr. Legge will take his deposition is
not known.  He has determined not to resign, but to be turned
out; I should think this would satisfy his scruples, even if
he had made a vow against resigning.

As England grows turbulent again, Ireland grows calm again.
Mr. Conway, who has gone thither secretary to Lord Hartington,
has with great prudence and skill pacified that kingdom: you
may imagine that I am not a little happy at his acquiring
renown.  The Primate is to be the peace-offering.

If there were any private news, as there are none, I could not
possibly to-day step out of my high historical pantoufles to
tell it you.  Adieu! You know I don't dislike to see the Kings
and queens and Knaves of this world shuffled backwards and
forwards; consequently I look on, very well amused, and very
indifferent whatever is trumps!

(614) Alluding to the King's love of money.

(615 The daughters of Louis the Fifteenth.-D.

(616) The following is from Dodington's Diary:-"Sept. 3. Mr.
Pitt told me, that he had painted to the Duke of Newcastle all
the ill Consequences of this system of subsidies in the
strongest light that his imagination could furnish him with:
he had deprecated his Grace not to complete the ruin which the
King had nearly brought upon himself by his journey to
Hanover, which all people should have prevented, even with
their bodies.  A King abroad, at this time, without one man
about him that has one English sentiment, and to bring home a
whole set of subsidies!  That he was willing to promote the
King's service; but if this was what he was sent for to
promote, few words were best--nothing in the world should
induce him to consent to these subsidies."-E.

(617) " Fox must again be treated with; for the session of
Parliament approached, and it was become a general maxim, that
the House of Commons had been so much accustomed to have a
minister of its own, they would not any longer be governed by
deputy.  Fox insisted on being made secretary of state, much
against the King's inclination, as well as the Duke of
Newcastle's: for though his Majesty preferred Fox to Pitt, he
liked Sir Thomas Robinson better than either of them; for Sir
Thomas did -is he was directed, understood foreign affairs,
and pretended to nothing further.  However, Fox carried his
point." Waldegrave's Memoirs, p. 51.-E.

I should not answer your letter so soon, as you write so
often, if I had not something particular to tell you.  Mr. Fox
is to be secretary of state.  The history of this event, in
short, is this: George Elector of Hanover, and Thomas King of
England, have been exceedingly alarmed.  By some
misapprehension, the Russian and Hessian treaties, the
greatest blessings that were ever calculated for this country,
have been totally, and almost universally disapproved.  Mr.
Legge grew conscientious about them; the Speaker,
constitutional; Mr. Pitt, patriot; Sir George Lee. scrupulous;
Lord Egmont, uncertain; the Duke of Devonshire, something that
he meant for some of these; and my uncle, I suppose, frugal--
how you know.  Let a Parliament be ever so ready to vote for
any thing, yet if every body in both Houses is against a
thing, why the Parliament itself can't carry a point against
both Houses.  This made such a dilemma, that, after trying
every body else, and being ready to fling up themselves, King
Thomas and his Chancellor offered Mr. Fox the honour of
defending and saving them.  He, who is all Christian charity,
and forgiving every body but himself and those who dissuaded
him, for not taking the seals before, consented to undertake
the cause of the treaties, and is to have the management of
the House Of Commons as long as he can keep it.  In the mean
time, to give his new friends all the assistance he can, he is
endeavouring to bring the Bedfords to court; and if any other
person in the world hates King Thomas, why Mr. Fox is very
willing to bring them to court too.  In the mean time, Mr.
Pitt is scouring his old Hanoverian trumpet and Mr. Legge is
to accompany him with his hurdy-gurdy.

Mr. Mann did not tell me a word of his intending you a visit.
The reason the Dacres have not been with you is, they have
been at court; and as at present there are as many royal hands
to kiss as a Japanese idol has, it takes some time to slobber
through the whole ceremony.

I have some thoughts of going to Bath for a week; though I
don't know whether my love for my country, while my country is
in a quandary, may not detain me hereabouts.  When Mr. Muntz
has done, you will be so good as to pacquet him up, and send
him to Strawberry.  I rather wish you would bring him
yourself; I am impatient for the drawing you announce to me.
A commission has passed the seals, I mean of' secrecy, (for I
don't know whether they must not be stole,) to get you some
swans; and as in this age one ought not to despair of any
thing where robbery is concerned, I have some hopes of
succeeding.  If you should want any French ships for your
water, there are great numbers to be had cheap, and small
enough.  Adieu!

280 Letter 152
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, Sept. 30, 1755.

Solomon says somewhere or other, I think it is in
Castelnuovo's edition--is not there such a one?--that the
infatuation of a nation for a foolish minister is like that of
a lover for an ugly woman: when once he opens his eyes, he
wonders what the devil bewitched him.  This is the text to the
present sermon in politics, which I shall not divide under
three heads, but tell you at once, that no minister was ever
nearer the precipice than ours has been.  I did tell you, I
believe, that Legge had refused to sign the warrant for the
Hessian subsidy: in short, he heartily resented the quick
coldness that followed his exaltation, waited for an
opportunity of revenge, found this; and, to be sure, no
vengeance ever took speedier strides.  All the world revolted
against subsidiary treaties; nobody was left to defend them
but Murray, and he did not care to venture.  Offers of
graciousness, of cabinet councillor, or chancellor of the
exchequer, were made to right and left.  Dr. Lee was
conscientious; Mr. Pitt might be brought, in compliment to his
Majesty, to digest one--but a system of subsidies--impossible!
In short, the very first ministership was offered to be made
over to my Lord Granville. He begged to be excused--he was not
fit for it.  Well, you laugh--all this is fact.  At last we
were forced to strike sail to Mr. Fox he is named for
secretary of state, with not only the lead, but the power of
the House of Commons.  You ask, in the room of which
secretary? What signifies of which? Why, I think, of Sir
Thomas Robinson, who returns to his wardrobe; and Lord
Barrington comes into the war-office.  This is the present
state of things in this grave reasonable island: the union hug
like two cats over a string; the rest are arming for
opposition.  But I Will not promise you any more warlike
winters; I remember how soon the campaign of the list was
addled.

In Ireland, Mr. Conway has pacified all things: the Irish are
to get as drunk as ever to the glorious and immortal memory of
King George, and the prerogative is to be exalted as high as
ever, by being obliged to give up the Primate.  There! I think
I have told you volumes: yet I know you will not be content,
you will want to know something of the war, and of America;
but, I assure you, it is not the bon-ton to talk of either
this week.  We think not of the former, and of the latter we
should think to very little purpose '. for we have not heard a
syllable more; Braddock's defeat still remains in the
situation of the longest battle that ever was fought with
nobody.  Content your English spirit with knowing that there
are very near three thousand French prisoners in England,
taken out of several ships.



281 Letter 153
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Oct. 7, 1755.

My dear sir,
Nobody living feels more for you than I do: nobody knows
better either the goodness and tenderness of your heart, or
the real value of the person you have lost.' I cannot flatter
myself that any thing I could say would comfort you under an
affliction so well founded; but I should have set out, and
endeavoured to share your concern, if Mrs. Trevor had not told
me that you were going into Cheshire.  I will only say, that
if you think change of place can contribute at all to divert
your melancholy, you know where you would be most welcome; and
whenever you will come to Strawberry Hill, you will, at least,
if you do not find a comforter, find a most sincere friend
that pities your distress, and would do any thing upon earth
to alleviate your misfortune.  If you can listen yet to any
advice, let me recommend to you to give up all thoughts of
Greatworth; you will never be able to support life there any
more: let me look out for some little box for you in my
neighbourhood.  You can live nowhere where you will be more
beloved; and you will there always have it in your power to
enjoy company Or solitude, as you like.  I have long wished to
get you so far back into the world, and now it is become
absolutely necessary for your health and peace.  I will say no
more, lest too long a letter should be either troublesome or
make you think it necessary to answer; but do not, till you
find it more agreeable to vent your grief this way than in any
other.  I am, my good Sir, with hearty concern and affection,
yours most sincerely.

(619) His sister, Miss Harriet Montagu.



281 Letter 154
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, Oct. 19, 1755.

Do you love royal quarrels?  You may be served-I know you
don't love an invasion-nay, that even passes my taste; it will
make too much party.  In short, the lady dowager Prudence
begins to step a little over the threshold of that discretion
which she has always hitherto so sanctimoniously observed.
She is suspected of strange whims; so strange, as neither to
like more German subsidies or more German matches.  A strong
faction, professedly against the treaties,(620) openly against
Mr. Fox, and covertly under the banners of the aforesaid lady
Prudence, arm from all quarters against the opening of the
session.  Her ladyship's eldest boy declares violently against
being bewulfenbuttled,(621) a word which I don't pretend to
understand, as it is not in Mr. Johnson's new dictionary.
There! now I have been as enigmatic as ever I have accused you
of being; and hoping you will not be able to expound my German
hieroglyphics, I proceed to tell you in plain English that we
are going to be invaded.  I have within this day or two seen
grandees of ten, twenty, and thirty thousand pounds a-year,
who are in a mortal fright; consequently, it would be
impertinent in much less folk to tremble, and accordingly they
don't.  At court there is no doubt but an attempt will be made
before Christmas.  I find valour is like virtue: impregnable
as they boast themselves, it is discovered that on the first
attack both lie strangely open!  They are raising more men,
camps are to be formed in Kent and Sussex, the Duke of
Newcastle is frightened out of his wits, which, though he has
lost so often, you know he always recovers, and as fresh as
ever.  Lord Egmont despairs of the commonwealth; and I am
going to fortify my castle of Strawberry, according to an old
charter I should have had for embattling and making a deep
ditch.  But here am I laughing when I really ought to cry,
both with my public eye and my private one.  I have told you
what I think ought to sluice my public eye; and your private
eye too will moisten, when I tell you that poor Miss Harriet
Montagu is dead.  She died about a fortnight ago; but having
nothing else to tell you, I would not send a letter so far
with only such melancholy news-and so, you will say, I stayed
till I could tell still more bad news.  The truth is, I have
for some time had two letters of yours to answer: it is three
weeks since I wrote to you, and one begins to doubt whether
one shall ever be to write again.  I will hope all my best
hopes; for I have no sort of intention at this time of day of
finishing either as a martyr or a hero.  I rather intend to
live and record both those professions, if need be; and I have
no inclination to scuttle barefoot after a Duke of
Wolfenbuttle's army as Philip de Comines says he saw their
graces of Exeter and Somerset trudge after the Duke of
Burgundy's.  The invasion, though not much in fashion yet,
begins, like Moses's rod, to swallow other news, both
political and suicidical.  Our politics I have sketched out to
you, and can only add, that Mr. Fox's ministry does not as yet
promise to be of long duration.  When it was first thought
that he had cot the better of the Duke of Newcastle, Charles
Townshend said admirably, that he was sure the Duchess, like
the old Cavaliers, would make a vow not to shave her beard
till the restoration.

I can't recollect the least morsel of a fess or chevron of the
Boynets: they did not happen to enter into any extinct
genealogy for whose welfare I interest myself.  I sent your
letter to Mr. Chute, who is still under his own vine: Mr.
Muntz is still with him, recovering of a violent fever.
Adieu! If memoirs don't grow too memorable, I think this
season will produce a large crop.

P. S. I believe I scarce ever mentioned to you last Winter the
follies of the Opera: the impertinences of a great singer were
too old and common a topic.  I must mention them now, when
they rise to any improvement in the character Of national
folly.  The Mingotti, a noble figure, a great mistress of
music, and a most incomparable actress, surpassed any thing I
ever saw for the extravagance of her humours.(622)  She never
sung above one night in three, from a fever upon hot-temper:
and never would act at all when Ricciarelli, the first man,
was to be in dialogue with her.(623)  Her fevers grow so high,
that the audience caught them, and hissed her more than once:
she herself once turned and hissed again--Tit pro tat geminat
phoy d'achamiesmeyn--among the treaties which a secretary of
state has negotiated this summer, he has contracted for a
succedaneum to the Mingotti.  In short, there is a woman hired
to sing when the other shall be- out of humour!

Here is a "World" by Lord Chesterfield:(624) the first part is
very pretty, till it runs into witticism.  I have marked the
passages I particularly like.

You would not draw Henry IV. at a siege for me: pray don't
draw Louis XV.(625

(620) Lord Chesterfield, in a letter to Mr. Dayrolles, of the
4th of this month, says, "the next which now draws very near,
will, I believe, be a very troublesome one; and I really think
it very doubtful whether the subsidiary treaties with Russia
and Cassel will be carried or not.  To be sure, much may be
said against both; but yet I dread the consequences of
rejecting them by Parliament, since they are made."-E.

(621) This is an allusion to a contemplated marriage between
the Prince of Wales, afterwards George the Third, and a
daughter of the Duke of Brunswick Wolfenbuttle.  The following
is Lord Waldegrave's account of this project:--"An event
happened about the middle of the summer, which engaged
Leicester House still deeper in faction than they at first
intended.  The Prince of Wales was just entering into his
eighteenth year; and being of a modest, sober disposition,
with a healthy, vigorous constitution, it might reasonably be
supposed that a matrimonial companion might be no unacceptable
amusement.  The Duchess of Brunswick Wolfenbuttle, with her
two unmarried daughters, waited on his Majesty at Hanover.
The older, both as to person and understanding, was a most
accomplished Princess: the King was charmed with her cheerful,
modest, and sensible behaviour, and wished to make her his
granddaughter, being too old to make her his wife.  I remember
his telling me, with great eagerness, that had he been only
twenty years younger, she would never have been refused by a
Prince of Wales, but should at once have been Queen of
England.  Now, whether his Majesty spoke seriously is very
little to the purpose; his grandson's happiness was
undoubtedly his principal object; and he was desirous the
match might be concluded before his own death, that the
Princess of Wales should have no temptation to do a Job for
her relations, by marrying her son to one of the Saxe Gotha
family, who might not have the amiable accomplishments of the
Princess of Wolfenbuttle.  The King's intentions, it may
easily be imagined, were not agreeable to the Princess of
Wales.  She knew the temper of the Prince her son; that he was
by nature indolent, hated business, but loved a domestic life,
and would make an excellent husband.  She knew also that the
young Princess, having merit and understanding equal to her
beauty, must in a short time have the greatest influence over
him.  In which circumstances, it may naturally be concluded
that her Royal Highness did every thing in her Power to
prevent the match.  The Prince of Wales was      taught to
believe that he was to be made a sacrifice merely to gratify the
King's private interest in the electorate of Hanover.  The
young Princess was most cruelly misrepresented; many even of
her perfections were aggravated into faults; his Royal
Highness implicitly believing every idle tale and improbable
assertion, till his prejudice against her amounted to aversion
itself." Memoirs, p. 39.-E.

(622) The following is Dr. Burney's account:--"Upon the
success of Jomelli's 'Andromaca' a damp was thrown by the
indisposition of Mingotti, during which Frasi was called upon
to play her part in that opera; when suspicion arising, that
Mingotti's was a mere dramatic and political cold, the public
was much out of humour, till she resumed her function in
Metastasio's admirable drama of 'Demofoonte,' in which she
acquired more applause, and augmented her theatrical
consequence beyond any period of her performance in
England."-E.

(623) "Ricciarelli was a neat and pleasing performer, with a
clear, flexible, and silver-toned voice; but so much inferior
to Mingotti, both in singing and acting, that he was never in
very high favour." Burney.-E.

country.-E.

for a picture, in the letter of the 15th of August (letter
143), and to the then expected invasion of' England by Louis
XV.



284 Letter 155
To John Chute, Esq.(626)
Arlington Street, October 20, 1755.

You know, my dear Sir, that I do not love to have you taken
unprepared: the last visit I announced to you was of the Lord
Dacre of the South and of the Lady Baroness, his spouse: the
next company you may expect will be composed of the Prince of
Soubise and twelve thousand French; though, as winter is
coming on, they will scarce stay in the country, but hasten to
London.  I need   not protest to you I believe, that I am
serious, and that an invasion before Christmas will certainly
be attempted; you will believe me at the first word.  It is a
little hard, however! they need not envy us General Braddock's
laurels; they were not in such quantity!

Parliamentary and subsidiary politics are in great ferment.  I
could tell you much if I saw you; but I will not while you
stay there--yet, as I am a true friend and not to be changed
by prosperity, I can't neglect offering YOU my services when I
am cens`e to be well with a minister.  It is so long since I
was, and I believe so little a while that I shall be so,, (to
be sure, I mean that he will be minister,) that I must faire
valoir my interest, while I have any-in short, shall I get you
one of these new independent companies ?-Hush! don't tell Mr.
Muntz how powerful I am: his warlike spirit will want to
coincide with my ministerial one; and it would be very
inconvenient to the Lords Castlecomers to have him knocked on
the head before he had finished all the strawberries and vines
that we lust after.

I had a note from Gray, who is still at Stoke; and he desired
I would tell you, that he has continued pretty well.  Do come.
Adieu!

Lottery tickets rise: subsidiary treaties under par--I don't
say, no                   price.    Lord Robert Bertie, with a
company of the Guards, has                   thrown himself
into Dover castle; don't they sound very war-full?

285 Letter 156
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 27, 1755.

When the newspapers swarm with our military preparations at
home, with encampments, fire-ships, floating castles at the
mouths of the great rivers, etc. in short, when we expect an
invasion, you would chide, or be disposed to chide me, if I
were quite silent-and yet, what can I tell you more than that
an invasion is threatened?  that sixteen thousand men are
about Dunkirk, and that they are assembling great quantities
of flat-bottomed boats! Perhaps they will attempt some
landing; they are certainly full of resentment; they broke the
peace, took our forts and built others on our boundaries; we
did not bear it patiently; we retook two forts, attacked or
have been going to attack others, and have taken vast numbers
of their ships: this is the state of the provocation--what is
more provoking, for once we have not sent twenty or thirty
thousand men to Flanders on whom they might vent their
revenge.  Well! then they must come here, and perhaps invite
the Pretender to be of the party; not in a very popular light
for him, to be brought by the French in revenge of a national
war.  You will ask me, if we are alarmed? the people not at
all so: a minister or two, who are subject to alarms, are--and
that is no bad circumstances We are as much an island as ever,
and I think a much less exposed one than we have been for many
years.  Our fleet is vast; our army at home, and ready, and
two-thirds stronger than when we were threatened in 1744; the
season has been the wettest that ever has been known,
consequently the roads not very invade-able: and there is the
additional little circumstance of the late rebellion defeated;
I believe I may reckon too, Marshal Saxe dead.  You see our
situation is not desperate: in short, we escaped in '44, and
when the rebels were at Derby in '45; we must have bad luck
indeed, if we fall now.

Our Parliament meets in a fortnight; if no French come, our
campaign there will be warm; nay, and uncommon, the opposition
will be chiefly composed of men in place.  You know we always
refine; it used to be an imputation on our senators, that they
opposed to get places.  They now oppose to get better places!
We are a comical nation (I Speak with all due regard to our
gravity!)-It were a pity we should be destroyed, if it were
only for the sake of posterity; we shall not be half so droll,
if we are either a province to France, or under an absolute
prince of our own.

I am sorry you are losing my Lord Cork; you must balance the
loss with that of Miss Pitt,(627) who is a dangerous inmate.
You ask me if I have seen Lord Northumberland's Triumph of
Bacchus;(628) I have not: you know I never approved the
thought of those copies and have adjourned my curiosity till
the gallery is thrown open with the first masquerade.  Adieu!
my dear Sir.

(627) Elizabeth Pitt, sister of Lord Chatham@ She had been
maid of honour to Augusta Princess of Wales; then lived openly
with Lord Talbot as his mistress; went to Italy, turned
Catholic, and married; came back, wrote against her brother,
and a trifling pamphlet recommending magazines of corn, and
called herself Clara Villiers Pitt.

(628) Hugh, Earl and afterwards Duke of Northumberland,
bespoke at a great price five copies of capital pictures in
Italy, by Mentz, Pompeo, Battoni, etc. for his gallery at
Northumberland House.



286 Letter 157
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, October 31, 1755.

As the invasion is not ready, we are forced to take up with a
victory.  An account came yesterday, that General Johnson(629)
had defeated the French near the lake St. Sacrement, had
killed one thousand, and taken the lieutenant-general who
commanded them prisoner! his name is Dieskau, a Saxon, an
esteemed `el`eve of Marshal Saxe.  By the printed account,
which I enclose, Johnson showed great generalship and bravery.
As the whole business was done by irregulars, it does not
lessen the faults of Braddock, and the panic of his troops.
If I were so disposed, I could conceive that there are heroes
in the world who are not quite pleased with this extra-
martinette success(630)--but we won't blame those Alexanders,
till they have beaten the French in Kent! You know it will be
time enough to abuse them, when they have done all the service
they can!  The other enclosed paper is another World,(631) by
my Lord Chesterfield; not so pretty, I think, as the last; yet
it has merit.  While England and France are at war, and Mr.
Fox and Mr. Pitt going to war, his lordship is coolly amusing
himself at picquet at Bath with a Moravian baron, who would be
in prison, if his creditors did not occasionally release him
to play with and cheat my Lord Chesterfield, as the only
chance they have for recovering their- money!

We expect the Parliament to be thronged., and great
animosities.  I will not send you one of the eggs that are
laid; for so many political ones have been addled of late
years, that I believe all the state game-cocks in the world
are impotent.

I did not doubt but u would be struck with the death of poor
Bland.(632)  I, t'other night, at White's, found a very
remarkable entry in our very-very remarkable wager-book: "Lord
Mountford(633) bets Sir John Bland twenty guineas that Nash
outlives Cibbor!" How odd that these two old creatures,
selected for their antiquities, should live to see both their
wagerers put an end to their own lives! Cibber is within a few
days of eighty-four, still hearty, and clear, and well.  I
told him I was glad to see him look so well: "Faith," said he,
"it is very well that I look at all!"--I shall thank you for
the Ormer shells and roots; and shall desire your permission
to finish my letter already.  As the Parliament is to meet so
soon, you are likely to be overpowered with my despatches.--I
have been thinning my wood of trees and planting them out more
into the field: I am fitting up the old kitchen for a
china-room: I am building a bedchamber for my self over the
old blue-room, in which I intend to die, though not yet; and
some trifles of this kind, which I do not specify to you,
because I intend to reserve a little to be quite new to you.
Adieu!

(629) In the Following month created Sir William Johnson,
Bart.  Parliament was so satisfied with his conduct on this
occasion, that it voted him the sum of 5000 pounds.  He
afterwards distinguished himself as a negotiator with the
Indian tribes, and was ultimately chosen colonel of the Six
Nations, and superintendent of Indian affairs for the northern
parts of America.  He became well acquainted with the manners
and language of the Indians, and in 1772, sent to the Royal
Society some valuable communications relative to them.  He
died in 1774.-E.

287 Letter 158
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Nov. 8, 1755.

My dear sir,
You oblige me extremely by giving me this commission; and
though I am exceedingly unlike Solomon in every thing else, I
will at least resemble him in remembering you to the Hiram
from whom I obtained my cedars of libanus.  He is by men
called Christopher Gray, nurseryman at Fulham.  I mention
cedars first, because they are the most beautiful of the
evergreen race, and because they are the dearest; half a
guinea apiece in baskets.  The arbutus are scarce a crown
apiece, but they are very beautiful: the lignumvitae I would
not recommend to you; they stink abominably if you touch them,
and never make a handsome tree: The Chinese arborvitae is very
beautiful.  I have a small nursery myself, scarce bigger than
one of those pleasant gardens which Solomon describes, and
which if his fair one meant the church, I suppose must have
meant the churchyard.  Well, out of this little parsley-bed of
mine, I can furnish you with a few plants, particularly three
Chinese arborvitaes, a dozen of the New England or Lord
Weymouth's pine, which is that beautiful tree that we have so
much admired at the Duke of Argyle's for its clean straight
stem, the lightness of its hairy green, and for being
feathered quite to the ground: they should stand in a moist
soil, and Care must be taken every year to clear away all
plants and trees round them, that they may have free air and
room to expand themselves.  Besides these' I shall send you
twelve stone or Italian pine, twelve pinasters, twelve black
spruce firs, two Caroline cherries, thirty evergreen cytisus,
a pretty shrub that grows very fast, and may be cut down as
you please, fifty Spanish brooms, and six acacias, the
genteelest tree of all, but you must take care to plant them
in a first row, and where they will be well sheltered, for the
least wind tears and breaks them to pieces.  All these are
ready, whenever you will give me directions, how and where to
send them.  They are exceedingly small, as I have but lately
taken to propagate myself; but then they will travel more
safely, will be more sure of living, and will grow faster than
larger.  Other sorts Of trees that you must have, are silver
and Scotch firs; Virginia cedars, which should stand forwards
and have nothing touch them; and above all cypresses, which, I
think, are my chief passion; there is nothing So picturesque,
where they Stand two or three in a clump, upon a little
hillock, or rising above low shrubs, and particularly near
buildings.  There is another bit of picture, of which I am
fond, and that is a larch or a spruce fir planted behind a
weeping willow, and shooting upwards as the willow depends.  I
think for courts about a house, or winter gardens, almond
trees mixed with evergreens, particularly with Scotch firs,
have a pretty effect, before any thing else comes out; whereas
almond trees being generally planted among other trees, and
being in bloom before other trees have leaves, have no ground
to show the beauty of their blossoms.  Gray at Fulham sells
cypresses in pots at half a crown apiece; you turn them out of
the pot with all their mould, and they never fall.  I think
this is all you mean; if you have anymore garden-questions or
commissions, you know you command my little knowledge.

I am grieved that you have still any complaints left.
Dissipation, in my opinion, will be the best receipt; and I do
not speak merely for my own sake, when I tell you, how much I
wish to have you keep your resolution of coming to town before
Christmas.  I am still more pleased with the promise you make
to Strawberry, which you have never seen in its green coat
since it cut its teeth.  I am here all alone, and shall stay
till Tuesday, the day after the birthday.  On Thursday begins
our warfare, and if we may believe signs and tokens, our
winter will be warlike-.  I mean at home; I have not much
faith in the invasion.  Her Royal Highness and His Royal
Highness(634) are likely to come to an open rupture.  His
grace of Newcastle, who, I think, has gone under every
nickname, waits, I believe to see to which he will cling.
There have been two Worlds by my Lord Chesterfield lately,
very pretty, the rest very indifferent.

(634) The Princess Dowager and the Duke of Cumberland.



 289 Letter 159
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Arlington street, Nov. 15, 1755.

I promised you histories, and there are many people that take
care I should have it in my power to keep my word.  To begin
in order, I should tell you that there were 289 members at the
Cockpit meeting, the greatest number ever known there: but Mr.
Pitt, who is too great a general to regard numbers, especially
when there was a probability of no great harmony between the
commanders, did not, however, postpone giving battle.  The
engagement was not more decisive than long: we sat till within
a quarter of five in the morning; an uninterrupted serious
debate from before two.  Lord Hillsborough moved the address,
and very injudiciously supposed an opposition.  Martin,
Legge's secretary, moved to omit in the address the indirect
approbation of the treaties, and the direct assurances of
protection to Hanover.  These questions were at length
divided: and against Pitt's inclination, the last, which was
the least unpopular, was first decided by a majority of 311
against 105.  Many then went away; and on the next division
the numbers were 290 to 89.  These are the general outlines.
The detail of the speeches, which were very long, and some
extremely fine, it would be impossible to give you in any
compass.  On the side of the opposition, (which I must tell
you by the way, though it set out decently, seems extremely
resolved) the speakers (I name them in their order) were: the
3d Colebrook, Martin, Northey, Sir Richard Lyttelton,
Doddington, George Grenville, Sir F. Dashwood, Beckford, Sir
G. Lee, Legge, Potter, Dr. Hay, George Townshend, Lord Egmont,
Pitt, and Admiral Vernon on the other side were, Lord
Hillsborough, Obrien, young Stanhope,(635) Hamilton, Alstone,
Ellis, Lord Barrington, Sir G. Lyttelton, Nugent, Murray, Sir
T. Robinson, my uncle, and Mr. Fox.  As short as I can, I will
give you an account of them.  Sir Richard, Beckford, Potter,
G. Townshend, the Admiral of course, Martin, Stanhope, and
Ellis, were very bad: Doddington was well, but very acceding:
Dr. Hay by no means answers his reputation; it was easy but
not striking.  Lord Egmont was doubting, absurd, and obscure.
Sir G. Lee and Lord Barrington were much disliked; I don't
think so deservedly.  Poor Alstone was mad, and spoke ten
times to order.  Sir George(636) our friend, was dull and
timid.  Legge was the latter.  Nugent roared, and Sir Thomas
rumbled.  My uncle did justice to himself, and was as wretched
and dirty as his whole behaviour for his coronet has been.
Mr. Fox was extremely fatigued, and did little.  Geo.
Grenville's was very fine and much beyond himself, and very
pathetic.  The Attorney-general(637) in the same style, and
very artful, was still finer.  Then there was a young Mr.
Hamilton,(638) who spoke for the first time, and was at Once
perfection: his speech set, and full of antithesis, but those
antitheses were full of argument: indeed his speech was the
most argumentative of the whole day; and he broke through the
regularity of his own composition, answered other people, and
fell into his own track again with the greatest ease.  His
figure is advantageous, his voice strong and clear, his manner
spirited, and the whole with the ease of an established
speaker.  You will ask, what could be beyond this?  Nothing,
but what was beyond what ever was, and that was Pitt! He spoke
at past one, for an hour and thirty-five minutes: there was
more humour, wit, vivacity, finer language, more boldness, in
short, more astonishing perfections, than even you who are
used to him, can conceive. He was not abusive, yet very
attacking on all sides: he ridiculed my Lord Hillsborough,
crushed poor Sir George, terrified the Attorney, lashed my
Lord Granville, painted my Lord of Newcastle, attacked Mr.
Fox, and even hinted up to the Duke.(639)  A few of the Scotch
were in the minority, and most of the Princess's people, not
all: all the Duke of Bedford's in the majority.  He himself
spoke in the other House for the address (though professing
incertainty about the treaties themselves), against my Lord
Temple and Lord Halifax, without a division.  My Lord Talbot
was neuter; he and I were of a party: my opinion was strongly
with the opposition; I could not vote for the treaties; I
would not vote against Mr. Fox.  It is ridiculous perhaps, at
the end of such a debate, to give an account of my own
silence; and as it is of very little consequence what I did,
so it is very unlike me to justify myself.  You know how much
I hate professions of integrity; and my pride is generally too
great to care what the generality of people say of me: but
your heart is good enough to make me wish you should think
well of mine.

You will want to know what is to be the fate of the ministry
in opposition: but that I can't tell you.  I don't believe
they have determined what to do, more than oppose, nor that it
is determined what to do with them.  Though it is clear that
it is very humiliating to leave them in place, you may
conceive several reasons why it is not eligible to dismiss
them.  You know where you are, how easy it is to buy an
opposition who have not places; but tell us what to do with an
opposition that has places? If you say, Turn them out; I
answer, That is not the way to quiet any opposition, or a
ministry so constituted as ours at present.  Adieu!

(635) Son of the Earl of Chesterfield; who upon this occasion
addressed the House for the first time.  "His father," says
Dr. Maty, "took infinite pains to prepare him for his first
appearance as a speaker.  The young man seems to have
succeeded tolerably well upon the whole, but on account of his
shyness was obliged to stop, and, if I am not mistaken, to
have recourse to his notes.  Lord Chesterfield used every
argument in his power to comfort him, and to inspire him with
confidence and courage to make some other attempt; but I have
not heard that Mr. Stanhope ever spoke again in the House."-

(636) Sir George Lyttelton.

being followed, as was naturally expected, by repeated
exhibitions of similar eloquence, acquired for him the name of
single-speech Hamilton.

291 Letter 160
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, November 16, 1755.

Never was poor invulnerable Immortality so soon brought to
shame! Alack! I have had the gout! would fain have persuaded
myself that it was a sprain: and, then, that it was only the
gout come to look for Mr. Chute at Strawberry Hill: but none
of my evasions will do! I was, certainly, lame for two days;
and though I repelled it--first, by getting wet-shod, and then
by spirits of camphor; and though I have since tamed it more
rationally by leaving off the little wine I drank, I still
know where to look for it whenever I have an occasion for a
political illness.  Come, my constitution is not very much
broken, when, in four days after such a mortifying attack, I
could sit in the House of Commons, full as possible, from two
at noon till past five in the morning, as we did but last
Thursday.  The new opposition attacked the address.  Who are
the new opposition? Why, the old opposition-- Pitt and the
Grenvilles; indeed, with Legge instead of Sir George
Lyttelton.  Judge how entertaining it was to me to hear
Lyttelton answer Grenville, and Pitt Lyttelton! The debate,
long and uninterrupted as it was, was a great deal of it
extremely fine: the numbers did not answer to the merit: the
new friends, the Duke of Newcastle and Mr. Fox, had 311 to
105.  The bon-mot in fashion is, that the staff was very good,
but they wanted private Men. Pitt surpassed himself, and then
I need not tell you that he surpassed Cicero and Demosthenes.
What a figure would they, with their formal, laboured, cabinet
orations, make vis-`a-vis his manly vivacity and dashing
eloquence at one o'clock in the morning, after sitting in that
heat for eleven hours! He spoke above an hour and a half, with
scarce a bad sentence: the most admired part was a comparison
he drew of the two parts of the new administration, to the
conflux of the Rhone and the Saone; "the latter a gentle,
feeble, languid stream, languid but not deep; the other a
boisterous and overbearing torrent; but they joined at last;
and long may they continue united, to the comfort of each
other, and to the glory, honour, and happiness of this
nation!"  I hope you are not mean-spirited enough to dread an
invasion, when the senatorial contests are reviving in the
temple of Concord.-But will it make a party? Yes, truly: I
never saw so promising a prospect.  Would not it be cruel, at
such a period, to be laid up?

I have only had a note from you to promise me a letter; but it
is not arrived:--but the partridges are, and well; and I thank
you.

England seems returning:(640) for those who are not in
Parliament, there are nightly riots at Drury-lane, where there
is an anti-Gallican party against some French dancers.  The
young men of quality have protected them till last night,
when, being Opera night, the galleries were victorious.(641)

Montagu writes me many kind things for you; he is in Cheshire,
but comes to town this winter.  Adieu! I have so much to say,
that I have time to say but very little.

P. S. George Selwyn hearing much talk of a sea-war or a
continent, said, , I am for a sea-war and a continent
admiral."

(640) Walpole means the disposition towards mobs and rioting
at public places, which was then common among young men, and
had been a sort of fashion in his early youth.-E.

(641) A spectacle brought out by Garrick, in the beginning of
this month, at Drury-lane gave great offence to the public, in
consequence of the number of foreigners employed in it; and,
on the sixth representation, a violent riot took place, by
which a damage to the theatre was incurred of several thousand
pounds.-E.



292 Letter 161
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 16, 1755.

I have received a letter from you of Oct. 25th, full of
expectation of the invasion I announced to you-but we have got
two new parties erected, and if you imagine that the invasion
is attended to, any more than as it is played off by both
those parties, you know little of England.  The Parliament met
three days ago: we have been so un-English lately as to have
no parties at all, have now got what never was seen before, an
opposition in administration.  Mr. Pitt, Mr. Legge, and their
adherents, no great number, have declared open and unrelenting
war with the Duke of Newcastle and Mr. Fox; and on the
address, which hinted approbation of the late treaties, and
promised direct support of Hanover, we sat till five the next
morning.  If eloquence could convince, Mr. Pitt would have had
more than 105 against 31 1; but it is long since the arts of
persuasion were artful enough to persuade-rhetoric was
invented before places and commissions! The expectation of the
world is suspended, to see whether these gentlemen will resign
or be dismissed: perhaps neither; perhaps they may continue in
place and opposition; perhaps they may continue in place and
not oppose.  Bossuet wrote "L'Histoire des Variations de
l'Eglise"-I think I could make as entertaining a history,
though not so well written, "des Variations de l'Etat:"i mean
of changes and counterchanges of party.  The Duke of Newcastle
thought himself undone, beat up all quarters for support, and
finds himself stronger than ever.  Mr. Fox was thought SO
unpopular, that his support was thought as dangerous as want
of defence; every thing bows to him.  The Tories hate both him
and Pitt so much, that they sit still to see them worry one
another; they don't seem to have yet found out that while
there are parts and ambition, they will be obliged to follow
and to hate by turns every man who has both.

I don't at all understand my Lady Orford's politics; but that
is no wonder, when I am sure she does not understand ours.
Nobody knows what to make of the French inactivity: if they
intend some great stroke, the very delay and forbearance tells
us to prepare for it, and a surprise prepared for loses much
of its value.  For my own part, I have not prophetic sagacity
enough to foresee what will be even the probable event either
of our warlike or domestic politics.  I desired your brother
to write you an account of General Johnson's victory; the only
great circumstance in our favour that has happened yet.  The
greatest mystery of all is the conduct of Admiral Boscawen:
since he left England, though they write private letters to
their friends, he and all his officers have not sent a single
line to the Admiralty; after great pain and uncertainty about
him, a notion prevailed yesterday, how well-founded I know
not, that without any orders he is gone to attack
Louisbourgh-considering all I have mentioned, he ought to be
very sure of success.  Adieu! my dear Sir, I have told you the
heads of all I know, and have not time to be more particular.

P. S. I am glad to be able to contradict an untruth, before I
send it away -. Admiral Boscawen and his fleet are arrived,
and have brought along with them a French man-of-war of
seventy-four guns.



293 Letter 162
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, November 25, 1755.

I have been so hurried since I came to town, and so enclosed
in the House of Commons, that I have not been able to write a
line sooner.  I now write, to notify that your plants will set
out according to your direction next Monday, and are ordered
to be left at Namptwich.

I differ with the doctors about planting evergreens in spring;
if it happens to be wet weather, it may be better than
exposing them to a first winter: but the cold dry winds, that
generally prevail in spring, are ten times more pernicious.
In my own opinion, the end of September is the best season,
for then they shoot before the hard weather comes.  But the
plants I send you are so very small, that they are equally
secure in any season, and would bear removing in the middle of
summer; a handful of dung will clothe them all for the whole
winter.

There is a most dreadful account of an earthquake in
Lisbon,(642) but several people will not believe it.  There
have been lately such earthquakes and waterquakes, and rocks
rent, and other strange phenomena, that one would think the
world exceedingly out of repair.  I am not prophet enough to
believe that such convulsions relate solely to the struggles
between Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox, or even portend any between the
Georges and Jameses.  You have already heard, I suppose, that
Pitt, Legge, and George Grenville, are dismissed, and that Sir
George Lyttelton is chancellor of the exchequer.  My Lord
Temple says that Sir George Lyttelton said he would quit his
place when they did, and that he has kept his word! The world
expects your cousin to resign; but I believe all efforts are
used to retain him.  Joan, the fair maid of Saxe-Gotha, did
not speak to Mr. Fox or Sir George when they kissed her hand
last Sunday.  No more places are vacated or filled up yet.

It is an age since I have heard from Mr. Bentley; the war or
the weather have interrupted all communication.  Adieu! let me
know at your leisure, when one is likely to see you.

(642) The dreadful earthquake, on the 1st of November, which
laid nearly the whole city in ruins.  The number of
inhabitants who lost their lives was variously reported, but
generally estimated at about ten thousand.-E.



294 Letter 163
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec. 4, 1755.

Long before you receive this, my dear Sir, you will have
learned general, if not particular accounts of the dreadful
desolation at Lisbon: the particulars indeed are not yet come
hither; all we have heard hitherto is from France, and from
Sir Benjamin Keene at Madrid.  The catastrophe is greater than
ever happened even in your neighbourhood, Naples.  Our share
is very considerable, and by some reckoned at four millions.
We are despatching a ship with a present of an hundred
thousand pounds in provisions and necessaries, for they want
every thing.  There have been Kings of Spain who would have
profited of such a calamity; but the present MONARCH has only
acted as if he had a title to Portugal, by showing himself a
father to that people.(643)

We are settled, politically, into a regular opposition.  Mr.
Pitt, Mr. Legge, and George Grenville have received their
dismissions, and oppose regularly.  Sir George Lyttelton, who
last year with that connexion, is made chancellor of the
exchequer.  As the subsidies are not yet voted, and as the
opposition, though weak in numbers, are very strong in
speakers, no other places will be given away till Christmas,
that the re-elections may be made in the holidays.

There are flying reports that General Johnson, our only hero
at present, has taken Crown Point, but the report is entirely
unconfirmed by any good authority.  The invasion that I
announced to you, is very equivocal; there is some suspicion
that it was only called in as an ally to the subsidiary
treaties: many that come from France say, that on their coasts
they are dreading an invasion from us.  Nothing is certain but
their forbearance and good breeding-the meaning of that is
very uncertain.

Shall I send away a letter with only these three paragraphs! I
must if I write at all.  There are no private news at all! the
earthquake, the opposition, and the war, are the only topics;
each of those topics will be very fruitful, and you shall hear
of their offspring-at present, good night!

(643) The Spanish monarch did not long preserve that spirit of
justice.



295 Letter 164
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Arlington Street, Dec. 17, 1755.

After an immense interval, I have at last received a long
letter from you, of a very old date (November 5th), which
amply indemnifies my patience - nay, almost makes me amends
for your blindness; for I think, unless you had totally lost
your eyes, you would not refuse me a pleasure so easy to
yourself as now and then sending me a drawing.  I can't call
it laziness; one may be too idle to amuse one's self, but sure
one is never so fond of idleness as to prefer it to the power
of obliging a person one loves! And yet I own your letter has
made me amends, the wit of your pen recompenses the stupidity
of your pencil; the caestus you have taken up supplies a
little the artem you have relinquished.  I could quote twenty
passages that have charmed me: the picture of Lady Prudence
and her family; your idol that gave you hail when you prayed
for sunshine; misfortune the teacher of superstition;
unmarried people being the fashion in heaven; the Spectator-
hacked phrases; Mr. Spence's blindness to Pope's mortality;
and, above all, the criticism on the Queen in Hamlet, is most
delightful.  There never was so good a ridicule of all the
formal commentators on Shakspeare, nor so artful a banter on
himself for so improperly making her Majesty deal in
double-entendres at a funeral.  In short, I never heard as
much wit, except in a speech with which mr. Pitt concluded the
debate t'other day on the treaties.  His antagonists endeavour
to disarm him, but as fast as they deprive him of one weapon,
he finds a better; I never suspected him of such an universal
armoury-I knew he had a Gorgon's head, composed of bayonets
and pistols, but little thought that he could tickle to death
with a feather.  On the first debate on these famous treaties,
last Wednesday, Hume Campbell, whom the Duke of Newcastle had
retained as the most abusive counsel he could find against
Pitt (and hereafter perhaps against Fox), attacked the former
for eternal invectives.  Oh! since the last philippic of
Billingsgate memory you never heard such an invective as Pitt
returned-Hume Campbell was annihilated! Pitt, like an angry
wasp, seems to have left his sting in the wound, and has since
assumed a style of delicate ridicule and repartee.  But think
how charming a ridicule must that be that lasts and rises,
flash after flash, for an hour and a half! Some day or other,
perhaps you will see some of the glittering splinters that I
gathered up.  I have written under his print these lines,
which are not only full as just as the original, but have not
the tautology of loftiness and majesty:

""Three orators in distant ages born,
Greece, Italy, and England did adorn;
The first in loftiness of thought surpass'd,
The next in language, but in- both the last:
The power of Nature could no farther go;
To make a third, she join'd the former two."

Indeed, we have wanted such an entertainment to enliven and
make the fatigue supportable.  We sat on Wednesday till ten at
night; on Friday till past three in the morning; on Monday
till between nine and ten.(644)  We have profusion of orators,
and many very great, which is surprising so soon after the
leaden age(645 of the late Right Honourable Henry
Saturnus!(646)  The majorities are as great as in Saturnus's
golden age.

Our changes are begun; but not being made at once, our very
changes change.  Lord Duplin and Lord Darlington are made
joint paymasters: George Selwyn says, that no act ever showed
so much the Duke of Newcastle's absolute power as his being
able to make Lord Darlington a paymaster.  That so often
repatriated and reprostituted Doddington is again to be
treasurer of the navy; and he again drags out Harry Furnese
into the treasury.  The Duke of Leeds is to be cofferer, and
Lord Sandwich emerges so far as to be chief justice in eyre.
The other parts by the comedians; I don't repeat their names,
because perhaps the fellow that to-day is designed to act
Guildenstern, may to-morrow be destined to play half the part
of the second grave-digger.(647)  However, they are all to
kiss hands on Saturday.  mr. Pitt told me to-day that he
should not go to Bath till next week.  "I fancy," said I, "you
scarce stay to kiss hands."

With regard to the invasion, which you are so glad to be
allowed to fear, I must tell you that it is quite gone out of
fashion again, and I really believe was dressed up for a
vehicle (as the apothecaries call it) to make us swallow the
treaties.  All along the coast of France they are much more
afraid of an invasion than we are.

As obliging as you are in sending me plants, I am determined
to thank you for nothing but drawings.  I am not to be bribed
to silence, when you really disoblige me.  Mr. Muntz has
ordered more cloths for you.  I even shall send you books
unwillingly; and, indeed, why should I? As you are
stone-blind, what can you do with them?  The few I shall send
you, for there are scarce any now, will be a pretty dialogue
by Cr`ebillon; a strange imperfect poem, written by Voltaire
when he was very young, which with some charming strokes has a
great deal of humour manqu`e and of impiety estropi`ee; and an
historical romance, by him too, of the last war, in which is
so outrageous a lying anecdote of old Marlborough, as would
have convinced her, that when poets write history they stick
as little to truth in prose as in verse.  Adieu!

(644) Lord Chesterfield, in a letter to Mr. Dayrolles of the
19th, says, "The House of Commons sits three or four times a
week till nine or ten at night, and sometimes till four or
five in the morning; so attentive are they to the good of
their dear country.  That zeal has of late transported them
into much personal abuse.  Even our insignificant House sat
one day last week till past ten at night upon the Russian and
Hessian treaties; but I was not able to sit it out, and left
it at seven, more than half dead; for I took it into my head
to speak upon them for near an hour, which fatigue, together
with the heat of the house, very nearly annihilated me.  I was
for the Russian treaty as a prudent eventual measure at the
beginning of a war, and probably preventive even of a war in
that part of the world; but I could not help exposing, though
without opposing, the Hessian treaty, which is, indeed, the
most extraordinary one I ever saw."-E.

(645) " Here, pleased, behold her mighty wings outspread,
To hatch a new Saturnian age of Lead." Dunciad.-E.

(646) Mr. Pelham.

(647) "Places," writes Lord Chesterfield to Mr. Dayrolles on
the 19th, "are emptying and filling every day.  The patriot of
Monday is the courtier of Tuesday, and the courtier of
Wednesday is the patriot of Thursday.  This, indeed, has more
or less been long the case, but I really think never so
impudently and so profligately as now. @The power is all
falling from his Grace's into Fox's hands; which, you may
remember, I told you long ago would happen."-E.



297 Letter 165
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Dec. 20, 1755.

I am very much pleased that you are content with what are to
be trees a thousand years hence, though they were the best my
Libanus afforded.  I was afraid you would think I had sent you
a bundle of picktooths, instead of pines and firs: may you
live to chat under their shade! I am still more pleased to
hear that you are to be happy in some good fortune to the
Colonel: he deserves it; but, alas! what a claim is that!
Whatever makes him happy, makes you so, and consequently me.

A regular opposition, composed of immense abilities, has
entertained us for this month.  George Grenville, Legge, a Dr.
Hay, a Mr. Elliot, have shone; Charles Townshend lightened;
Pitt has rode in the whirlwind, and directed the storm with
abilities beyond the common reach of the genii of a tempest.
As soon as that storm has a little spent its fury, the dew of
preferments begins to fall and fatten the land.  Moses and
Aaron differ indeed a little in which shall dispense the
manna, and both struggle for their separate tribes.  Earl
Gower is privy seal, the Lords Darlington and Dublin joint
paymasters, Lord Gage paymaster of the pensions, Mr. O'Brien
in the treasury.  That old rag of a dishclout ministry, Henry
Furnese, is to be the other lord.  Lord Bateman and Dick
Edgcumbe(648) are the new admirals; Rigby, Soame Jennings, and
Talbot the Welsh judge, lords of trade; the Duke of Leeds
cofferer, Lord Sandwich chief justice in eyre, Ellis and Lord
Sandys (autre dishclout) divide the half of the treasury of
Ireland, George Selwyn paymaster of the board of works,
Arundel is to have a pension in Ireland, and Lord Hillsborough
succeeds him -,is treasurer of the chambers, though I thought
he was as fond of his white staff as my Lord Hobart will be,
who is to have it.  There, if you love new politics! You
understand, to make these vacancies, that Charles Townshend
and John Pitt are added to the dismissed and dead.

My Lord Townshend is dying; the young Lord Pembroke marries
the charming Lady Betty Spencer.(649)  The French are thought
to have passed eldest as to England, and to intend to take in
Hanover.  I know an old potentate who had rather have the gout
in his stomach than in that little toe.  Adieu! I have sent
your letter; make my compliments, and come to town.

648) Lord Edgecumbe.

(649) Second daughter of Charles second Duke of
Marlborough.-E.



298 Letter 166
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec. 12, 1755.

I am glad, my dear Sir, that you have not wasted many alarms
on the invasion; it does not seem to have been ever intended
by the French.  Our ministers, who are not apt to have any
intelligence, have now only had bad: they spread that idea; it
took for some days, but is vanished.  I believe we tremble
more really for Hanover: I can't say I do; for while we have
that to tremble for, we shall always be to tremble.  Great
expectations of a peace prevail; as it is not likely to be
good, it is not a season for venturing a bad one.  The
opposition, though not numerous, is now composed of very
determined and very great men; more united than the ministry,
and at least as able.  the resistance to the treaties has been
made with immense capacity: Mr. Pitt has shone beyond the
greatest horizon of his former lustre.  The Holidays are
arrived, and now the changes are making; but many of the
recruits, old deserters, old cashiered, old fagots, add very
little credit to the new coalition.  The Duke of Newcastle and
his coadjutor Mr. Fox squabble twice for agreeing once: as I
wish so well to the latter, I lament what he must wade through
to real power, if ever he should arrive there.  Underneath I
shall catalogue the alterations, with an additional letter to
each name, to particularize the corps to which each belongs.

Sir George Lyttelton, N. chancellor of the exchequer, in the
room of Mr. Legge, dismissed.

Duke of Leeds, N. Cofferer, in the room of Sir George
Lyttelton,

Mr. T. Brudenell N., Deputy. in the room of mr. Clare.

Mr. Doddington, F. Treasurer of the Navy, in the room of Sir
G. Grenville, dismissed.

Lords Darlington N. and Duplin N. Joint Paymasters, in the
room of mr. Pitt, dismissed

Duke of Marlborough, F. Master of the Ordnance.  Long Vacant.

Earl Gower, F., Lord Privy Seal, in the room of the duke of
Marlborough.

Lord Gage, N., Paymaster of Pensions, in the room of Mr.
Compton, dead,

Mr. Obrien, N. and mr. Henry Furnese, Lords of the Treasury,
in the room of Lord Darlington and Lord Duplin.

Lord Bateman, F., and Mr. Edgcumbe, F. Lords of the Admiralty,
in the room of mr. C. Townshend, dismissed and Mr. Ellis.

Judge Talbot Mr. S. Jennings, N. and mr. Rigby, F., Lords of
Trade, in the room of Mr. J. Grenville, resigned, Mr. T. Pitt,
dismissed, and Mr. Edgcumbe.

mr. Arundel, N., Pension on Ireland.

Lord Hilsborough, F. Treasurer of Chambers, in the room of mr.
Arundel.

Lord Hobart, N., Comptroller of the Household, in the room of
Lord Hilsborough.

George Selwyn, F., Paymaster of the Board of works, in the
room of Mr. Denzil Onslow.

Lord cholmondeley, who had had half before to divide Vice-
Treasurer of Ireland with Lord Sandwich, F., and Mr. Ellis, F.
in the room of Sir w. Yonge, deceased.

Lord Berkeley of Stratton, F., Treasurer of the Household, in
the room of Lord Fitzwalter, dying.

Lord Sandys, N., Chief Justice in eyre, in the room of the
duke of Leeds.

As numerous as these changes are, they are not so
extraordinary as the number of times that each designation has
been changed.  The four last have not yet kissed hands, so I
do not give you them for certain.  You will smile at seeing
Doddington again revolved to the court, and Lord Sandys and
Harry Furnese, two of the most ridiculous objects in the
succession to my father's ministry, again dragged out upon the
stage: perhaps it may not give you too high an idea of the
stability or dignity of the new arrangement; but as the Duke
of Newcastle has so often turned in and out all men in
England, he must employ some Of The same dukes over again.  In
short, I don't know whether all this will make your
ministerial gravity smile, but it makes me laugh out.  Adieu!

P. S. I must mention the case of my Lord Fitzwalter,(650)
which all the faculty say exceeds any thing known in their
practice: he is past eighty-four, was an old beau, and had
scarce ever more sense than he has at present; he has lived
many months upon fourteen barrels of oysters, four-and-twenty
bottles of port, and some, I think seven, bottles of brandy
per week.  What will Dr. Cocchi, with his Vitto Pittagorico,
say to this?

(650) Charles Mildmay, Earl Fitzwalter, so created May 14,
1730.  He died without issue, Feb. 29, 1756, when his earldom
became extinct; and the old barony of Fitzwalter fell into
abeyance among females.-D.



299 Letter 167
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Dec. 30, 1755.

As I know how much you are my friend and take part in my joy,
I cannot help communicating to you an incident that has given
much pleasure.  You know how much I love Mr. Mann-well, I
don't enter into that, nor into a detail of many hardships
that he has suffered lately, which made me still more eager to
serve him.  As some regiments have been just given away, I
cast my eyes about to see if I could not help him to clothing.
Among the rest, there was one new colonel,(651) whom I could
not assume enough to call my friend, but who is much connected
with one that is so.  As the time passed, I did not stay to go
round about, but addressed myself directly to the person
himself--but I was disappointed; the disaster was, that he had
left his quarters and was come to town.  Though I immediately
gave it up in my own mind, knew how incessantly he would be
pressed from much more powerful quarters, concluded he would
be engaged, I wrote again; that letter was as useless as the
first, and from what reason do you think? Why this person, in
spite of all solicitations, nay previous to any, had already
thought of Mr. Mann, and recollected it would oblige me and my
friend in the country, and had actually given his clothing to
Mr. Mann, before he received either of my letters.  Judge how
agreeably I have been surprised, and how much the manner has
added to my obligation! You will be still more pleased when
you hear the character of this officer, which I tell you
willingly, because I know you country gentlemen are apt to
contract prejudices, and to fancy that no virtues grow out of
your own shire; yet by this one sample, you will find them
connected with several circumstances that are apt to nip their
growth.  He is of as good a family as any in England, yet in
this whole transaction he has treated me with as much humility
is if I was of as good a family and as if I had obliged him,
not he me.  In the next place, I have no power to oblige him;
then, though he is young and in the army, he is as good, as
temperate, as meek, as if he was a curate on preferment; and
yet with all these meek virtues, nobody has distinguished
themselves by more personal bravery-and what is still more to
his praise, though he has so greatly established his courage,
he is as regular in his duty, and submits as patiently to all
the tedious exiles and fatigues of it, as if he had no merit
at all; but I will say no more, lest you imagine that the
present warmth of my gratitude makes me exaggerate.  No, you
will not, when you know that all I have said relates to your
own brother, Colonel Charles Montagu.  I did not think he
could have added still to my satisfaction; but he has, by
giving me hopes Of seeing you in town next week-till then,
adieu!  Yours as entirely as is consistent with my devotedness
to your brother.

(651) Colonel Charles Montagu, this day appointed to the
command of the 59th regiment of foot.-E.



300 Letter 168
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Jan. 6, 1756.

I am quite angry with you: you write me letters so
entertaining that they make me almost forgive your not
drawing: now, you know, next to being disagreeable, there is
nothing so shocking as being too agreeable.  However, as I am
a true philosopher, and can resist any thing I like better, I
declare, that if you don't coin the vast ingot of colours and
cloth that I have sent you, I will burn your letters unopened.

Thank you for all your concern about my gout, but I shall not
mind you; it shall appear in my stomach before I attempt to
keep it out of it by a fortification of wine: I only drank a
little two days after being very much fatigued in the House,
and the worthy pioneer began to cry succour from my foot the
next day.  However, though I am determined to feel young
still, I grow to take the hints age gives me; I come hither
oftener, I leave the town to the young; and though the busy
turn that the world has taken draws me back into it, I excuse
it to myself, and call it retiring into politics.  From hence
I must retire, or I shall be drowned; my cellars are four feet
under water, the Thames gives itself Rhone airs, and the
meadows are more flooded than when you first saw this place
and thought it so dreary.  We seem to have taken out our
earthquake in rain: since the third week in June, there have
not been five days together of dry weather.  They tell us that
at Colnbrook and Stains they are forced to live in the first
floor.  Mr. Chute is at the Vine, but I don't expect to hear
from him: no post but a dove can get from thence.  Every post
brings new earthquakes; they have felt them in France, Sweden,
and Germany: what a convulsion there has been in nature! Sir
Isaac Newton, somewhere in his works, has this beautiful
expression, "The globe will want manum emendatricem."

I have been here this week with only Mr. Muntz; from whence
you may conclude I have been employed--Memoirs thrive apace.
He seems to wonder (for he has not a little of your indolence,
I am not surprised you took to him) that I am continually
occupied every minute of the day, reading, writing, forming
plans: in short, you know me. He is an inoffensive, good
creature, but had rather ponder over a foreign gazette than a
pallet.

I expect to find George Montagu in town to-morrow: his brother
has at last got a regiment.  Not content with having deserved
it, before he got it, by distinguished bravery and
indefatigable duty, he persists in meriting it still.  He
immediately, unasked, gave the chaplainship (which others
always sell advantageously) to his brother's parson at
Greatworth.  I am almost afraid it will make my commendation
of this really handsome action look interested, when I add,
that he has obliged me in the same way by making Mr. Mann his
clothier, before I had time to apply for it.  Adieu! I find no
news in town.



302 Letter 169
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(652)
Arlington Street, Jan. 22, 1756.

As my Lady Ailesbury is so taken up with turnpike-hills,
Popish recusants, and Irish politics, and you are the only
idle person in the family (for Missy I find is engaged too), I
must return to correspond with you.  But my letters will not
be quite so lively as they have been: the Opposition, like
schoolboys, don't know how to settle to their books again
after the holidays.  We have not had a division: nay, not a
debate.  Those that like it, are amusing themselves with the
Appleby election.  Now and then we draggle on a little
militia.  The recess has not produced even a pamphlet.  In
short, there are none but great outlines of politics: a
memorial in French Billingsgate has been transmitted hither
which has been answered very laconically. More agreeable is
the guarantee signed with Prussia: M. Michel(653) is as
fashionable as ever General Wall was.  The Duke of Cumberland
has kept his bed with a sore leg, but is better.  Oh! I
forgot, Sir Harry Erskine is dismissed from the army, and if
you will suffer so low a pun, as upon his face, is a rubric
martyr for his country: bad as it Is, this is the best bon-mot
I have to send you: Ireland, which one did not suspect, is
become the staple of wit, and, I find, coins bons-mots for our
greatest men.  I might not send you Mr. Fox's repartee, for I
never heard it, nor has any body here: as you have, pray send
it me. Charles Townshend t'other night hearing somebody say,
that my Lady Falmouth, who had a great many diamonds on, had a
Very fine stomach, replied, "By God! my lord has a better."
You will be entertained with the riot Charles makes in the
sober house of Argyle: t'other night, on the Duchess's bawling
to my Lady Suffolk,(654) he in the very same tone cried out,
"Large stewing Oysters!"  When he takes such liberties with
his new parent, you may judge how little decency he observes
with his wife: last week at dinner at Lord Strafford's, on my
Lady Dalkeith's mentioning some dish that she loved, he
replied before all the servants, "Yes, my Lady Dalkeith, you
love it better than any thing but one!"

We were to have had a masquerade to-night, but the Bishops,
who you know have always persisted in God's hating dominos,
have made an earthquake point of it, and postponed it till
after the fast.

Your brother has got a sixth infanta; at the christening
night, Mr. Trail had got through two prayers before any body
found out that the child was not brought down stairs.  You see
pauvret`e how little I have to say.  Do accept the enclosed
World(655) in part of payment for the remainder of a letter.
I must conclude with telling you, that though I know her but
little, I admire my Lady Kildare as much as you do.  She has
writ volumes to Lady Caroline Fox in praise of you and your
Countess: you are a good soul! I can't say so much for lady
Ailesbury.  As to Missy, I am afraid I must resign my claim: I
never was very proper to contest with an Hibernian hero; and I
don't know how, but I think my merit does not improve.  Adieu!

303 Letter 170
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Arlington Street, Jan. 24, 1756.

Oh sir, I shall take care how I ever ask favours of you again!
It was with great reluctance that I brought myself to ask
this: you took no notice of my request; and I flattered myself
that I was punished for having applied to you so much against
my inclination.  Just as I grew confirmed in the pride of
being mortified, I hear that you have outgone my application,
and in the kindest manner in the world have given the young
man a pair of colours.  It would have been unpleasant enough
to be refused; but to obtain more than one asked is the most
provoking thing in the world! I was prepared to be very
grateful if you had done just what I desired; but I declare I
have no thanks ready for a work of supererogation.  If there
ever was a spirit that went to heaven for mere gratitude,
which I am persuaded is a much more uncommon qualification
than martyrdom, I must draw upon his hoard of merit to acquit
myself.  You will at least get thus much by this charming
manner of obliging me: I look upon myself as double obliged;
and when it cost me so much to ask one favour, and I find
myself in debt for two, I shall scarce run in tick for a
third.

What adds to my vexation is, that I wrote to you but the night
before last.  Unless I could return your kindness with equal
grace, it would be not very decent to imitate you by beginning
to take no notice of it; and therefore you must away with this
letter upon the back of the former.

We had yesterday some history in the House - Beckford produced
an accusation in form against Admiral Knowles on his way to an
impeachment.  Governor Verres was a puny culprit in
comparison!  Jamaica indeed has not quite so many costly
temples and ivory statues, etc. as Sicily had: but what
Knowles could not or had not a propensity to commit in rapine
and petty larceny, he has made up in tyranny.  The papers are
granted, and we are all going to turn jurymen.  The rest of
the day was spent in a kind of avoirdupois war.  Your friend
Sir George Lyttelton opened the budget; well enough in
general, but was strangely bewildered in the figures; he
stumbled over millions, and dwelt pompously upon farthings.
Pitt attacked him pretty warmly on mortgaging the sinking
fund;
Sir George kept up his spirit, and returned the attack on his
eloquence: it was entertaining enough, but ended in high
compliments; and the division was 231 to 5(;.

Your friend Lady Petersham, not to let the town quite lapse
into politics, has entertained it with a new scene.  She was
t'other night at the play with her court; viz. Miss Ashe, Lord
Barnard, M. St. Simon, and her favourite footman Richard,
whom, under pretence of keeping places, she always keeps in
her box the whole time to see the play at his ease.  Mr.
Stanley, Colonel Vernon, and Mr. Vaughan arrived at the very
end of the farce, and could find no room, but a row and a half
in Lady Caroline's box.  Richard denied them entrance very
impertinently.  Mr. Stanley took him by the hair of his head,
dragged him into the passage, and thrashed him.  The heroine
was outrageous--the heroes not at all so.(656)  She sent
Richard to Fielding for a warrant.  He would not grant it--and
so it ended--And so must I, for here is company.  Adieu!

My letter would have been much cleverer, but George Montagu
has been chattering by me the whole time, and insists on my
making you his compliments.

(656) Lady Hervey, in a letter of the 23d of March, thus
alludes to this story:--"This is the time of year you used to
come to town.  Come and hear a little what is going forward:
you will be alarmed with invasions which are never intended;
you will hear of ladies of quality who uphold footmen
insulting gentlemen; nay, you will hear of ladies who steal
not only hearts, but gold boxes."-E.



    304 Letter 171
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 25, 1756.

I am troubled to think what anxiety you have undergone! yet
your brother Gal. assures me that he has never missed writing
one week since he began to be ill.  Indeed, had I in the least
foreseen that his disorder would have lasted a quarter of the
time it has, I should have given you an account of it; but the
distance between us is so great, that I could not endure to
make you begin to be uneasy, when, in all probability, the
cause would be removed before my letter reached You.  This
tenderness for you has deceived me: your brother, as his
complaint is of the asthmatic kind, has continued all the time
at Richmond.  Our attendance in Parliament has been so
unrelaxed, the weather has been so bad, and the roads so
impracticable by astonishing and continued deluges of rain,
that, as I heard from him constantly three or four times a
week, and saw your brother James, who went to him every week,
I went to see him but twice; and the last time, about a
fortnight ago, I thought him extremely mended: he wrote me two
very comfortable notes this week of his mending, and this
morning Mr. Chute and I went to see him, and to scold him for
not having writ oftener to you, which he protests he has done
constantly.  I cannot flatter you, my dear child, as much as
to say I think him mended; his shortness of breath continues
to be very uneasy to him, and his long confinement has wasted
him a good deal. I fear his case is more consumptive than
asthmatic; he begins a course of quicksilver to-morrow for the
obstruction in his breast.  I shall go out to him again the
day after to-morrow, and pray as fervently as you yourself do,
my dear Sir, for his recovery.  You have not more obligations
to him, nor adore him more than I do.  As my tenderness and
friendship is so strong for you both, you may depend on
hearing from me constantly; but a declining constitution, you
know, will not admit of a very rapid recovery.  Though he is
fallen away, he looks well in the face, and his eyes are very
lively: the weather is very warm, he wants no advice, and I
assure YOU no solicitude for his health; no man ever was so
beloved, and so deservingly! Besides Dr. Baker, the physician
of Richmond, who is so much esteemed, he has consulted Dr.
Pringle, who is in the first repute, and who is strongly for
the quicksilver.  I enter Into these particulars, because,
when one is anxious, one loves to know the most minute.
Nothing is capable of making me so happy, as being able soon
to send you a better account.

Our politics wear a serener face than they have done of late:
you will have heard that our nephew of Prussia-I was going to
say, has asked blessing--begging our dignity's pardon, I fear
he has given blessing! In short, he guarantees the empire with
us from all foreign troops.  It is pleasant to think, that at
least we shall be to fight for ourselves.  Fight we must,
France says: but when she said so last, she knew nothing of
our cordiality with the court of Berlin.  Monsieur Rouill`e
very lately wrote to Mr. Fox, by way of Monsieur Bonac in
Holland, to say his master ordered the accompanying M`emoire
to be transmitted to his Britannic Majesty in person; it is
addressed to nobody, but after professing great disposition to
peace, and complaining in harsh terms of our brigandages and
pirateries, it says, that if we will restore their ships,
goods, etc. they shall then be ready to treat.  We have
returned a squab answer, retorting the infraction of treaties,
professing a desire of peace too, but declare we cannot
determine upon restitution comme pr`eliminaire.  If we do not,
the M`emoire says, they shall look upon it comme declaration
de guerre la plus authentique.  Yet, in my own opinion, they
will not declare it; especially since the King of Prussia has
been Russianed out of their alliance.  They will probably
attempt some stroke; I think not succeed in it, and then lie
by for an opportunity when they shall be stronger.  They can
only go to Holland, attempt these islands, or some great coup
in America.(657)  Holland they may swallow when they will;
yet, why should they, when we don't attempt to hinder them?
and it would be madness if -we did.  For coming hither, our
fleet is superior say, but equal: our army and preparations
greater than ever--if an invasion were still easy, should we
be yet to conquer, when we have been so long much more
exposed? In America we arc much stronger than they, and have
still more chances of preventing their performing any action
of consequence.

The opposition is nibbling, but is not popular, nor have Yet
got hold of any clue of consequence.  There is not the
vivacity that broke forth before the holidays.

I condole with you for Madame Antinori,(658) and Madame
Grifoni; but I know, my dear child, how much too seriously
your mind will be occupied about your dear brother, to think
that romantic grief will any longer disquiet you.  Pray
Heaven! I may send you better and better news.  Adieu!

P. S. I forgot to thank you for your history of the war with
Lucca in your last but one.

(657) "A formal declaration of war from France," writes Lord
Chesterfield to Mr. Dayrolles on the 23d, "seems to be the
natural consequence of Rouill`e's memorial.  I am not so fond
of war as I find many people are.  Mark the end on 't.  Our
treaty lately concluded with Russia is a fortunate event, and
secures the peace of the empire; and is it possible that
France can invade the Low Countries, which are the dominions
of the Empress Queen, only because Admiral Boscawen has taken
two of their ships in America?  I see but two places where
France can annoy us; in America, by slipping over in single
ships a considerable number of troops, and next by keeping us
in a state of fear and expense at home, with the threats and
appearances of an intended invasion."-E.

306 Letter 172
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 5, 1756.

I think I can give you a little better account of your
brother, who is so dear to both of us; I put myself on a foot
with you, for nothing can love him better than I do. I have
been a week at Strawberry Hill. in order to watch and see him
every day.  The Duke's physician, Dr. Pringle, who now attends
him, has certainly relieved him much: his cough is in a manner
gone, his fever much abated, his breath better.  His strength
is not yet increased; and his stitches, which they impute to
wind, are not relieved.  But both his physicians swear that
his lungs are not touched.  His worst symptom is what they
cannot, but I must and will remove: in short, his wife is
killing him, I can scarce say slowly.  Her temper is beyond
imagination, her avarice monstrous, her madness about what she
calls cleanliness, to a degree of distraction; if I had not
first, and then made your brother Ned interpose in form, she
would once or twice a week have the very closet washed in
which your brother sleeps after dinner.  It is certainly very
impertinent to interfere in so delicate a case, but your
brother's life makes me blind to every consideration: in
short, we have made Dr. Pringle declare that the moment the
weather is a little warmer, and he can be moved, change of air
is absolutely necessary, and I am to take him to Strawberry
Hill, where you may imagine he will neither be teased nor
neglected: the physicians are strong for his going abroad, but
I find that it will be a very difficult point to carry even
with himself.  His affairs are so extensive, that as yet he
will not hear of leaving them.  Then the exclusion of
correspondence by the war with France would be another great
objection with him to going thither; and to send him to Naples
by sea, if we could persuade him would hardly be advisable in
the heat of such hostilities.  I think by this account you
will judge perfectly of your brother's situation: you may
depend upon it, it is not desperate, and yet it is what makes
me very unhappy.  Dr. Pringle says, that in his life he never
knew a person for whom so many people were concerned.  I go to
him again to-morrow.

The war is reckoned inevitable, nay begun, though France does
not proceed to a formal declaration, but contents herself with
Monsieur Rouill`e's conditional declaration.  All intercourse
is stopped.  We, who two months ago were in terrors about a
war on the continent, are now more frightened about having it
at home.  Hessians and Dutch are said to be, and, I believe,
are sent for.  I have known the time when we were much less
prepared and much less alarmed.  Lord Ravensworth moved
yesterday to send par pr`eference for Hanoverians, but nobody
seconded him.  The opposition cavil, but are not strong enough
to be said to oppose.  This is exactly our situation.

I must beg, my dear sir, that you will do a little for my
sake, what I know and hear you have already done from natural
goodness.  Mr. Dick, the consul at Leghorn, is particularly
attached to my old and great friend Lady Harry Beauclerc, whom
you have often heard me mention; she was Miss Lovelace: it
will please me vastly if you will throw in a few civilities
more at my request.

Adieu! Pray for your brother: I need not say talk him over and
over with Dr. Cocchl, and hope the best of the war.




307 Letter 173
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Arlington Street, Feb. 12, 1756.

I will not write to my Lady Ailesbury to-night, nor pretend to
answer the prettiest letter in the world, when I am out of
spirits.  I am very unhappy about poor Mr. Mann, who I fear is
in a deep consumption: the doctors do not give him over, and
the symptoms are certainly a little mended this week; but you
know how fallacious that distemper is, and how unwise it would
be to trust to it! As he is at Richmond, I pass a great deal
of my time out of town to be near him, and so may have missed
some news; but I will tell you all I know.

The House of Commons is dwindled into a very dialogue between
Pitt and Fox-one even begins to want Admiral Vernon again for
variety.  Sometimes it is a little piquant; in which though
Pitt has attacked, Fox has generally had the better.  These
three or four last days we have been solely upon the
Pennsylvanian regiment, bickering, and but once dividing, 165
to 57.  We are got but past the first reading yet.  We want
the French to put a little vivacity into us.  The Duke of
Newcastle has expected them every hour: he was terribly
alarmed t'other night; on his table he found a mysterious card
with only these words, "Charles is very well, and is expected
in England every day."  It was plainly some secret friend that
advertised him of the pretender's approaching arrival.  He
called up all the servants, ransacked the whole house to know
who had been in his dressing-room:-at last it came out to be
an answer from the Duchess of Queensberry to the Duchess of
Newcastle about Lord Charles Douglas.  Don't it put you in
mind of my Lord Treasurer Portland in Clarendon, "Remember
Caesar"!

The French have promised letters of noblesse to whoever fits
out even a little privateer.  I could not help a melancholy
smile when my Lady Ailesbury talked of coming over soon.  I
fear major-general you will scarce be permitted to return to
your plough at Park-place, when we grudge every man that is
left at the plough.  Between the French and the earthquakes,
you have no notion how good we are grown; nobody makes a suit
of clothes now but of sackcloth turned up with ashes.  The
fast was kept so devoutly, that Dick Edgecumbe, finding a very
lean hazard at White's, said with a sigh, "Lord, how the times
are degenerated!  Formerly a fast would have brought every
body hither; now it keeps every body away!" A few nights
before, two men walking up the Strand, one said to t'other,
"Look how red the sky is!  Well, thank God! there is to be no
masquerade!"

My Lord Ashburnham(659) does not keep a fast; he is going to
marry one of the plump Crawleys:--they call him the noble lord
upon the woolsack.

The Duchess of Norfolk has opened her new house: all the earth
was there last Tuesday.  You would have thought there had been
a comet, every body was gaping in the air and treading on one
another's toes.  In short, you never saw such a scene of
magnificence and taste.  The tapestry, the embroidered bed,
the illumination, the glasses, the lightness and novelty of
the ornaments, and the ceilings, are delightful.  She gives
three Tuesdays, would you be at one!  Somebody asked my Lord
Rockingham afterwards at White's, what was there'! He said, ,
"Oh! there was all the company afraid of the Duchess, and the
Duke afraid of all the company."--It was not a bad picture.

My Lady Ailesbury flatters me extremely about my "World," but
it has brought me into a peck of troubles.  In short, the
good-natured town have been pleased to lend me a meaning, and
call my Lord Bute Sir Eustace.  I need not say how ill the
story tallies to what they apply it; but I do vow to you, that
so far from once entering into my imagination, my only
apprehension was that I should be suspected of flattery for
the compliment to the Princess in a former part.  It is the
more cruel, because you know it is just the thing in the world
on which one must not defend one's self.  If I might, I can
prove that the paper was writ last Easter, long before this
history was ever mentioned, and flung by, because I did not
like it: I mentioned it one night to my Lady Hervey, which was
the occasion of its being printed.

I beg you will tell my Lady Ailesbury, that I am sorry she
could not discover any wit in Mrs. Hussey's making a
sept-leva.  I know I never was so vain of any wit in my life
as winning a thousand leva and two five hundred levas.

You would laugh if you saw in the midst of what trumpery I am
writing.  Two porters have just brought home my purchases from
Mrs. Kennon the midwife's sale: Brobdignag combs, old broken
pots, pans, and pipkins, a lantern of scraped oyster-shells,
scimitars, Turkish pipes, Chinese baskets, etc. etc.  My
servants think my head is turned: I hope not: it is all to be
called the personal estate and moveables of my
great-great-grandmother, and to be reposited at Strawberry.  I
believe you think my letter as strange a miscellany as my
purchases.

P. S. I forgot, that I was outbid for Oliver Cromwell's
nightcap.

(659) John, second Earl of Ashburnham.  On the 28th of June he
married Elizabeth, daughter and coheiress of Ambrose Crawley,
Esq.-E.



309 Letter 174
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 23, 1756.

I can tell you with as much truth as pleasure that your brother
assuredly mends, and that his physician, Dr. Pringle, who is
the Duke's has told his Royal Highness, who expresses great
concern, that he now will live.  He goes out to take the air
every day, that is not very bad: Mr. Chute and I went to see
him yesterday, and saw a real and satisfactory alteration.  I
don't say this to flatter you; on the contrary, I must bid you,
my dear child, not to be too sanguine, for Dr.  Cocchi will
tell you that there is nothing more fallacious than a
consumptive case; don't mistake me, it is not a consumption,
though it is a consumptive disposition.  His spirits are
evidently better.

You will have heard, before you receive this, that the King of
France and Madame Pompadour are gone into devotion.  Some say,
that D'Argenson, finding how much her inclination for peace
with us fell in with the Monarch's humanity, (and winch indeed
is the only rational account one can give of their inactivity,)
employed the Cardinal de la Rochefoucault and the Confessor to
threaten the most Christian King with an earthquake if he did
not communicate at Easter; and that his Majesty accordingly
made over his mistress to his wife, by appointing the former
dame du palais: others, who refine more, pretend that Madame
Pompadour, perceiving how much the King's disposition veered to
devotion, artfully took the turn of humouring it, desired to be
only his soul's concubine, and actually sent to ask pardon of
her husband, and to offer to return to him, from which he
begged to be excused-the point in dispute is whether she has or
has not left off rouge.  In our present hostile state we cannot
arrive at any certainty on this important question; though our
fate seems to depend on it!

We have had nothing in Parliament but most tedious and long
debates on a West Indian regiment, to be partly composed of
Swiss and Germans settled in Pennsylvania, with some Dutch
officers.  The opposition neither increase in numbers or
eloquence; the want of the former seems to have damped the fire
of the latter.  the reigning fashion is expectation of an
invasion; I can't say I am fashionable; nor do I expect the
earthquake, though they say it is landed at Dover.

The most curious history that I have to tell you, is a
malicious, pretty successful, and yet most clumsy Plot executed
by the papists, in which number you will not be surprised at my
including some Protestant divines, against the famous
Bower,(660) author of the History of the Popes.  Rumours were
spread of his being discovered in correspondence with the
Jesuits; some even said the correspondence was treasonable, and
that he was actually in the hands of a messenger.  I went to
Sir George Lyttelton, his great friend, to learn the truth; he
told me the story: that Sir Harry Bedingfield, whom I know for
a most bigoted Papist in Norfolk, pretended to have six letters
from Bower (signed A. B.) in his hands, addressed to one Father
Sheldon, a Jesuit, under another name, in which A. B. affected
great contrition and desires of reconciliation to that church,
lamenting his living in fornication with a woman, by whom he
had a child, and from whom he had got fifteen hundred pounds,
which he had put into Sheldon's hands, and which he affirmed he
must have again if he broke off the commerce, for that the
woman insisted on having either him or her money; and offering
all manner of submission to holy church, and to be sent
wherever she should please; for non mea voluntas sed tua fiat:-
-the last letter grieved at not being able to get his money,
and to be forced to continue in sin, and concluded with telling
the Jesuit that something would happen soon which would put an
end to their correspondence-this is supposed to allude to his
history.  The similitude of hands is very great-but you know
how little that can weigh! I know that Mr. Conway and my Lady
Ailesbury write so alike, that I never receive a letter from
either of them that I am not forced to look at the name to see
from which it comes; the only difference is that she writes
legibly, and he does not.  These letters were shown about
privately, and with injunctions of secrecy: it seems Hooke, the
Roman historian, a convert to Popery, and who governs my Lord
Bath and that family, is deep in this plot.  At last it got to
the ears of Dr. Birch, a zealous but simple Than, and of Millar
the bookseller, angry at Bower for not being his printer--they
trumpeted the story all over the town.  Lord Pultney was One
who told it me, and added, "a Popish gentleman and an English
clergyman are upon the scent;" he told me Sir H. Bedingfield's
name, but Would not the clergyman's.  I replied, then your
lordship must give me leave to say, as I don't know his name,
that I suppose our doctor is as angry as Sir Harry at Bower for
having written against the church of Rome.  Sir G. Lyttelton
went to Sir Harry, and demanded to see the letters, and asked
for copies, which were promised.  He soon observed twenty
falsehoods and inconsistencies, particulary the mention of a
patent for a place, which Sir George obtained for him, but
never thought of asking till a year and a half after the date
of this letter; to say nothing of the inconsistence of his
taking a place as a Protestant, at the same time he was
offering to go whithersoever the Jesuits would send him; and
the still more glaring improbability of his risking himself
again under their power! Sir George desired the woman might be
produced--Sir Harry shuffled, and at last said he believed it
was a lie of Bower.  When he was beaten out of every point, he
said, he Would put it on this single fact, "Ask Mr. Bower if he
was not reconciled to the church of Rome in the year '44."  The
whole foundation proves to be this: Bower, who is a very child
in worldly matters, was weak enough, for good interest, to put
fifteen hundred pounds into the hands of one Brown, a Jesuit
here in London, and from that correspondence they have forged
his hand; and finding the minds of men alarmed and foolish
about the invasion and the earthquake, they thought the train
would take like wildfire.  I told Bower, that though this
trusting a Jesuit did great honour to his simplicity, it
Certainly did none to his judgment.  Sir George begged I would
advise them what to do-they were afraid to enter into a
controversy, which Hooke might manage.  I told him at once that
their best way would be to advertise a great reward for
discovery of the forgery, and to communicate their intention to
Sir Harry bedington.  Sir George was pleased with the
thought-and indeed it succeeded beyond expectation.  Sir Harry
sent word that he approved the investigation of truth, be the
persons concerned of what profession they would; that he was
obliged to go out of town next day for his health, but hoped at
his return Sir George would give him leave to cultivate an
acquaintance which this little affair had renewed.  Sir George
answered with great propriety and spirit, that he should be
very proud of his acquaintance, but must beg leave to differ
with him in calling a little affair what tended to murder a
man's character, but he was glad to see that it was the best
way that Rome had of answering Mr. Bower's book.  You see, Sir
Harry is forced to let the forgery rest on himself, rather than
put a chancellor of the exchequer upon the scent after priests!
He has even hesitated Upon giving Bower copies of the letters.

Since I began my letter, we hear that France is determined to
try a numerous invasion in several places in England and
Ireland, coute qui coute, and knowing how difficult it is.  We
are well-prepared and strong; they have given us time.  If it
were easy to invade us, we should not have waited for an attack
till the year 1756.  I hope to give you a good account both of
England and your brother.  Adieu!

generally believed that he intended to cheat the Jesuits out of
a sum of money.-D.

312 Letter 175
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Arlington Street, March 4, 1756.

Dear Harry,
I have received so kind and so long a letter from you, and so
kind too because so long, that I feel I shall remain much in
your debt, at least for length.  I won't allow that I am in
your debt for warmth of friendship.  I have nothing worth
telling you: we are hitherto conquered only in threat: for my
part.  I have so little expectation of an invasion, that I have
not buried a single enamel, nor bought a pane of painted glass
the less; of the two panics in fashion, the French and the
earthquake, I have not even made my option yet.  The opposition
get ground as little as either: Mr. Pitt talks by Shrewsbury
clock, and is grown almost as little heard as that is at
Westminster.  We have had full eight days on the Pennsylvania
regiment.  The young Hamilton has spoken and shone again; but
nothing is luminous compared with Charles Townshend:--he drops
down dead in a fit, has a resurrection, thunders in the
Capitol, confounds the treasury-bench, laughs at his own party,
is laid up the next day, and overwhelms the Duchess and the
good women that go to nurse him!  His brother's
Militia-bill(662) does not come on till next week: in the mean
time, he adorns the shutters, walls and napkins of every tavern
in Pall Mall with caricatures of the Duke(663) and Sir George
Lyttelton, the Duke of Newcastle and Mr. Fox.  Your friend
Legge has distinguished himself exceedingly on the supplies and
taxes, and retains all the dignity of chancellor of the
exchequer.  I think I never heard so complete a scene of
ignorance as yesterday on the new duties!  Except Legge, you
would not have thought there was a man in the House had learned
troy-weight; Murray quibbled--at Hume Campbell the House
groaned! Pitt and Fox were lamentable; poor Sir George never
knew prices from duties, nor drawbacks from premiums!  The
three taxes proposed were on plate, on bricks and tiles, on
cards and dice.  The earthquake has made us so good, that the
ministry might have burned the latter in Smithfield if they had
pleased.  The bricks they were forced to give up, and consented
graciously, to accept 70,000 pounds on alehouses, instead of
30,000 pounds on bricks.  They had nearly been forced to extend
the duty on plate beyond 10 pounds carrying the restriction by
a majority of only two.

An embargo is laid on the shipping, to get sailors.  The young
court lords were going to raise troops of light horse, but my
Lord Gower (I suppose by direction of the Duke) proposed to the
King that they should rather employ their personal interest to
recruit the army; which scheme takes place, and, as George
Townshend said in the House, they are all turning recruiting
sergeants.  But notwithstanding we so much expect a storm from
France, I am told that in France they think much more of their
own internal storms than of us.  Madame Pompadour wears
devotion, whether forced or artful is not certain: the disputes
between the King and the parliament run very high, and the Duke
of Orleans and the Prince of Conti have set themselves -,it the
head of the latter.  Old Nugent came fuddled to the Opera last
week, and jostled an ancient Lord Irwin, and then called him
fool for being in his way: they were going to fight; but my
Lord Talbot, professing that he did not care if they were both
hanged, advised them to go back and not expose themselves.  You
will stare perhaps at my calling Nugent old: it is not merely
to distinguish him from his son; but he is such a champion and
such a lover, that it is impossible not to laugh at him as if
he was a Methuselah! He is en affaire regime with the young
Lady Essex.  At a supper there a few nights ago of
two-and-twenty people, they were talking of his going to
Cashiobury to direct some alterations: Mrs. Nugent in the
softest infantine voice called out, "My Lady Essex, don't let
him do any thing out of doors; but you will find him delightful
within!"

I think I have nothing else to tell you but a bon-mot or two;
with that sort of news I think I take care to supply you duly.
I send you constantly the best that London affords.  Dick
Edgecumbe has said that his last child was born on
All-gamesters'-day; Twelfth-night.  This chapter shall conclude
with an epigram; the thought was George Selwyn's, who, you
know, serves all the epigram-makers in town with wit.  It is on
Miss Chudleigh crying in the drawing-room on the death of her
mother:-

"What filial piety! what mournful grace,
For a lost parent, sits on Chudleigh's face
Fair virgin, weep no more, your anguish smother!
You in this town can never want a mother."

I have told poor Mr. Mann how kind you are to him: indeed I
have been exceedingly frightened and troubled for him, and
thought him in immediate danger.  He is certainly much mended,
though I still fear a consumption for him; he has not been able
to move from Richmond this whole winter: I never fail to visit
him twice or thrice a week.  I heartily pity the fatigue and
dullness of your life; nor can I flatter you with pretending to
believe it will end soon: I hope you will not be forced to gain
as much reputation in the camp as you have in the cabinet!--You
see I must finish.

bill for better ordering the militia.  It passed the House of
Commons on the 10th of May.-E.

314 Letter 176
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 18, 1756.

I am not surprised to find by your letters of 21st and 28th of
February how much you have been alarmed for your brother.  You
have not felt more than I have: but I have the satisfaction of
seeing him mend, while you undergo the terrible suspense of
waiting for posts.  He has been pulled much back by the
operation of his quicksilver, which flung him into a severe
looseness and kind of salivation: it weakened him much and kept
him from the air, but it brought off a great load of black
stuff from his stomach, and his spirits are exceedingly better.
He is to go to the Bath as soon as he is able.  Would to heaven
I could prevail for his going to Italy, but he will not listen
to it.  You may be confident that I do not stop at mere decency
in checking his domestic torment--it is terrible; but when I
saw him in so much danger, I kept no measures-I went lengths
that would be inexcusable in any other situation.  No
description can paint the madness, (and when I call it madness,
I know I flatter) the preposterous unreasonableness and
infernal temper of that little white fiend! His temper, which
is equal to yours, bears him up under it.  I am with him two or
three mornings every week, and think I shall yet preserve him
for you.  The physicians are positive that his lungs are not
touched.

We proceed fiercely in armaments-yet in my own opinion, and I
believe the ministry think so too, the great danger is for Port
Mahon.  Admiral Bing sails directly for the Mediterranean.  The
Brest fleet that slipped away, is thought on its progress to
Nova Scotia.  The Dutch have excused sending us their troops on
the imminence of their own danger.  The parliamentary campaign
is almost over; you know I persist in believing that we shall
not have any other here.

Thank you much for your kindness to Mr. Dick; I will repay you
on your brother, though I don't know how to place him to any
account but my own.  If I could be more anxious than I am about
him, it would be, my dear child, on what you say to me on
yourself; but be comforted, all will yet be well.

Mr. Chute's picture is not yet arrived; when it comes, he shall
thank you himself.  I must now give you a new commission, and
for no less a minister than the chancellor of the exchequer.
Sir George Lyttelton desires that you will send him for his
hall the jesses of the Venus, the dancing Faun, the Apollo
Medicis, (I think there is a cast of it,) the Mercury, and some
other female statue, at your choice: he desires besides three
pair of Volterra vases, of the size to place on tables, and
different patterns.  consign the whole to me, and draw the bill
of lading on me.

I have nothing more to tell you but a naivet`e of my Lady
Coventry; the King asked her if she was not sorry that there
are no masquerades this year-(for you must know we have
sacrificed them to the idol earthquake,)-she said, no, she was
tired of them; she was surfeited with most sights; there was
but one left that she wanted to see--and that was a coronation!
The old man told it himself at supper to his family with a
great deal of good humour.  Adieu! my dear child.



315 Letter 177
315 Letter 177
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(664)
Arlington Street, March 25, 1756.

In spite of being sorry, as I certainly ought to be, when your
letters are short, I feel quite glad; I rejoice that I am not
much in your debt, when I have not wherewithal to pay.  Nothing
happens worth telling you: we have had some long days in the
House, but unentertaining; Mr. Pitt has got the gout in his
oratory, I mean in his head, and does not come out: we are sunk
quite into argument--but you know, when any thing is as it
should be, it is not worth talking of.  The plate-tax has made
some noise; the ministry carried one question on it but by
nine.  The Duke of Newcastle, who reserves all his heroism for
the war, grew frightened, and would have given up the tax; but
Mr. Fox bolstered up his courage and mustered their forces, and
by that and softening the tax till it was scarce worth
retaining, they carried the next question by an hundred.  The
day before yesterday the King notified the invasion to both
Houses, and his having sent for Hessians.  There were some
dislikes expressed to the latter; but, in general, fear
preponderated so much that the cry was for Hanoverians too.
Lord George Sackville, in a very artful speech, a little
maliciously even proposed them and noblemen's regiments: which
the Duke had rejected.  Lord Ravensworth, in the other House,
moved in form for Hanoverians; the Duke of Newcastle desired a
few days to consider it, and they are to go upon it in the
Lords to-morrow.  The militia, which had been dropped for next
year, is sprouted up again out of all this, and comes on
to-day.  But we should not be English, if we did not become
still more intent on a very trifle: we are.  A new road through
Paddington(665) has been proposed to avoid the stones: the Duke
of Bedford, who is never 'In town in summer, objects to the
dust it will make behind Bedford House, and to some buildings
proposed, though, if he was in town, he is too short-sighted to
see the prospect.  The Duke of Grafton heads the other side:
this is carried! you can imagine it---you could compose the
difference! you, grand corrupter, you who can bribe pomp and
patriotism, virtue and a Speaker,(666) you that have pursued
uprightness even to the last foot of land on the globe, and
have disarmed Whiggism almost on the banks of its own Boyne-
-don't you return hither, we shall have you attempt to debauch
even Mr. Onslow, who has preserved his chastity, while all the
band of chosen youths, while every Pultney, Pitt, and Lyttelton
have fallen around him.  I could not help laughing at the
picture of Malone bribed out of his virtue and mobbed into it
again!

Now I am in a serious strain, I will finish my letter with the
only other serious history I know.  My Lady Lincoln has given a
prodigious assembly to show the Exchequer house.(667)  She sent
to the porter to send cards to all she visited: he replied, he
could easily do that, for his lady visited nobody but Lady Jane
Scott.  As she has really neglected every body, many refusals
were returned.  The Duchess of Bedford was not invited, and
made a little opposition-supper, which was foolish enough.  As
the latter had refused to return my Lady Falmouth's visit, my
Lady Lincoln singled her out, visited and invited her.  The
dignity of the assembly was great- Westminster Hall was
illuminated for chairs; the passage from it hung with green
baize and lamps, and matted.  The cloister was the prettiest
sight in the world, lighted with lamps and Volterra vases.  The
great apartment is magnificent.  Sir Thomas Robinson the Long,
who you know is always propriety itself, told me how much the
house was improved since it was my brother's.  The Duchess of
Norfolk gives a great ball next week to the Duke of Cumberland:
so you see that she does not expect the Pretender, at least
this fortnight.  Last night, at my Lady Hervey's, Mrs. Dives
was expressing great panic about the French: my Lady Rochford,
looking down on her fan, said with great softness, "I don't
know, I don't think the French are a sort of people that women
need be afraid of." Adieu!

(664) Now first published.

(665) The Paddington or New Road, which the Duke of Bedford
opposed as making a dust behind Bedford House, and from some
intended buildings being likely to interrupt his prospect.  The
Duke of Grafton warmly espoused the other side of the question.

(667) Lord Lincoln was at this time auditor of the
exchequer.-E.



316 Letter 178
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Strawberry Hill, April 16, 1756.

You wrong me very much in thinking I omit writing because I
don't hear from you as often as you have a mind I should: you
are kinder to me in that respect than I have reason,
considering your numerous occupations, to expect: the real and
whole truth is, that I have had nothing to tell you; for I
could not tire either you or myself with all the details
relating to this foolish road-bill, which has engrossed the
whole attention of every body lately.  I have entered into it
less than any body.  What will you say when you are told that
proxies have been sent for to Scotland? that my Lord Harrington
has been dragged into the House of Lords from his coffin, and
Lord Arran(668) carried thither to take the oaths, who I
believe has not appeared there since the Revolution?  In short,
it has become quite a trial for power: and though the Dukes of
Grafton and Bedford have lent their names and their vehemence,
you will guess what has been the engine behind the curtain.

The French are so obliging as to wait till we have done with
these important squabbles: the House of Commons takes care too
not to draw off the attention of the nation.  The Militia-bill
has passed through that solitude, but I hear will be stopped in
the House of Lords.  I have lived lately in a round of great
disagreeable suppers, which you know are always called for my
Lady Yarmouth, as if the poor woman loved nothing but cramming:
I suppose it will so much become the etiquette, that in the
next reign there will be nothing but suppers for my Lord Bute.
I am now come hither to keep my Newmarket, but the weather is
cold and damp: it is uncertain whether the Duke makes that
campaign, or against the French.  As the road-bill extinguished
the violence about the two operas of next year, and they made
the invasion forgot, and the invasion the earthquake, I
foresee--and I go almost upon as sure grounds as prophets that
take care to let the event precede the prediction-I foresee
that the Hanoverians will swallow up all: they have already a
general named, who ranks before any one of ours; and there are
to be two Hanoverian aide-de-camps!

You will hear by this post of the death of Sir William Lowther,
whose vast succession falls to Sir James, and makes him
Croesus: he may hire the Dukes of Bedford and Marlborough for
led captains.  I am sorry for this young man, though I did not
know him; but it is hard to be cut off so young and so rich:
old rich men seldom deserve to live, but he did a thousand
generous acts.  You will be diverted with a speech of Lord
Shelburne,(669) one of those second-rate fortunes who have not
above five-and-thirty thousand pounds a year.  He says, every
body may attain some one point if they give all their attention
to it; for his part, he knows he has no great capacity, he
could not make a figure by his parts; he shall content himself
with being one of the richest men in England! I literally saw
him t'other day buying pictures for two-and-twenty shillings,
that I would not hang in my garret, while I, who certainly have
not made riches my sole point of view, was throwing away
guineas, and piquing myself for old tombstones against your
father-in-law the General.(670)  I hope Lady Ailesbury will
forgive my zeal for Strawberry against Coombank!  Are you never
to see your Strawberry Hill again'? Lord Duncannon flatters us
that we shall see you in May.  If I did not hope it, I would
send you the only two new fashionable pieces; a comic
elegy(671) by Richard Owen Cambridge, and a wonderful book by a
more wonderful author, Greville.(672)  It is called "Maxims and
Characters:" several of the former are pretty: all the latter
so absurd, that one in particular, which at the beginning you
take for the character of a man, turns out to be the character
of a postchaise.

You never tell me now any of Missy's bons-mots.  I hope she has
not resided in Ireland till they are degenerated into bulls?

318 Letter 179
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, April 18, 1756.

I wish I could send you accounts of your brother's amendment in
proportion to your impatience, and to my own: he does mend
certainly, but it is slowly: he takes the air every day, and
they talk of his riding, though I don't think him strong enough
yet to sit a horse; when he has rid a little he is to go to the
Bath.  I wish it much; for though he is at Richmond, there is
no keeping him from doing too much business.  Dr. Cocchi has
showed his usual sagacity: the case is pronounced entirely
asthmatic.  As they have acquitted him of a consumption, I feel
easy, though the complaint he has is so uneasy to himself'.
You must not be discouraged by my accounts; for I see your
brother so very often, that it is not possible for me to
discern the progress of alteration in him.

YOU Will not believe how little we have thought of the French
lately!  We are engaged in a civil war-not between St. James's
and Leicester House, but between the Dukes of Grafton and
Bedford, about a new turnpike-road on the back of the town: as
you may imagine, it grows politics; and if it is not
compromised during the recess, the French may march deep into
the kingdom before they become greater politics.

We think them not ready for Minorca, and that we shall be
prepared to receive them there.  The Hessians are expected
immediately; and soon after them the Hanoverians; and soon
after them many jealousies and uneasinesses.

These are all the politics I can tell you; and I have as little
else to tell you.  Poor Lady Drumlanrig(673) Whose lord
perished so unfortunately about a ear and a half ago, is dead
of a consumption from that shock; and Sir William Lowther, one
of the two heirs of old Sir James, died two days ago of a
fever.  He was not above six-and-twenty, master of above twenty
thousand pounds a-year - sixteen of which comes to young Sir
James, who was equally rich: think what a fortune is here
assembled-will any Florentine believe this when reduced to
sequins or scudi?

I receive such packets of thanks of Lady Harry Beauclerc,
transmitted to her from Mr. Dick, that you must bear to have
some of them returned to you.  I know you enough to believe
that you will be still better pleased with new trouble than
with my gratitude, therefore I will immediately flounce into
more recommendation; but while I do recommend, I must send a
bill of discount at the same time: in short, I have been
pressed to mention a Sir Robert Davers to you; but as I have
never seen him, I will not desire much more than your usual
civility for him; sure he may be content with that! I remember
Sir William Maynard,(674) and am cautious.

Since I began this, I receive yours of April 2d, full of
uneasiness for your brother's quicksilver and its effects.  I
did not mention it to you, because, though it put him back, his
physicians were persuaded that he would not suffer, and he has
not.  As to reasoning with them, my dear child, it is
impossible: I am more ignorant in physic than a child of six
years old; if it were not for reverence for Dr. Cocchi, and out
of gratitude to Dr. Pringle, who has been of such service to
your brother, I should say, I am as ignorant as a physician.  I
am really so sensible of the good your brother has received
from this doctor, that I myself am arrived so far towards being
ill, that I now know, if I was to be ill, who should be my
physician.  The weather has been so wet and cold that your
brother has received very little benefit from it: he talked to
me again this morning of riding but I don't yet think him able;
if you had seen him as I saw him the day I wrote my first
letter to you, you would be as happy as I am now: without that
I fear you would be shocked to see how he is emaciated; but his
eyes, his spirits, his attention, give me great hopes, though I
absolutely think it a tedious astigmatic case.  Adieu! my dear
child; be in better spirits, and don't expect either sudden
amendment or worse change.

319 Letter 180
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, April 20, 1756.

Your steward called on me just as I was going to keep my
Newmarket at Strawberry Hill; he promised to leave me the
direction to the statuary, but as I have not heard from him, I
wish you would send it me

The cold and the wet have driven me back to London, empty
London! where we are more afraid of the deluge than of the
invasion.  The French are said to be sailed for Minorca, which
I hold to be a good omen of their not coming hither; for if
they took England, Port Mahon, I should think, would scarcely
hold out.

Pray don't die, like a country body, because it is a fashion
for gentlefolks to die in London; it li's the bon ton now to
die; one can't show one's face without being a death's-head.
Mrs. Bethel and I are come strangely into fashion; but true
critics in mode object to our having underjaws, and maintain
that we are not dead comme il faut.  The young Lady Exeter(675)
died almost suddenly, and has handsomely confirmed her father's
will, by leaving her money to her lord only for his life, and
then to Thomas Townshend.(676)  Sir William Lowther has made a
charming will, and been as generous at his death as he was in
his short life; he has left thirteen legacies of five thousand
pounds each to friends; of which you know by sight,
Reynolds,(677) Mrs. Brudenel's son, (678) and young Turner.  He
has given seventeen hundred pounds a-year; that is, I suppose,
seventeen hundred Pounds, to old Mrs. Lowther.(679)  What an
odd circumstance! a woman passing an hundred years to receive a
legacy from a man of twenty-seven; after her it goes to Lord
George Cavendish.  Six hundred pounds per year he gives to
another Mrs. Lowther, to be divided afterwards between Lord
Frederick and Lord John.  Lord Charles, his uncle, is residuary
legatee.  But what do you think of young Mr. James Lowther, who
not of age becomes master of one or two and forty thousand
pounds a-year? England will become a heptarchy, the property of
six or seven people! The Duke of Bedford is fallen to be not
above the fourth rich man in the island.

Poor Lord Digby(680) is like to escape happily at last, after
being cut for the stone, and bearing the preparation and
execution with such heroism, that waking with the noise of the
surgeons, he asked if that was to be the day?  "Yes."--"How
soon will they be ready?"--"Not for some time."--"Then let me
sleep till they are?"  He was cut by a new instrument of
Hawkins, which reduces an age of torture to but one minute.

The Duke had appeared in form on the causeway in Hyde Park with
my lady Coventry: it is the new office, where all lovers are
entered.  How happy she must be with Billy and Bully!(681)  I
hope she will not mistake, and call the former by the nickname
of the latter.  At a great supper t'other night at Lord
Hertford's, if she was not the best-humoured creature in the
world, I should have made her angry: she said in a very vulgar
accent, if she drank any more, she should be muckibus.  "Lord!"
said Lady Mary Coke, "what is that?"-"Oh! it is Irish for
sentimental."

There is a new Morocco ambassador, who declares for Lady
Caroline Petersham, preferably to Lady Coventry.  Lady Caroline
Fox says he is the best bred of all the foreign ministers, and
at one dinner said more obliging things than Mirepoix did
during his whole embassy.  He is so fashionable, that George
Selwyn says he is sure my lady Winchelsea will ogle him instead
of Haslang.

I shall send you soon the fruits of my last party to
Strawberry; Dick Edgcumbe, George Selwyn, and Williams were
with me: we composed a coat of arms for the two clubs at
White's, which is actually engraving from a very pretty
painting of Edgcumbe, whom Mr. Chute, as Strawberry king at
arms, has appointed our chief herald painter; here is the
blazon:

Vert (for card-table,) between three -parolis proper on a
chevron table (for hazard-table) two rouleaus in saltire
between two dice proper: in a canton, sable, a white ball (for
election) argent.

Supporters.  An old knave of clubs on the dexter; a young knave
on the sinister side; both accoutred proper.

Crest.  Issuing out of an earl's coronet (Lord Darlington) an
arm shaking a dice-box, all proper.

Motto. (Alluding to the crest,) Cogit amor nummi.  The arms
encircled by a claret bottle ticket, by way of order.

By the time I hope to see you at Strawberry Hill, there will be
a second volume of the Horatiana ready for the press; or a full
and true account of the bloody civil wars of the house of
Walpole, being a narrative of the unhappy differences between
Horatio and Horace Walpoles; in short, the old wretch, who
aspires to be one of the heptarchy, and who I think will live
as long as old Mrs. Lowther, has accomplished such a scene of
abominable avarice and dirt, that I, notwithstanding my desire
to veil the miscarriages of my race, have been obliged to drag
him and all his doings into light-but I won't anticipate.

321 Letter 181
To George Montagu, Esq.
May 12.

Don't imagine I write to you for any thing but form; there is
nothing like news, except the Prussian victories, which you see
in the papers: by next courier we expect he will send us at
least a leg or an arm of the Empress Queen.

Our domestic politics are far from settled.  The King is gone
to Kensington, and when any ministry can be formed, it is to be
sent after him.  The Parliament draggles on, till any two of
the factions can unite.  I have not got my tickets yet, but
will certainly reserve what you want.  Adieu!



322 Letter 182
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, May 16, 1756.

You will hear with great satisfaction that your brother rides
out every day, and bears it pretty well.  I sent to him
yesterday morning, and my Swiss boy told me with great joy at
his return, that he saw your brother's servants cutting a plate
of bread and butter for him, big enough, said he, for you, Sir,
and Mr. Bentley, and Mr. Muntz--who is a Swiss painter that I
keep in the house--you perceive I deal much in Swiss.  I saw
your brother this morning myself; he does not mend so fast as I
wish, but I still attribute it to the weather.  I mentioned to
him Dr. Cocchi's desire of seeing his case and regimen in
writing by Dr. Pringle, but I found he did not care for it; and
you may imagine I would not press it.  I sifted Dr. Pringle
himself, but he would not give me a positive answer: I fear he
still thinks that it is not totally an asthma.  If you had seen
him so much worse, as I have, you would be tolerably comforted
now.  Lord Malpas(682) saw him to-day for the first time, and
told me alone that he found him much better than he expected.
His spirits and attention to every thing are just as good as
ever, which was far from being the case three months ago.

I read the necessary part of your letter to Sir George
Lyttelton, who thinks himself much obliged, and leaves the
vases entirely to your taste, and will be fully content with
the five jesses you name.

We have nothing new; the Parliament rises the 25th: all our
attention is pointed to Minorca, of which you must be much
better and sooner informed than we can.  Great dissatisfactions
arise about the defenceless state in which it was left; it is
said, some account arrived from Commodore Edgcumbe(683) the
night before last, but it is kept very secret, which at least
specifies the denomination of it.  I hope to find Mr. Conway in
town to-morrow night, whither he is just returned from Ireland;
he has pacified that country to the standard of his own
tranquillity.

I have read the poem you mention, the Pucelle, and am by no
means popular, for I by no means like it-it is as tiresome as
if it was really a heroic poem.  The four first cantos are by
much the best, and throughout there are many vivacities; but so
absurd, perplexed a story is intolerable; the humour often
missed, and even the parts that give most offence, I think very
harmless.

P. S. We are to declare war this week; I suppose, in order to
make peace, as we cannot make peace till we have made war.

323 Letter 183
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 19, 1756.

Nothing will be more agreeable to me than to see you at
Strawberry Hill; the weather does not seem to be of my mind,
and will not invite you.  I believe the French have taken the
sun.  Among other captures, I hear the King has taken another
English mistress. a Mrs. Pope, who took her degrees in
gallantry some years ago.  She went  to Versailles with the
famous Mrs. quon: the King took notice of them; he was told
that they were not so rigid as all other English women are-
-mind, I don't give you any part of this history for authentic;
you know we can have no news from France but what we run.  I
have rambled so that I forgot what I intended to say; if ever
we can have spring, it must be soon; I propose to expect you
any day you please after Sunday se'nnight, the 30th: let me
know your resolution, and pray tell me in what magazine is the
Strawberry ballad?  I should have proposed an earlier day to
you, but next week the Prince of Nassau is to breakfast at
Strawberry Hill, and I know your aversion to clashing with
grandeur.

As I have already told you one mob story of a king, I will tell
you another: they say, that the night the Hanover troops were
voted, he sent Schutz(684) for his German cook, and said, "Get
me a very good supper; get me all de varieties; I don't mind
expense."

I tremble lest his Hanoverians should be encamped at Hounslow;
Strawberry would become an inn; all the Misses would breakfast
there, to go and see the camp!

My Lord Denbigh,(685) is going to marry a fortune, I forget her
name; my Lord Gower asked him how long the honeymoon would
last? He replied, "Don't tell me of the honeymoon; it is
harvest moon with me."  Adieu!

323 Letter 184
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 27, 1756.

Your brother is determined to go to Bristol in ten days: our
summer, which nobody but the almanack has the confidence to say
is not winter, is so cold that he does not advance at all.  If
his temper was at all in the power of accidents, it would be
affected enough just now to affect his health! What a figure we
would make in a catalogue of philosophers or martyrs!  His
wife's aunt, Mrs. Forth, who has always promised him the half
of her fortune, which is at least thirty thousand pounds, is
dead, and has left him only two thousand pounds.  He sent for
your brother Ned this morning to talk to him upon some other
business, and it was with such unaffected cheerfulness, that
your eldest brother concluded he was reserving the notification
of a legacy of at least ten thousand pounds for the bonne
bouche; but he can bear his wife, and then what are
disappointments? Pray, my dear child, be humble, and don't
imagine that yours is the only best temper in the world.  I
pretend so little to a good one, that it is no merit in me to
be out of all patience.

My uncle's ambition and dirt are crowned at last: he is a
peer.(686)  Lord Chief Justice Ryder, who was to have kissed
hands with him on Monday, was too ill, and died on
Tuesday;(687) but I believe his son will save the peerage.

We know nothing yet of Minorca, and seem to think so little of
our war, that to pass away his time, Mars is turned Impresario:
in short, the Duke has taken the Opera-house for the ensuing
season.  There has been a contest between the manager Vanneschi
and the singers Mingotti and Ricciarelli;(688) the Duke
patronizes the Mingotti and lists under her standard.  She is a
fine singer, an admirable actress; I cannot say her temper is
entirely so sweet as your brother's.

May 30th, Arlington Street,

See what a country gentleman I am! One cannot stir ten miles
from London without coming to believe what one hears, and
without supposing that whatever should be done, will be done.
The Opera-house is still in dispute between Signor Guglielmo
and Signor Vanneschi--and Mr. Ryder(689) will not get the
peerage; for coronets are not forfeited by worthlessness, but
by misfortune.  My lord Chief Justice misses one by only dying,
my uncle gets one by living!

I this moment receive your letter of the 15th.  We had picked
up by scrambling accounts pretty much what you tell me of
Minorca; but hitherto we only live on comparing dates.

I can add nothing to what I have said in the article of your
brother.  I am going to send the papers to Lord
Macclesfield.(690)  Adieu!

P. S. It is uncertain who will be Chief Justice; Murray could
have no competitor, but the Duke of Newcastle cannot part with
him from the House of Commons.(691)

(686) Through the zeal of his friend Lord Hardwicke, and the
influence of the Cavendish party, the repugnance of the King
was overcome, and Horatio Walpole, on the 1st of June, was
elevated to the peerage, by the title of Lord Walpole of
Wolterton.-E.

(687) On the 24th of May, the King signed a warrant for raising
Sir Dudley Ryder to the peerage, but he died before the patent
was completed.-E.


(688) "Vanneschi's difference with Mingotti occasioned as many
private quarrels and public feuds as the disputed abilities of
Handel and Bononcini, or the talents of Faustina and Cuzzoni,
had done thirty years before.  On a toujours tort in these
disputes; and addressing the town is but making bad worse: for
not a word which either party says is believed.  These
squabbles ended in Vanneschi's being a bankrupt, a prisoner in
the Fleet, and afterwards a fugitive; and in Mingotti's
acquiring for a while the sovereignty in the Opera kingdom, by
which gratification of ambition they were soon brought to the
brink of ruin, as others had been before them." Burney.-E.

Attorney-General's private friends thought the office, on every
account, so fit for him, that it would be infatuation to
decline it, and that the Attorney-General himself was of the
same opinion, but the Duke of Newcastle was frightened at the
thoughts of what was to become of the House of Commons."

325 Letter 185
To The Earl Of Strafford.(692)
Strawberry Hill, June 6, 1756.

My dear lord,
I am not sorry to be paving my way to Wentworth Castle by a
letter, where I suppose you are at this time, and for which I
waited: it is not that I stayed so long before I executed my
embassy aupr`es de Milord Tylney.  He had but one pair of gold
pheasants at present, but promises my Lady Strafford the first
fruits of their loves.  He gave me hopes of some pied peacocks
sooner, for which I asked directly, as one must wait for the
lying-in of the pheasants.  If I go on negotiating so
successfully, I may hope to arrive at a peerage a little sooner
than my uncle has.

As your Lordship, I know, is so good as to interest yourself in
the calamities of your friends, I will, as shortly as I can,
describe and grieve your heart with a catastrophe that has
happened to two of them.  My Lady Ailesbury, Mr. Conway, and
Miss Rich passed two days last week at Strawberry Hill.  We
were returning from Mrs. Clive's through the long field, and
had got over the high stile that comes into the road; that is,
three of us.  It had rained, and the stile was wet.  I could
not let Miss Rich straddle across so damp a palfrey, but took
her in my arms to lift her over.  At that instant I saw a coach
and six come thundering down the hill from my house; and
hurrying to set down my charge, and stepping backwards, I
missed the first step, came down headlong with the nymph in my
arms; but turning quite round as we rushed to the ground, the
first thing that touched the earth was Miss Rich's head.  You
must guess in how improper a situation we fell; and you must
not tell my Lady Strafford before any body that every
petticoat, etc. in the world were canted high enough indeed!
The coach came on, and never stopped.  The apprehension that it
would run over my Chloe made me lie where I was, holding out my
arm to keep off the horses, which narrowly missed trampling us
to death.  The ladies, who were Lady Holderness, Miss Pelham,
and your sister Lady Mary Coke, stared with astonishment at the
theatre which they thought I had chosen to celebrate our loves;
the footmen laughed; and you may imagine the astonishment of
Mr. Conway and Lady Ailesbury, who did not see the fall, but
turned and saw our attitude.  It was these spectators that
amazed Miss Pelham, who described the adventure to Mrs. Pitt,
and said, "What was most amazing, there were Mr. Conway and
Lady Ailesbury looking on!" I shall be vexed to have told you
this long story, if Lady Mary has writ it already; only tell
in@ honestly if she has described it as decently as I have.

If you have not got the new Letters and Memoirs of Madame
Maintenon, I beg I may recommend them for your summer reading.
As far as I have got, which is but into the fifth volume of the
Letters, I think you will find them very curious, and some very
entertaining.  The fourth volume has persuaded me of the
sincerity of' her devotion; and two or three letters at the
beginning of my present tome have made me even a little jealous
for my adored Madame de S`evign`e.  I am quite glad to find
that they do not continue equally agreeable.  The extreme
misery to which France was reduced at the end of Queen Anne's
war, is more striking than one could conceive.  I hope it is a
debt that they are not going to pay, though the news that
arrived on Wednesday have but a black aspect.  The
consternation on the behaviour of Byng,(693) and on the amazing
Council of war at Gibraltar,(694) is extreme; many think both
next to impossibilities.  In the mean time we fear the loss of
Minorca.  I could not help smiling t'other day at two passages
in Madame Maintenon's Letters relating to the Duc de Richelieu,
when he first came into the world: "Jamais homme n'a mieux
r`eussi `a la cour, la premi`ere fois qu'il y a paru: c'est
r`eellement une tr`es-jolie cr`eature!"  Again:--"C'est la plus
aimable poup`ee qu'on puisse voir."  How mortifying that this ,
jolie poup`ee should be the avenger Of the Valoises!

Adieu! my lord.  I don't believe that a daughter of the Duke of
Argyle(695) will think that the present I have announced in the
first part of my letter balances the inglorious article in the
end.  I wish you would both renew the breed of heroes, which
seems scarcer than that of gold pheasants!

(692) William Wentworth, second Earl of Strafford, of the
second creation.  He married Lady Anne Campbell, second
daughter of John, second Duke of Argyle, and died in 1791.-E.

(693) Hon.  John Byng, fourth son of Admiral Byng; a
distinguished officer, who, for his eminent services, was
created Viscount Torrington in 1721.-E.

(694) A council of war was held at Gibraltar, to decide upon a
request made by Admiral Byng for a reinforcement of troops from
that garrison for the defence of Minorca; where M. de la
Galissoni`ere, with thirteen sail of the line and several
transports, had, towards the end of April, landed a large body
of land forces under the command of the Duc de Richelieu.-E.

(695) Lady Strafford was the youngest daughter of John Duke of
Argyle.



327 Letter 186
To John Chute, Esq.(696)
Arlington Street, June 8, 1756.

My dear sir,
Pray have a thousand masses said in your divine chapel `a
l'intention of your poor country.  I believe the occasion will
disturb the founder of it, and make him shudder in his shroud
for the ignominy of his countrymen.  By all one learns, Byng,
Fowke, and all the officers at Gibraltar, were infatuated!
They figured Port Mahon lost, and Gibraltar a-going! a-going!
Lord Effingham, Cornwallis, Lord Robert Bertie, all, all signed
the council of war, and are in as bad odour as possible.  The
King says It will be his death, and that he neither eats nor
sleeps--all our trust is in Hanoverians.

The Prince has desired to be excused living at Kensington, but
accepts of 40,000 pounds a year; 5,000 pounds is given to
Prince Edward, and an establishment is settling; but that too
will meet with difficulties.  I will be more circumstantial
when we Meet.(697)

My uncle has chose no motto nor supporters yet: one would think
there were fees to pay for them! Mr. Fox said to him, "Why
don't you take your family motto?"  He replied, "Because my
nephew would say I think I speak as well as my brother."  I
believe he means me.  I like his awe.  The Duke of Richmond,
taking me for his son, reproached himself to Lady Caroline Fox
for not wishing me joy.  She is so sorry she undeceived him!
Charles Townshend has turned his artillery upon his own court:
he says, "Silly fellow for silly fellow, I don't see why it is
not as well to be governed by my uncle with a blue riband, as
by my cousin with a green one."

I have passed to-day one of the most agreeable days of my life;
your righteous spirit will be offended with me-but I must tell
you: my Lord and Lady Bath carried my Lady Hervey and me to
dine with my Lady Allin at Blackheath.  What added to the
oddness of the company in which I found myself was her sister
Mrs. Cleveland, whose bitterness against my father and uncle
for turning out her husband you have heard--but she is very
agreeable.  I had a little private satisfaction in very
naturally telling my Lord Bath how happy I have made his old
printer, Franklyn.  The Earl was in extreme good-humour,
repeated epigrams, ballads, anecdotes, stories, which, as
Madame S`evign`e says, put one in mind " "de sa d`efunte
veine."  The Countess was not in extreme good-humour, but in
the best-humoured ill-humour in the world; contested every
thing with great drollery, and combated Mrs. Cleveland on
Madame Maintenon's character, with as much satire and knowledge
of the world as ever I heard in my life.  I told my Lord Bath
General Wall's foolish vain motto, "Aut Caesar aut nihil."  He
replied, "He is an impudent fellow; he should have taken 'Murus
aheneus.'"  Doddington has translated well the motto on the
caps of the Hanoverians, "Vestigia nulla retrorsum."  "They
never mean to go back again."

Saunders, the new admiral, told the King yesterday in a very
odd phrase, that they should scren his heart out, if Byng is
not now in the harbour of Mahon.  The world condemns extremely
the rashness of superseding admirals on no information but from
our enemies.  The ministry tremble for Thursday se'nnight
(inter alia), when the King is to desire the Parliament to
adjourn again.  I believe altogether it will make a party.
Adieu!

(696) Now first printed.


(697) "June 6. I heard that a message in writing had been sent
to the Prince, from the King offering him an allowance of
40,000 pounds a year, and an apartment in the palaces of
Kensington and St. James's.  The answer was full of high
gratitude for the allowance, but declining the apartment, on
account of the mortification it would be to his mother; though
it is well known that he does not live with her, either in town
or country."  Doddington, p. 345.-E.



328 Letter 187
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 14, 1756.

Our affairs have taken a strange turn, my dear Sir, since I
wrote to you last at the end of May; we have been all
confusion, consternation, and resentment!  At this moment we
are all perplexity!  When we were expecting every instant that
Byng would send home Marshal Richelieu's head to be placed upon
Temple-bar, we were exceedingly astonished to hear that the
governor and garrison of Gibraltar had taken a panic for
themselves, had called a council of war, and in direct
disobedience to a positive command, had refused Byng a
battalion from thence.  This council was attended, and their
resolution signed, by all the chief officers there, among whom
are some particular favourites, and some men of the first
quality.  Instead of being shocked at this disappointment, Byng
accompanied it with some wonderful placid letters, in which he
notified his intention of retiring under the cannon of
Gibraltar, in case he found it dangerous to attempt the relief
of Minorca! These letters had scarce struck their damp before
D'Abreu, the Spanish minister, received an account from France,
that Galissoni`ere had sent word that the English fleet had
been peeping about him, with exceeding caution, for two or
three days; that on the 20th of May they had scuffled for about
three hours, that night had separated them, and that to his
great astonishment, the English fleet, of which he had not
taken one vessel. had disappeared in the morning.  If the world
was scandalized at this history, it was nothing to the
exasperation of the court, who, on no other foundation than an
enemy's report, immediately ordered Admiral Hawke and Saunders
[created an admiral on Purpose] to bridle and saddle the first
ship at hand, and post away to Gibraltar, and to hang and drown
Byng and West, and then to send them home to be tried for their
lives: and not to be too partial to the land, and to be as
severe upon good grounds as they were upon scarce any, they
despatched Lord Tyrawley and Lord Panmure upon the like errand
over the Generals Fowke and Stuart.  This expedition had so far
a good effect, that the mob itself could i)ot accuse the
ministry of want of rashness; and luckily for the latter, in
three days more the same canal confirmed the disappearance of
the English fleet for four days after the engagement--but
behold! we had scarce had time to jumble together our sorrow
for our situation, and our satisfaction for the despatch we had
used to repair it, when yesterday threw us into a new puzzle.
Our spies, the French, have sent us intelligence that
Galissoni`ere is disgraced, recalled, and La Motte sent to
replace him, and that Byng has reinforced the garrison of St.
Philip's(698) with--150 men!  You, who are nearer the spot, may
be able, perhaps, to unriddle or unravel all this confusion;
but you have no notion how it has put all your politics
aground!

This is not our only quandary! A message of 40,000 pounds
a-year, with an intention of an establishment for a court, and
an invitation of coming to live at Kensington, has been sent to
Leicester-fields.  The money was very kindly received--the
proposal of leaving our lady-mother refused in most submissive
terms.  It is not easy to enforce obedience; yet it is not
pleasant to part with our money for nothing--and yet it is
thought that will be the consequence of this ill-judged step of
authority.  My dear child, I pity you who are to represent and
to palliate all the follies of your country!

My uncle has got his peerage: but just when the patent was
ready my Lord Privy Seal Gower went out of town, on which the
old baby wrote him quite an abusive letter, which my Lord Gower
answered with a great deal of wit and severity.  Lord
Ilchester(699) and Lord Falconberg(700) are created earls.

General Isemberg of the Hessians has already diverted us: he
never saw the tide till he came to Southampton; he was alarmed,
and seeing the vessel leaning on the shore, he sent for his
master of the horse, and swore at him for overturning the ship
in landing the horses.  Another of them has challenged a
Hampshire justice, for committing one of his soldiers; but
hitherto both Hessians and Hanoverians are rather popular.

Your brother, whom, if any thing, I think better, is set out
this morning for Bristol.  You cannot pray more for its
restoring his health than I do.  I have just received yours of
May 28th, to which I make no answer, as all the events I have
mentioned are posterior to your accounts.  Adieu! my dear Sir.

(698) In the month of June 1756, the Marshal de Richelieu, at
the head of sixteen thousand men, landed in Minorca, and almost
immediately obtained possession of the whole island, as well as
of the fortress of St. Philip and Port Mahon, the population
joining him; and the garrison, commanded by General Blakeney,
being very weak, and not having received the expected succours
from Admiral Byng.-D.

Sir Stephen Fox.  His titles were given him, with remainder, in
failure of issue male of himself, to his younger brother, Henry

Fauconberg.  He died in 1774.-D.



330 Letter 188
To George Montagu, Esq.
June 18.

The two drawings of the Vine and Strawberry, which you desired,
are done. and packed up in a box; tell me how I must send them.
The confusion about the ministry is not yet settled; at least
it was not at noon to-day; but, for fear that confusion should
ever finish, all the three factions are likely to come into
place together.  Poor Mr. Chute has had another bad fit; he
took the air yesterday for the first time.  I came to town but
last night, and returned to my chateau this evening knowing
nothing but that we are on the crisis of battles and
ministries.  Adieu!

P. S. I just hear that your cousin Halifax has resigned, on
Pitt's not letting him be secretary of state for the West
Indies.



330 Letter 189
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, July 11, 1756.

I receive with great satisfaction all your thanks for my
anxiety about your brother: I love you both so much, that
nothing can flatter me more, than to find I please the one by
having behaved as I ought to the other--oh, yes! I could be
much more rejoiced, if this brother ceased to want my
attentions.  Bristol began to be of service to him.  but he has
caught cold there, and been out of order again: he assures me
it is over.  I will give you a kind of happiness: since he was
there, he tells me, that if he does not find all the benefit he
expects, he thinks of going abroad.  I press this most eagerly,
and shall drive it on, for I own if he stays another winter in
England, I shall fear his disorder will fix irremovably.  I
will give you a commission, which, for his sake, I am sure, you
will be attentive to execute in the perfectest manner.  Mr. Fox
wants four vases of the Volterra alabaster, of four feet high
each.  I choose to make over any merit in it to you, and though
I hate putting you to expense, at which you always catch so
greedily, when it is to oblige, yet you shall present these.
Choose the most beautiful patterns, look to the execution, and
send them with rapidity, with such a letter as your turn for
doing civil things immediately dictates.

There is no describing the rage against Byng; for one day we
believed him a real Mediterranean Byng.(701)  He has not
escaped a sentence of abuse, by having involved so many
officers in his disgrace and his councils of war: one talks
coolly of their being broke, and that is all.  If we may
believe report, the siege is cooled' into a blockade, and we
may still save Minorca, and, what I think still more of dear
old Blakeney.(702)  What else we shall save or lose I know not.
The French, we hear, are embarked at Dunkirk--rashly, if to
come hither; if to Jersey or Guernsey, uncertain of success if
to Ireland, ora pro vobis!  The Guards are going to encamp.  I
am sorry to say, that with so much serious war about our ears,
we can't help playing with crackers.  Well, if the French do
come, we shall at least have something for all the money we
have laid out on Hanoverians and Hessians!  The latter, on
their arrival. asked bonnement where the French camp was.  They
could not conceive being sent for if it was no nearer than
Calais.

The difficulties in settling the Prince's family are far from
surmounted; the council met on Wednesday night to put the last
hand to it, but left it as unsettled as ever.

Pray do dare to tell me what French and Austrians say of their
treaty: we are angry--but when did subsidies purchase
gratitude!  I don't think we have always found that they even
purchased temporary assistance.  France declared, Sweden and
Denmark allied to France, Holland and Austria neuter, Spain not
quite to be depended on, Prussia--how sincerely reconciled!
Would not one think we were menaced with a league of Cambray?
When this kind of situation was new to me, I did not like it-I
have lived long enough, and have seen enough, to consider all
political events as mere history, and shall go and see the
camps with as unthinking curiosity as if I were a simpleton or
a new general.  Adieu!

(701) His father, Lord Torrington, had made a great figure
there against the Spaniards.

(702) It was at that time believed that General Blakeney had
acted with great spirit; but it appeared afterwards that he had
been confined to his bed, and had not been able to do any
thing.



331 Letter 190
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 12, 1756.

When I have told you that Mr. Muntz has finished the drapery of
your picture, and the copy of it, and asked you whither and how
they must be sent, I think I have done all the business of my
letter; except telling you, that if you think of conveying them
through Moreland, he is gone a soldiering.  All the world is
going the same road, except Mr. Muntz, who had rather be
knocked on the head for fame, than paint for it.  He goes to
morrow to Kingston, to see the great drum pass by to Cobham, as
women go to take a last look of their captains.  The Duke of
Marlborough, and his grandfather's triumphal car are to close
the procession.  What would his grandame, if she were alive,
say to this pageant? If the war lasts, I think well enough of
him to believe he will earn a sprig; but I have no passion for
trying on a crown of laurel, before I had acquired it.  The
French are said to be embarked at Dunkirk--lest I should seem
to know more than any minister, I will not pretend to guess
whither they are bound.  I have been but one night in town, and
my head sung ballads about Admiral Byng all night, as one is
apt to dream of the masquerade minuet: the streets swarm so
with lampoons, that I begin to fancy myself a minister's son
again.

I am going to-morrow to Park-place; and the first week in
August into Yorkshire.  If I hear that you are at Greatworth,
that is, if you will disclose your motions to me for the first
fortnight of that month, I will try if I cannot make it in my
road either going or coming.  I know nothing of roads, but Lord
Strafford is to send me a route, and I should be glad to ask
you do for one night--but don't expect me, don't be
disappointed about me, and of all things don't let so uncertain
a scheme derange the least thing in the world that you have to
do.  There are going to be as many camps and little armies, as
when England was a heptarchy.  Adieu!



 332 Letter 191
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, July 24, 1756.

Because you desire it, I begin a letter to-day, but I don't
fancy I shall be able to fill to the bottom of this side.  It
is in answer to your long one of the 3d.  In answer?--no; you
must have Patience till next session before your queries can
be resolved, and then I believe you will not be very
communicative of the solutions.  In short, all your questions
of, Why was not Byng sent sooner? Why not with more ships? Why
was Minorca not supported earlier? All these are questions
which all the world is asking as well as you, and to which all
the world does not make such civil answers as you must, and to
which I shall make none, as I really know none.(703)  The
clamour is extreme, and I believe how to reply in Parliament
will be the chief business that will employ our ministry for
the rest of the summer--perhaps some such home and personal
considerations were occupying their thoughts in the winter,
when they ought to have been thinking of the Mediterranean.
We are still in the dark; we have nothing but the French
account of the surrender of St. Philip's: we are humbled,
disgraced, angry.  We know as little of Byng, but hear that he
sailed with the reinforcement before his successor reached
Gibraltar. if shame, despair, or any human considerations can
give courage, he will surely contrive to achieve some great
action, or to be knocked on the head--a cannon-ball must be a
pleasant quietus. compared to being torn to pieces by an
English mob or a House of Commons.  I know no other
alternative, but withdrawing to the Queen of Hungary, who
would fare little better if she were obliged to come hither--
we are extremely disposed to massacre somebody or other, to
show we have any courage left.  You will be pleased with a
cool, sensible speech of Lord Granville to Coloredo, the
Austrian minister, who went to make a visit of excuses.  My
Lord Granville interrupted him, and said, "Sir, this is not
necessary; I understand that the treaty is only of neutrality;
but what grieves me is, that our people will not understand it
so; and the prejudice will be so great, that when it shall
become necessary Again, as it will do, for us to support your
mistress, nobody will then dare to be a Lord Granville."

I think all our present hopes lie in Admiral Boscawen's
intercepting the great Martinico fleet of a hundred and fifty
sail, convoyed by five men-of-war Boscawen has twenty.  I see
our old friend Prince Beauvau behaved well at Mahon.  Our old
diversion, the Countess,(704) has exhibited herself lately to
the public exactly in a style you would guess.  Having
purchased and given her lord's collection of statues to the
University of Oxford, she has been there at the public act to
receive adoration.  A box was built for her near the
Vice-Chancellor, where she sat three days together for four
hours at a time to hear verses and speeches, to hear herself
called Minerva; nay, the public orator had prepared an
encomium on her beauty, but being struck with her appearance,
had enough presence of mind to whisk his compliments to the
beauties of her mind.  Do but figure her; her dress had all
the tawdry poverty and frippery with which you remember her,
and I dare swear her tympany, scarce covered with ticking,
produced itself through the slit of her scowered damask robe.
It is amazing that she did not mash a few words of Latin, as
she used to fricasee French and Italian! or that she did not
torture some learned simile, like her comparing the tour of
Sicily, the surrounding the triangle, to squaring the circle;
or as when she said it was as difficult to get into an Italian
coach, as for Caesar to take Attica, which she meant for
Utica.  Adieu! I trust by his and other accounts that your
brother mends.

P. S. The letters I mentioned to you, pretended to be Bower's,
are published, together with a most virulent pamphlet, but
containing affidavits, and such strong assertions of facts as
have staggered a great many people. His escape and account of
himself' in Italy is strongly questioned.  I own I am very
impatient for the answer he has promised.  I admire his book
so much, and see such malice in his accusers, that I am
strongly disposed to wish and think him a good man.  Do, for
my private satisfaction, inquire and pick up all the anecdotes
you can relating to him, and what is said and thought of him
in Italy.  One accusation I am sure is false, his being a
plagiary; there is no author from whom he could steal that
ever wrote a quarter so well.

(703) "However the case may be with regard to Byng," writes
Mr. George Grenville to Mr. Pitt, on the first intelligence of
the disaster, "what can be the excuse for sending a force,
which at the utmost is scarcely equal to the enemy, upon so
important and decisive an expedition?  Though, in the venality
of this hour, it may be sufficient to throw the whole blame
upon Byng, yet I will venture to say, the other is a question
that, in the judgment of every impartial man, now and
hereafter, will require a better answer, I am afraid, than can
be given.  I believe be was not reckoned backward in point of
personal courage, which makes this affair the more
extraordinary, and induces me to wait for his own account of
it, before I form an opinion of it." Chatham Correspondence,
vol. i. p. 163.-E.

(704) Of Pomfret.



334 Letter 192
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, August 28, 1756.

As you were so kind as to interest yourself about the issue of
my journey, I can tell you that I did get to Strawberry on
Wednesday night, but it was half an hour past ten first-
-besides floods the whole day, I had twenty accidents with my
chaise, and once saw one of the postilions with the wheel upon
his body; he came off with making his nose bleed.  My castle,
like a little ark, is surrounded with many waters, (and
yesterday morning I saw the Blues wade half way up their
horses through Teddington-lane.

There is nothing new but what the pamphlet shops produce;
however it is pleasant to have a new print or ballad every
day--I never had an aversion to living in a Fronde.  The
enclosed cards are the freshest treason; the portraits by
George Townshend are droll--the other is a dull obscure thing
as can be.  The "Worlds" are by Lord Chesterfield on Decorum,
and by a friend of yours and mine, who sent it before he went
to Jersey; but this is a secret: they neglected it till now,
so preferable to hundreds they have published--I suppose Mr.
Moore finds, what every body else has found long, that he is
aground.  I saw Lovel to-day; he is very far advanced and
executes to perfection; you will be quite satisfied; I am not
discontent with my own design, now I see how well it succeeds.
It will certainly be finished by Michaelmas, at which time I
told him he might depend on his money, and he seemed fully
satisfied.  My compliments to your brother, and adieu!



334 Letter 193
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, August 29, 1756.

A journey of amusement into Yorkshire would excuse my not
having writ to you above this month, my dear Sir, but I have a
better reason,--nothing has happened worth telling YOU.  Since
the conquest of Minorca, France seems to have taken the wisest
way for herself, and a sure one too of ruining us, by sitting
still, and yet keeping us upon our guard, at an outrageous
expense.  Gazettes of all countries announce, as you say,
almost a league of Cambray against us; but the best heads
think, that after all Europe has profited of our profusion,
they will have the sense only to look on, while France and we
contend which shall hereafter be the Universal Merchant of
Venal Princes.  If we reckon at all upon the internal
commotions in France, they have still a better prospect from
ours: we ripen to faction fast.  The dearness of corn has even
occasioned insurrections: some of these the Chief Justice
Willcs has quashed stoutly.  The rains have been excessive
just now, and must occasion more inconveniences.  But the
warmth on the loss of Minorca has opened every sluice of
opposition that has been so long dammed up.  Even Jacobitism
perks up those fragments of asses' ears which were not quite
cut to the quick.  The city of London and some counties have
addressed the King and their members on our miscarriages.  Sir
John Barnard, who endeavoured to stem the torrent of the
former, is grown almost as unpopular as Byng.  That poor
simpleton, confined at Greenwich, is ridiculously easy and
secure, and has even summoned on his behalf a Captain Young,
his warmest accuser.  Fowke, who of two contradictory orders
chose to obey the least spirited, is broke.  Pamphlets and
satirical prints teem; the courts are divided; the ministers
quarrel-indeed, if they agreed, one should not have much more
to expect from them! the fair situation!

I do not wonder that you are impertinenced by Richcourt;(705)
there is nothing so catching as the insolence of a great proud
woman(706) by a little upstart minister: the reflection of the
sun from brass makes the latter the more troublesome of the
two.

Your dear brother returns from Bristol this week; as I fear
not much recovered, I shall have good reason to press his
going abroad, though I fear in vain.  I will tell you
faithfully, after I have seen him a few days, what I think of
him.

I never doubt your zeal in executing any commission I give
you.  The bill shall be paid directly; it will encourage me to
employ you; but you are generally so dilatory in that part of
the commission, that I have a thousand times declined asking
your assistance.  Adieu! my dear Sir.

(705) Count Richcourt, a Lorrainer, prime minister at Florence
for the Great Duke.

(706) The Empress Queen, wife of the Great Duke.



335 Letter 194
To Richard Bentley, Esq.
Wentworth Castle, August.

I always dedicate my travels to you.  My present expedition
has been very amusing, sights are thick sown in the counties
of York and Nottingham; the former is more historic, and the
great lords live at a prouder distance: in Nottinghamshire
there is a very heptarchy of little kingdoms elbowing one
another, and the barons of them want nothing but small armies
to make inroads into one another's parks, murder deer, and
massacre park-keepers.  But to come to particulars: the great
road as far as Stamford is superb; in any other country it
would furnish medals, and immortalize any drowsy monarch in
whose reign it was executed.  It is continued much farther,
but is more rumbling. I did not stop at Hatfield(707) and
Burleigh(708) to seek the palaces of my great-uncle-ministers,
having seen them before.

Budgen palace(709) surprises one prettily in a little village;
and the remains of Newark castle, seated pleasantly, began to
open a vein of historic memory.  I had only transient and
distant views of Lord Tyrconnells at Belton, and of Belvoir.
The borders of Huntingdonshire have churches instead of
milestones, but the richness and extent of Yorkshire quite
charmed me.  Oh! what quarries for working in Gothic! This
place is one of the very few that I really like; the
situation, woods, views, and the improvements are perfect in
their kinds; nobody has a truer taste than Lord Strafford.
The house is a pompous front screening an old house; it was
built by the last lord on a design of the Prussian architect
Bott, who is mentioned in the King's M`emoires de Brandenburg,
and is not ugly: the one pair of stairs is entirely engrossed
by a gallery of 180 feet, on the plan of that in the Colonna
palace at Rome: it has nothing but four modern statues and
some bad portraits, but, on my proposal, is going to have
books at each end.  The hall is pretty, but low; the
drawing-room handsome: there wants a good eating-room and
staircase: but I have formed a design for both, and I believe
they will be executed--that my plans should be obeyed when
yours are not!  I shall bring you a groundplot for a Gothic
building, which I have proposed that you should draw for a
little wood, but in the manner of an ancient market-cross.
Without doors all is pleasing: there is a beautiful
(artificial) river, with a fine semicircular wood overlooking
it, and the temple of Tivoli placed happily on a rising
towards the end.  There are obelisks, columns, and other
buildings, and above all, a handsome castle in the true style,
on a rude mountain, with a court -,and towers: in the
castle-yard, a statue of the late lord who built it.  Without
the park is a lake on each side, buried in noble woods.  Now
contrast all this, and you may have some idea of Lord
Rockingham's.  Imagine now a most extensive and most beautiful
modern front erected before the great Lord Strafford's old
house, and this front almost blocked up with hills, and every
thing unfinished around it, nay within it.  The great
apartment, which is magnificent, is untouched -. the
chimney-pieces lie in boxes unopened.  The park is traversed
by a common road between two high hedges--not from necessity.
Oh! no; this lord loves nothing but horses, and the enclosures
for them take place of every thing.  The bowling-green behind
the house contains no less than four obelisks, and looks like
a Brobdignag nine-pin-alley: on a hill near, you would think
you saw the York-buildings water-works invited into the
country.  There are temples in corn-fields; and in the little
wood, a window-frame mounted on a bunch of laurel, and
intended for an hermitage.  In the inhabited part of the
house, the chimney-pieces are like tombs; and on that in the
library is the figure of this lord's grandfather, in a night-
gown of plaster and gold.  Amidst all this litter and bad
taste, I adored the fine Vandvek of Lord Strafford and his
secretary, and could not help reverencing his bed-chamber.
With all his faults and arbitrary behaviour, one must worship
his spirit and eloquence: where one esteems but a single
royalist, one need not fear being too partial.  When I visited
his tomb in the church (which is remarkably neat and pretty,
and enriched with monuments) I was provoked to find a little
mural cabinet, with his figure three feet high kneeling.
Instead of a stern bust (and his head would furnish a nobler
than Bernini's Brutus) one is peevish to see a plaything that
might have been bought at Chenevix's.  There is a tender
inscription to the second Lord Strafford's wife, written by
himself; but his genius was fitter to coo over his wife's
memory than to sacrifice to his father's.

Well! you have had enough of magnificence; you shall repose in
a desert.  Old Wortley Montagu lives on the very spot where
the dragon of Wantley did, only I believe the latter was much
better lodged: you never saw such a wretched hovel; lean,
unpainted, and half its nakedness barely shaded with harateen
stretched till it cracks.  Here the miser hoards health and
money, his only two objects: he has chronicles in behalf of
the air, and battens on tokay, his single indulgence, as he
has heard it is particularly salutary.  But the savageness of
the scene would charm your Alpine taste - it is tumbled with
fragments of mountains, that look ready laid for building the
world.  One scrambles over a huge terrace, on which mountain
ashes and various trees spring out of the very rocks; and at
the brow is the don, but not spacious enough for such an
inmate.  However, I am persuaded it furnished Pope with this
line, so exactly it answers to the picture:

"On rifted rocks, the dragon's late abodes."

I wanted to ask Pope if he had not visited Lady Mary Wortley
here during their intimacy, but could one put that question to
Avidien himself?  There remains an ancient odd inscription
here, which has such a whimsical mixture of devotion and
romanticness that I must transcribe it:-

"Preye for the soul of Sir Thomas Wortley. Knight of the body
to the kings Edward IV., Richard III., Henry VII., Henry
VIII., whose faults God pardon.  He caused a lodge to be built
on this crag in the midst of Wharncliff (the old orthography)
to hear the harts bell, in the year of our Lord 1510."  It was
a chase, and what he meant to hear was the noise of the stags.

During my residence here I have made two little excursions and
I assure you it requires resolution . the roads are
insufferable: they mend them--I should call it spoil them--
-with large pieces of stone.  At Pomfret I saw the remains of
that memorable castle "where Rivers, Vaughan, and Gray lay
shorter by the head;" and on which Gray says,

"And thou, proud boy, from Pomfret's walls shalt send
A groan, and envy oft thy happy grandsire's end!"(710)

The ruins are vanishing, but well situated; there is a large
demolished church and a pretty market-house.  We crossed a
Gothic bridge of eight arches at Ferrybridge, where there is a
pretty view, and went to a large old house of Lord
Huntingdon's at Ledstone, which has nothing remarkable but a
lofty terrace, a whole-length portrait of his Grandfather in
tapestry, and the having belonged to the great Lord Strafford.
We saw that monument of part of poor Sir John Bland's
extravagance,(711) his house and garden, which he left orders
to make without once looking at either plan.  The house is a
bastard- Gothic, but Of not near the extent I had heard.  We
lay at Leeds, a dingy large town; and through very bad black
roads, (for the whole country is a colliery, or a quarry,) we
went to Kirkstall Abbey, where are vast Saxon ruins, in a most
picturesque situation, on the banks of a river that falls into
a cascade among rich meadows, hills, and woods: it belongs to
Lord Cardigan: his father pulled down a large house here '.
lest it should interfere with the family seat, Deane.  We
returned through Wakefield, where is a pretty Gothic chapel on
a bridge,(712) erected by Edward IV., in memory of his father,
who lived at Sandal castle just by, and perished in the battle
here, There is scarce any thing of the castle extant, but it
commanded a rich prospect.

By permission from their graces of Norfolk, who are at
Tunbridge, Lord Strafford carried us to WorkSop,(713) where we
passed two days.  The house is huge, and one of the
magnificent works of old Bess of Hardwicke, who guarded the
Queen of Scots here for some time in a wretched little
bedchamber within her own lofty one: there is a tolerable
little picture of Mary's needlework.  The great apartment is
vast and triste, the whole leanly furnished: the great
gallery, of above two hundred feet, at the top of the house,
is divided into a library, and into nothing.  The chapel is
decent.  There is no prospect, and the barren face of the
country is richly furred with evergreen plantations, under the
direction of the late Lord Petre.

On our way we saw Kiveton, an ugly neglected seat of the Duke
of Leeds, with noble apartments and several good portraits!  I
went to Welbeck.  It is impossible to describe the bales of
Cavendishes, harleys, Holleses, Veres, and Ogles: every
chamber is tapestried with them; nay, and with ten thousand
other fat morsels; all their histories inscribed; all their
arms, crests, devices, sculptured on chimneys of various
English marbles in ancient forms (and, to say truth, most of
them ugly).  Then such a Gothic hall, with pendent fretwork in
imitation of the old, and with a chimney-piece extremely like
mine in the library.  Such water-colour pictures! such
historic fragments!  In short, such and so much of every thing
I like, that my party thought they should never get me away
again.  There is Prior's portrait, and the column and
Varelst's flower on which he wrote; and the authoress Duchess
of Newcastle in a theatric habit, which she generally wore,
and, consequently,, looking as mad as the present Duchess; and
dukes of the same name, looking as foolish as the present
Duke; and Lady Mary Wortley, drawn as an authoress, with
rather better pretensions; and cabinets and glasses wainscoted
with the Greendale oak, which was so large that an old steward
wisely cut a way through it to make a triumphal passage for
his lord and lady on their wedding, and only killed it! But it
is impossible to tell you@ half what there is.  The poor woman
who is just dead passed her whole widowhood, except in doing
ten thousand right and just things, in collecting and
monumenting the portraits and relics of all the great families
from which she descended, and which centred in her.  The Duke
and Duchess of Portland are expected there to-morrow, and we
saw dozens of cabinets and coffers with the seals not yet
taken off What treasures to revel over!  The horseman Duke's
man`ege is converted into a lofty stable,. and there is still
a grove or two of magnificent oaks that have escaped all these
great families, though the last Lord Oxford cut down above an
hundred thousand pounds' worth.  The place has little pretty,
distinct from all these reverend circumstances.

(707) Hatfield, the seat of the Earl of Salisbury, was
exchanged by King James I. with Robert Cecil, first Earl of
Salisbury, for Theobald's, in the same county.  Evelyn visited
Hatfield in March 1643: "I went," he says, "to see my Lord
Salisbury's palace at Hatfield, where the most considerable
rarity, besides the house," (inferior to few then in England
for its architecture,) " was the garden and vineyard, rarely
well-watered and planted.  They also showed us the picture of
Secretary Cecil in mosaic work, very well done by some Italian
hand."-E.

339 Letter 195
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 19, 1756.

I promised you an account of your brother as soon as he should
return from Bristol, but I deferred it for a week, till I
could see him reposed and refreshed, and could judge more
fairly.  I do think him much mended; I do not say recovered.
H e looks with colour again, and has (got a little flesh, and
is able to do much more than before he went.  My Lord Radnor
thinks he has a great appetite; I did not perceive it when he
dined with me.  His breath is better, though sometimes
troublesome, and he brought back a great cough, which,
however, is much abated.  I think him so much better, that I
ventured to talk very freely to him upon his own state; and
though I allowed him mended, I told him plainly that I was
convinced his case would be irrecoverable, if he did not go
abroad.  At times he swears he will, if he falls back at all;
at others he will not listen to it, but pleads the confusion
of his affairs.  I wish there is not another more
insurmountable cause, the fury, who not only torments him in
this world, but is hurrying him into the next.  I have not
been able to prevail with him to pass one day or two here with
me in tranquility.  I see his life at stake, I feel for him,
for you, for myself'; I am desperate about it, and yet know no
remedy!  I can only assure you that I will not see it quietly;
nor would any thing check me from going the greatest lengths
with your sister, whom I think effectually, though perhaps not
maliciously, a most wicked being, but that I always find it
recoils upon your brother.  Alas! what signifies whether she
murders him from a bad heart or a bad temper?

Poor Mr. Chute, too, has been grievously ill with the gout- he
is laid up at his own house, whither I am going to see him.

I feel a little satisfaction that you have an opportunity of
Richcourt's insults: who thought that the King of Prussia
would ever be a rod in our hands? For my part, I feel quite
pleasant, for whether he demolishes the Queen, or the Queen
him, can one but find a loophole to let out joy?  Lord
Stormont's(714) valet de chambre arrived three days ago with
an account of his being within four leagues of Dresden.(715)
He laughs at the King o abuses Count Bruhl(716) with so much
contempt, that one reconciles to him very fast: however, I
don't know what to think of his stopping in Saxony.  He
assures us, that the Queen has not 55,000 men, nor magazines,
nor money; but why give her time to get away? As the chance
upon the long run must be so much against him, and as he has
three times repeated his offers of desisting if the
Empress-Queen will pawn her honour (counters to which I wonder
he of all Kings would trust) that she will not attack him, one
must believe that he thinks himself reduced to this step; but
I don@t see how he is reduced to involve the Russian Empress
in the quarrel too.  He affirms that both intended to demolish
him--but I think I would not accuse both till at least I had
humbled one.  We are much pleased with this expedition, but at
best it ensures the duration of the war--and I wish we don't
attend more to that on the Continent than to that on our
element, especially as we are discouraged a little on the
latter.  You reproach me for not telling you more of Byng-
-what can I tell you, my dear child, of a poor simpleton who
behaves arrogantly and ridiculously in the most calamitous of
all situations?  he quarrels with the admiralty and ministry
every day, though he is doing all he can to defer his trial.
After he had asked for and had had granted a great number of
witnesses, he demanded another large set: this has been
refused him: he is under close confinement, but it will be
scarce possible to try him before the Parliament meets.

The rage of addresses did not go far: at present every thing
is quiet.  Whatever ministerial politics there are, are in
suspense.  The rains are begun, and I suppose will soon
disperse our camps.  The Parliament does not meet till the
middle of November.  Admiral Martin, whom I think you knew in
Italy, died here yesterday, unemployed.  This is a complete
abridgement of all I know, except that, since Colonel
Jefferies arrived, we think still worse of the land-officers
on board the fleet, as Boyd passed from St. Philip's to the
fleet easily and back again.  Jefferies (strange that Lord
Tyrawley should not tell him) did not know till he landed
here,,what succour had been intended--he could not refrain
from tears.  Byng's brother did die immediately on his
arrival.(717)  I shall like to send you Prussian journals, but
am much more intent on what relates to your brother.  Adieu!

made great expedition, he was on the next morning seized with
convulsions, and died.-E.



341 Letter 196
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 14, 1756.

I shall certainly not bid for the chariot for you; do you
estimate an old dowager's new machine but at ten pounds? You
could scarce have valued herself at less! it is appraised here
at fifty.  There are no family pictures but such as you might
buy at any sale, that is, there are three portraits without
names.  If you had offered ten pounds for a set of Pelhams,
perhaps I should not have thought you had underpriced them.

You bid me give you some account of myself; I can in a very
few words: I am quite alone; in the morning I view a new pond
I am making for gold fish, and stick in a few shrubs or trees,
wherever I can find a space, which is very rare: in the
evening I scribble a little; all this is mixed with reading;
that is, I can't say I read much, but I pick up a good deal of
reading.  The only thing I have done that can compose a
paragraph, and which I think you are Whig enough to forgive
me, is, that on each side of my bed I have hung MAGNA CHARTA,
and the warrant for King Charles's execution, on which I have
written Major Charta; and I believe, without the latter, the
former by this time would be of very little importance.  You
will ask where Mr. Bentley is; confined with five sick
infants, who
live in spite of the epidemic distemper, as if they were
infantas, and in bed himself with a fever and the same sore
throat, though he sends me word he mends.

The King of Prussia has sent us over a victory, which is very
kind, as we are not likely to get any of our own-not even by
the secret Expedition, which you apprehend, and which I
believe still less than I did the invasion-perhaps indeed
there may be another port on the coast of France which we hope
to discover, as we did one in the last war.  By degrees, and
somehow or other, I believe, we shall be fully acquainted with
France.  I saw the German letter you mention, think it very
mischievous, and very well written for the purpose.

You talk of being better than you have been for many months;
pray, which months were they, and what was the matter with
you?  Don't send me your fancies; I shall neither pity nor
comfort you.  You are perfectly well, and always were ever
since I knew you, which is now--I won't say how long, but
within this century.  Thank God you have good health, and
don't call it names.

John and I are just going to Garrick's with a grove of
cypresses in our hands, like the Kentish men at the Conquest.
He has built a temple to his master Shakspeare, and I am going
to adorn the outside, since his modesty would not let me
decorate it within, as I proposed, with these mottoes:

"Quod spiro et placeo, si placeo, tuum est.
That I spirit have and nature,
That sense breathes in ev'ry feature,
That I please, if please I do,
Shakspeare, all I owe to you."



342 Letter 197
To George Montagu, Esq.
Twickenham, Monday.

You are desired to have business to hinder you from going to
Northampton, and you are desired to have none to hinder you
from coming to Twickenham.  The autumn is in great beauty; my
Lord Radnor's baby-houses lay eggs every day, and promise new
swarms; Mrs. Chandler treads, but don't lay; and the
neighbouring dowagers order their visiting coaches before
sunset-can you resist such a landscape? only send me a line
that I may be sure to be ready for you, for I go to London now
and then to buy coals.

I believe there cannot be a word of truth in Lord Granville's
going to Berlin; by the clumsiness of the thought, I should
take it for ministerial wit--and so, and so.

The Twickenham Alabouches say that Legge is to marry the
eldest Pelhamine infanta; he loves a minister's daughter--I
shall not wonder if he intends it, but can the parents! Mr.
Conway mentioned nothing to me but of the prisoners of the
last battle. and I hope it extends no farther, but I vow I
don't see why it should not.  Adieu!



342 Letter 198
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 17, 1756.

Lentulus (I am going to tell you no old Roman tale; he is the
King of Prussia's aide-de-camp) arrived yesterday, with ample
Confirmation of the victory in Bohemia.(718)  Are not you glad
that we have got a victory that we can at least call Cousin?
Between six and seven thousand Austrians were killed: eight
Prussian squadrons sustained the acharnement, which is said to
have been extreme, of thirty-two squadrons of Austrians: the
pursuit lasted from Friday noon till Monday morning; both our
countrymen Brown and Keith(719) performed wonders--we seem to
flourish much when transplanted to Germany--but Germany don't
make good manure here!  The Prussian King writes that both
Brown and Piccolomini are too strongly entrenched to be
attacked.  His Majesty ran to this victory; not `a la
Mulwitz.(720)  He affirms having found In the King of Poland's
cabinet ample justification of his treatment of Saxony--should
not one query whether he had not those proofs(721) in his
hands antecedent to the cabinet?  The Dauphiness(722) is said
to have flung herself at the King of France's feet and begged
his protection for her father; that he promised "qu'il le
rendroit au centuple au Roi de Prusse."

Peace is made between the courts of Kensington and Kew; Lord
Bute(723) who had no visible employment at the latter, and yet
whose office was certainly no sinecure, is to be groom of the
stole(724) to the Prince of Wales; which satisfies.  The rest
of the family will be named before the birthday--but I don't
know how, as soon as one wound is closed, another breaks out!
Mr. Fox, extremely discontent at having no power, no
confidence, no favour, (all entirely engrossed by the old
monopolist(725) has asked leave to resign.  It is not yet
granted.  If Mr. Pitt will--or can, accept the seals, probably
Mr. Fox will be indulged,--if Mr. Pitt will not, why then, it
is impossible to tell you what will happen.(726)  Whatever
happens on such an emergency, with the Parliament SO near,
with no time for considering measures, with so bad a past, and
so much worse a future, there certainly is no duration or good
in prospect.  Unless the King of Prussia will take our affairs
at home as well as abroad to nurse, I see no possible recovery
for us-and you may believe, when a doctor like him is
necessary, I should be full as willing to die of the
distemper.

Well! and so you think we are undone!--not at all; if folly
and extravagance are symptoms of nation's being at the height
of their glory, as after-observers pretend that they are
forerunners Of its ruin, we never were in a more flourishing
situation.  My Lord Rockingham and my nephew Lord Orford have
made a match of five hundred pounds, between five turkeys and
five geese, to run from Norwich to London.  Don't you believe
in the transmigration of souls?  And are not you convinced
that this race is between Marquis Sardanapalus and Earl
Heliogabalus?  And don't you pity the poor Asiatics and
Italians who comforted themselves on their resurrection with
being geese and turkeys?

Here's another symptom of our glory! The Irish Speaker, Mr.
Ponsonby,(727) has been reposing himself at Newmarket.  George
Selwyn, seeing him toss about bank-bills at the hazard-table,
said, "How easily the Speaker passes the money-bills!"

You, who live at Florence among vulgar vices and tame slavery,
will stare at these accounts.  Pray be acquainted with your
own country, while it is in its lustre.  In a regular monarchy
the folly of the Prince gives the tone; in a downright
tyranny, folly dares give itself no airs; it is in a wanton
overgrown commonwealth that whim and debauchery ]Intrigue best
together.  Ask me which of these governments I prefer--oh! the
last--only I fear it is the least durable.

I have not yet thanked you for your letter of September 18th,
with the accounts of the Genoese treaty and of the Pretender's
quarrel with the Pope--it is a squabble worthy a Stuart.  Were
he here, as absolute as any Stuart ever wished to be, who
knows with all his bigotry but he might favour us with a
reformation and the downfall of the mass? The ambition of
making a Duke of York vice-chancellor of holy church would be
as good a reason for breaking with holy church, as Harry the
Eighth's was for quarrelling with it, because it would not
excuse him from going to bed to his sister, after it had given
him leave.

I wish I could tell you that your brother mends! indeed I
don't think he does; nor do I know what to say to him; I have
exhausted both arguments and entreaties, and yet if I thought
either would avail, would gladly recommence them.  Adieu!

Leicester-house, where this young Prince has resided, and
since his father's death has continued without intermission,
till new officers were to be placed under him.  It is said
that another person was to be groom of the stole, but that the
Prince's earnest request was complied with in my lord's
favour.  It is supposed that the governors, preceptors, etc.
who were about him before will be now set aside, and that my

344 Letter 199
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Oct. 28, 1756.

Can you recommend one a first minister? We want one so much,
that we do not insist upon his having a character from his
last place: there will be good vails.--But I forget; one ought
to condole with you: the Duke of Newcastle is your cousin, and
as I know by experience how much one loves one's relations, I
sympathize with you!  But, alas! all first ministers are
mortal; and, as Sir Jonathan Swift said, crowned heads and
cane heads, good heads and no heads at all, may all come to
disgrace.  My father, who had no capacity, and the Duke of
Newcastle, who has so much, have equally experienced the
mutability of this world.  Well-a-day, well-a-day! his grace
is gone!  He has bid adieu to courts, retires to a hermitage,
and Will let his beard grow as long as his Duchess's.

so you are surprised! and the next question you will ask will
be, who succeeds?  Truly that used to be a question the
easiest in the world to be resolved upon change of ministers.
It is now the most unanswerable.  I can only tell you that all
the atoms are dancing, and as atoms always do, I suppose. will
range themselves into the most durable system imaginable.
Beyond the past hour I know not a syllable; a good deal of'
the preceding hours--a volume would not contain it.  There is
some notion that the Duke of Bedford and your cousin Halifax
are to be the secretaries of state--as Witwould says, they
will sputter at one another like roasted apples.

The Duchess of Hamilton has brought her beauty to London at
the only instant when it would not make a crowd.  I believe we
should scarce stare at the King of Prussia, so much are we
engrossed by this ministerial ferment.

I have been this morning to see your monument;(728) it IS not
Put together, but the parts are admirably executed; there is a
helmet that would tempt one to enlist.  The inscription suits
wonderfully, but I have overruled the golden letters, which
not Only are not lasting, but would not do at all, as they are
to be cut in statuary marble.  I have given him the arms,
which certainly should be in colours: but a shield for your
sister's would be barbarous tautology.  You see how arbitrary
I am, as you gave me leave to be.  Adieu!

(728) To the memory of his sister, Miss Harriet Montagu.-E.



345 Letter 200
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 4, 1756.

I desired your brother last week to tell you that it was in
vain for me to write while every thing was in such confusion.
The chaos is just as far from being dispersed now; I only
write to tell you what has been its motions.  One of the
Popes, I think, said soon after his accession, he did not
think it had been so easy to govern.  What would he have
thought of such a nation as this, engaged in a formidable war,
without any government at all, literally, for above a
fortnight! The foreign ministers have not attempted to
transact any business since yesterday fortnight.  For God's
sake, what do other countries say of us?--but hear the
progress of our inter-ministerium.

When Mr. Fox had declared his determination of resigning great
offers were sent to Mr. Pitt; his demands were much greater,
accompanied with a total exclusion of the Duke of Newcastle.
Some of the latter's friends would have persuaded him, as the
House of Commons is at his devotion, to have undertaken the
government against both Pitt and Fox; but fears preponderated.
Yesterday his grace declared his resolution of retiring with
all that satisfaction of mind which must attend a man whom not
one man of sense, will trust any longer.  The King sent for
Mr. Fox, and bid him try if Mr. Pitt would join him.  The
latter, without any hesitation, refused.  In this perplexity
the King ordered the Duke of Devonshire to try to compose some
ministry for him, and sent him to Pitt, to try to accommodate
with Fox.(729)  Pitt, with a list of terms a little modified,
was ready to engage, but on condition that Fox should have no
employment in the cabinet.  Upon this plan negotiations have
been carrying on for this week.  Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge, whose
whole party consists of from twelve to sixteen persons,
exclusive of Leicester-house, (of that presently,) concluded
they were entering on the government as secretary of state and
chancellor of the exchequer;@ but there is so great
unwillingness to give it up totally into their hands, that all
manner of expedients have been projected to get rid of their
proposals, or to limit their power.  Thus the case stands at
this instant: the Parliament has been put off for a fortnight,
to gain time; the Lord knows whether that will suffice to
bring on any sort of temper!  In the mean time the government
stands still; pray Heaven the war may too! You will wonder how
fifteen or sixteen persons can be of such importance.  In the
first place, their importance has been conferred on them, and
has been notified to the nation by these concessions and
messages; next, Minorca is gone; Oswego gone; the nation is in
a ferment; some very great indiscretions in delivering a
Hanoverian soldier from prison by a warrant from the secretary
of state have raised great difficulties; instructions from
counties, boroughs, especially from the city of London, in the
style of 1641, and really in the spirit of 1715(730) and 1745,
have raised a great flame; and lastly, the countenance of
Leicester-house, which Mr. Pitt is supposed to have,(731) and
which Mr. Legge thinks he has, all these tell Pitt that he may
command such numbers without doors as may make the majorities
within the House tremble.

Leicester-house is by some thought inclined to more pacific
measures.  Lord Bute's being established groom of the stole
has satisfied.  They seem more Occupied in disobliging all
their new court than in disturbing the King's.  Lord
Huntingdon, the new master of the horse to the Prince, and
Lord Pembroke, one of his lords, have not been spoken to.
Alas! if the present storms should blow over, what seeds for
new!  You must guess at the sense of this paragraph, which it
is difficult, at least improper to explain to you; though you
could not go into a coffee-house here where it would not be
interpreted to you.  One would think all those little
politicians had been reading the Memoirs of the minority of
Louis XIV.

There has been another great difficulty: the season obliging
all camps to break up, the poor Hanoverians' have been forced
to continue soaking in theirs.  The country magistrates have
been advised that they arc not obliged by law to billet
foreigners on public-houses, and have refused.  Transports
were yesterday ordered to carry away the Hanoverians! There
are eight thousand men taken from America; for I am sure we
can spare none from hence.  The negligence and dilatoriness of
the ministers at home, the wickedness of our West Indian
governors, and the little-minded quarrels of the regulars and
irregular forces, have reduced our affairs in that part of the
world to a most deplorable state.  Oswego, of ten times more
importance even than Minorca, is so annihilated that we cannot
learn the particulars.

My dear Sir, what a present and future picture have I given
you!  The details are infinite, and what I have neither time,
nor, for many reasons, the imprudence to send by the post:
your good sense will but too well lead you to develop them.
The crisis is most melancholy and alarming.  I remember two or
three years ago I wished for more active times, and for events
to furnish our correspondence.  I think I could write you a
letter almost as big as my Lord Clarendon's History.  What a
bold man is he who shall undertake the administration! How
much shall we be obliged to him! How mad is he, whoever is
ambitious of it! Adieu!

(729) "The Duke of Devonshire advised his Majesty to comply
with Pitt's demands, whereupon the administration was formed;
on which account the Duke was unjustly censured by some
unreasonable friends; for he joined Pitt rather than Fox, not
from any change of friendship, or any partiality in Pitt's
favour, but because it was more safe to be united with him who
had the nation of his side, than with the man who was the most
unpopular; a reason which will have its proper weight with
most ministers." Waldegrave's Memoirs, p. 87.-E.

(730) Meaning that the Jacobites excited the clamour.

(731) Lord Temple, in a letter to Mr. Pitt of the 11th, says,
"Lord Bute used expressions so transcendently obliging to me,
and so decisive of the determined purpose of Leicester-house
towards us, in the present or any future day, that your own
lively imagination cannot suggest to you a wish beyond them."
Chatham correspondence, vol. i. p. 191.-E.



347 Letter 201
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, November 6, 1756.

After an inter-MinisteriUm of seventeen days, Mr. Pitt has
this morning, accepted the government as secretary of state;
the Duke of Newcastle and Mr. Fox being both excluded.  The
Duke of Devonshire is to be at the head of the treasury. the
Chancellor(732) retires; the seals to be in commission.
Remnants of both administrations must be preserved, as Mr.
Pitt has not wherewithal to fill a quarter of their
employments.  Did you ever expect to see a time when he would
not have cousins enough? It will take some days to adjust all
that is to follow.  You see that, unless Mr. Pitt joins with
either Fox or Newcastle, his ministry cannot last six months;
I would bet that the lightness of the latter emerged first.
George Selwyn, hearing some people at Arthur's t'other night
lamenting the distracted state of the country, joined in the
discourse, with the whites of his eyes and his prim mouth, and
fetching a deep sigh, said, "Yes, to be sure it is terrible!
There is the Duke of Newcastle's faction, and there is Fox's
faction, and there is Leicester-house! between two factions
and one faction we are torn to pieces!"

Thank you for your exchequer-ward wishes for me, but I am apt
to think that I have enough from there already: don't think my
horns and hoofs are growing, when I profess indifference to my
interest.  Disinterestedness is no merit in me, 'It happens to
be my passion.  It certainly is not impossible that your two
young lords may appear in the new system.  Mr. Williams is
just come from his niece, Lady North's, and commends her
husband exceedingly.  He tells me that the plump Countess is
in terrors lest Lord Coventry should get a divorce from his
wife and Lord Bolingbroke should marry her.  'Tis a
well-imagined panic!

Mr. Mann, I trust, does not grow worse; I wish I could think
he mended.  Mr. B. is sitting in his chimney-corner literally
with five girls; I expect him to meet me to-morrow at
Strawberry.  As no provision is made for the great C`u in the
new arrangement, it is impossible but he may pout a little.
My best compliments to your brothers and sisters. Adieu! Will
this find you at Greatworth!

(732) Lord Hardwicke.



348 Letter 202
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 13, 1756.

Your brother has told me that Mr. Pitt accepts your southern
province, yielding to leave Lord Holderness in the northern.
I don't know what calm you at this distance may suppose this
will produce; I should think little; for though the Duke of
Newcastle resigned on Thursday, and Mr. Fox resigns to-day,
the chief friends of each remain in place -, and Mr. Pitt
accedes with so little strength that his success seems very
precarious.  If he Hanoverizes, or checks any inquiries, he
loses his popularity, and falls that way; if he burnouts the
present rage of the people, he provokes two powerful factions.
His only chance seems to depend on joining with the Duke of
Newcastle, who is most offended with Fox: but after Pitt's
personal exclusion of his grace, and considering Pitt's small
force, it may not be easy for him to be accepted there.  I
foresee nothing but confusion: the new system is composed of
such discordant parts that it can produce no harmony.  Though
the Duke of Newcastle, the Chancellor, Lord Anson, and Fox
quit, yet scarce one of their friends is discarded.  The very
cement seems disjunctive; I mean the Duke of Devonshire, who
takes the treasury.  If he acts cordially, he disobliges his
intimate friend Mr. Fox; if he does not, he offends Pitt.
These little reasonings will give you light, though very
insufficient for giving you a clear idea of the most perplexed
and complicate situation that ever was.  Mr. Legge returns to
be chancellor of the exchequer, and Sir George Lyttelton is
indemnified with a peerage.  The Duke of Newcastle has got his
dukedom entailed on Lord Lincoln.  The seals are to be in
commission, if not given to a lord keeper.  Your friend Mr.
Doddington(733) is out again for about the hundred and
fiftieth time.  The rest of the list is pretty near settled;
you shall have it as soon as it takes place.  I should tell
you that Lord Temple is first lord of the admiralty.

Being much too busy to attend to such trifles as a war and
America, we know mighty little of either.  The massacre at
Oswego happily proves a romance: part of the two regiments
that were made prisoners there are actually arrived at
Plymouth, the provisions at Quebec being too scanty to admit
additional numbers.  The King of Prussia is gone into winter
quarters, but disposed in immediate readiness. One hears that
he has assured us, that if we will keep our fleet in good
order, he will find employment for the rest of our enemies.
Two days ago, in the midst of all the ferment at court,
Coloredo, the Austrian minister, abruptly demanded an
audience, in which he demanded our quotas: I suppose the King
told him that whenever he should have a ministry again he
would consult them.  I will tell you my comment on this: the
Empress-Queen, who is scrupulous on the ceremonial of
mischief, though she so easily passes over the reality and
ingratitude, proposes, I imagine, on a refusal which she
deserves and has drawn upon her, to think herself justified in
assisting France in some attempts on us from the coast of
Flanders.  I have received yours of October 23d, and am glad
the English showed a proper disregard of Richcourt.  Thank you
a thousand times for your goodness to Mr. and Mrs. Dick: it
obliges me exceedingly, and I am sure will be most grateful to
Lady Henry Beauclerc.

I don't know what to answer to that part about your brother:
you think and argue exactly as I have done; would I had not
found it in vain! but, my dear child, you and I have never
been married, and are sad judges!  As to your elder brother's
interposition, I wish he had tenderness enough to make him
arbitrary.  I beg your pardon, but he is fitter to marry your
sister than to govern her.  Your brother Gal. certainly looks
better; yet I think of him just as you do, and by no means
trust to so fallacious a distemper.  Indeed I tease him to
death to take a resolution, but to no purpose.  In short, my
dear Sir, they are melancholy words, but I can neither flatter
you publicly nor privately; England is undone, and your
brother is not to be persuaded; Yet i hope the former will not
be quite given up, and I shall certainly neglect nothing
possible with regard to the latter.  Adieu!
'

(733) Doddington, in his Diary of the 15th, says, "The Duke of
Devonshire told me that he was forced by the King to take the
employment he held; that his grace was ordered to go to Mr.
Pitt, and know upon what conditions he would serve; that, in
the arrangement Pitt and his friends made, my office was
demanded--he was sorry for it--he was not concerned in it--and
he behaved very civilly," etc.-E.



350 Letter 203
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Nov. 25, 1756.

You must tell me what or whose the verses are that you demand;
I know of none.  I could send you reams of tests, contests,
and such stupid papers, and bushels of more stupid cards.  I
know of nothing good; nor of any news, but that the committee
of creations is not closed yet.  Mr. Obrien was yesterday
created Irish Earl of Thomond.  Mr. Pitt is to be wrapped up
in flannel, and brought to town to-morrow to see King George
the Second; and I believe, to dissolve the new ministry,
rather than to cement it.  Mr. Fox has commenced hostilities,
and has the borough of Stockbridge from under Dr. Hay, one of
the new admiralty; this enrages extremely the new ministers,
who, having neither members nor boroughs enough , will
probably recur to their only resource, popularity.

I am exceedingly obliged to the Colonel, but is that new? to
whom am I so much obliged?  I will not trouble him with any
commissions: the little money I have I am learning to save:
the times give one a hint that one may have occasion for it.

I beg my best compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Wetenhall, and Mr.
John Montagu.  Don't you wish me joy of my Lord Hertford's

To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, November 29,

No material event has yet happened under the new
administration; indeed it has scarce happened itself: your new
master, Mr. Pitt, has been confined in the country with the
gout, and came to town but within these two days.  The world,
who love to descry policy in every thing, and who have always
loved to find it in Mr. Pitt's illnesses, were persuaded that
his success was not perfect enough, and that he even hesitated
whether he should consummate.  He is still so lame that he
cannot go to court--to be sure the King must go to him He
takes the seals on Saturday; the Parliament meets on Thursday,
but will adjourn for about ten days for the re-elections.  The
new ministers are So little provided with interest in
boroughs, that it is almost an administration out of
Parliament.  Mr. Fox has already attacked their seats, and has
undermined Dr. Hay, one of the new admiralty, in Stockbridge:
this angers extremely.  The Duke of Newcastle is already
hanging out a white flag to Pitt; but there is so little
disposition in that quarter to treat, that they have employed
one Evans-, a lawyer, to draw up articles of impeachment
against Lord Anson.  On the other hand they show great
tenderness to Byng, who has certainly been most inhumanly and
spitefully treated by Anson.  Byng's trial is not yet
appointed.  Lord Effingham, Cornwallis, and Stuart are
arrived, and are to have their conduct examined this day
se'nnight by three general officers.  In the mean time the
King, of his own motion, has given a red riband and an Irish
barony to old Blakeney, who has been at court in a
hackney-coach, with a foot soldier behind it.  As he has not
only lost his government, but as he was bedrid while it was
losing, these honours are a little ridiculed: we have too many
governors that will expect titles, if losses are pretensions!
Mr. Obrien is made Earl of Thomond:(734) my Lady Townshend
rejoices; she says he has family enough to re-establish the
dignity of the Irish peerage, to which of late nothing but
brewers and poulterers have been raised; that she expected
every day to receive a bill from her fishmonger, signed Lord
Mountshrimp!

I promised you a list of the changes when they should be
complete.  They are very conveniently ready to fill the rest
of my letter.

Transcriber's note: In the print copy the following
information is given in three columns: the new office-holder
on the left, the office in the middle, and the previous
office-holder on the right.

Duke of Devonshire, in the room of the duke of Newcastle

(P) Mr. Legge, Chancellor of exchequer, in the room of (N) Sir
G. Lyttelton a peer.

 (N) Mr. Nugent, Lord Duncannon, (P) Mr. J. Grenville, of the
Old Treasury; in the room of Mr. Furnese, dead; (N) mr.
Obrien, Irish Earl.

Mr. w. Pitt, Secretary of State, in the room of mr. Fox.

Lord Buckingham, Lord of bedchamber, in the room of Lord
Fitzwilliam, dead.

(F) Mr. Edgcumbe, Comptroller of Household, in the room of
Lord Buckingham.

(F) Lord Berkeley of Stratton, Captain of pensioners, in the
room of the late Lord Buckingham.

(F) Lord Bateman, Treasurer of Household, in the room of Lord
berkeley.

(P) Mr. G. Grenville, Treasurer of the Navy, in the room of
(F) mr. dodinglton.

(P) Mr. Potter, Joint paymaster, in the room of (N) Lord
Darlington

(P) mr. martin, Secretary of Treasury, in the room of (N) Mr.
West.

(P) Sir r. Lyttelton, Master of jewel Office, in the room of
(N) Lord Breadalbane.

(N) Lord Breadalbane, Justice in Eyre, in the room of (N) Lord

(N) Lord Sandys, Speaker of House of Lords, in the room of (N)
Lord Chancellor.

Lord chief Justice Willes, (P) Justice Wilmot, and baron

the room of (N) Lord Anson, Admiral (N) rowley, Lord
Duncannon, (F) Lord Bateman, Lord Hyde, and (F) mr. Edgcumbe.
But John Pitt is to resign again, and be made Paymaster of the
Marines, to make room for Admiral Forbes.

Charles Townshend, Treasurer of the Chambers, in the room of
Lord Hilsborough, English baron.

This last is not done; as Mr. Townshend cannot be rechosen at
Yarmouth, he only consents to accept, provided another borough
can be found for him' this does not appear very easy.

The Duke of Newcastle has advertised in all the newspapers,
that he retires without place or pension: here is a list of
his disinterestedness.  The reversion of his dukedom for Lord
Lincoln: this is the only duchy bestowed by the present King:
on my father's resignation, the new ministers did prevail to
have dukedoms offered to Lord Northampton and Lord Ailesbury;
but both declined, having no sons.  Mr. Shelley, the Duke's
nephew, has the reversion of Arundel's place: Mr. West has a
great reversion for himself and his son: your little waxen
friend, Tommy Pelham, has another reversion in the Customs.
Jones, the Duke's favourite secretary, and nephew of the late
chancellor, has another.  Not to mention the English barony
for Sir George Lyttelton, and the Irish earldom for Mr.
Obrien.  The Garters are given to the Duke of' Devonshire, to
Lord Carlisle, Lord Northumberland, and (to my great
satisfaction) to Lord Hertford.

Oh! I should explain the marks: the (N) signifies of the
Newcastle and Hardwick faction; the (P) of Pitt's; the (F) of
Fox's.  You will be able by these to judge a little of how
strange a medley the new government is composed! consequently,
how durable!

I was with your brother this morning at Richmond; he thinks
himself better; I do not think him worse; but judge by your
own feelings if that is enough to content me.  Pray that your
brother and your country may mend a little faster! I dread the
winter for him, and the summer for England! Adieu!

P. S. Since I have finished this, I received yours of November
13th, with the account of Richcourt's illness.  What! you are
forced to have recourse to apoplexies and deaths for
revolutions! We make nothing of changing our ministers at
every fall of the leaf.  My Lord Huntingdon (who, by the way,
loves you, and does you justice,) has told me one or two very
good bon-mots of the Pope:(735) I have always had a great
partiality for the good old man: I desire you will tell me any
anecdotes or stories of him that you know-.  I remember some
of his sayings with great humour and wit.  You can never
oblige me more than by anecdotes of particular people--but you
are indeed always good in that and every other way.

(734) Percy Windham Obrien, second son of Sir William Windham,
by a daughter of Charles Duke of Somerset.  The Earl of
Thomond, who had married another daughter, left his estate to
this Mr. Windham, his wife's nephew, on condition of his
taking the name of Obrien.

352 Letter 205
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Dec. 8, 1756.

 Your poor brother desires me to write to you to-day, as he is
in bed (and not able.  He went to town last week, caught cold,
and returned with a fever.  He has been drinking tar-water
since the middle of November, at the persuasion of your older
brother and his Richmond friends.  Indeed he had gone through
the whole course of drugs to no purpose.  There is a great
eruption to-day in most parts of his body, which they think
will be of great service to him.  In my own opinion, he is so
weak, that I am in great apprehensions for him.  He is very
low-spirited, and yet thinks himself much better to-day.  Your
brother Ned was surprised at my being so alarmed, as they had
considered this as a most fortunate crisis-but I have much
difficulty in persuading myself to be so sanguine.  As we have
a recess for a few days, I shall stay here till Saturday, and
see your brother again, and will tell you my opinion again.
You see I don't deceive you: if that is any satisfaction, be
assured that nobody else would give you so bad an account, as
I find all his family have new hopes of him: would to God I
had

Our first day of Parliament(736) passed off harmoniously; but
in the House of Lords there was an event.  A clause of thanks
for having sent for the Hanoverians had crept into the address
of the peers--by Mr. Fox's means, as the world thinks: Lord
Temple came out of a sick bed to Oppose it.(737)  Next day
there was an alarm of an intention of instating the same
clause in our address.  Mr. Pitt went angry to court,
protesting that he would not take the seals, if any such
motion passed: it was sunk.  Next day he accepted--and the day
after, Mr. Fox, extremely disgusted with the Duke of
Devonshire for preferences shown to Mr. Pitt, retired into the
country.  The Parliament is adjourned for the reelections; and
Mr. Pitt, who has pleased in the closet, is again laid up with
the gout.  We meet on Monday, when one shall be able to judge
a little better of the temper of the winter.  The Duke of
Bedford is to be Lord Lieutenant of Ireland-no measure of
peace! Not to mention his natural warmth, every body is
sensible that he is only placed there to traverse Pitt.

Your brother and I are uneasy about your situation: when we
are treated insolently at Leghorn, to what are we sunk! Can
Mr. Pitt or the King of Prussia find a panacea for all our
disgraces? Have you seen Voltaire's epigram?

"Rivaux du Vainqueur de l'Euphrate,
L'Oncle,(738) et le Neveu;(739)
L'un fait la guerre en pirate,
L'autre en partie bleue."

It is very insipid!  It Seems to me,(740) as if Uncle and
Nephew could furnish a better epigram , unless their
reconciliation deadens wit.  Besides, I don't believe that the
Uncle of these lines means at all to be like Alexander, who
never was introduced more pompously for the pitiful end of
supplying @ rhyme.

Is it true what we see in the gazettes, that the Pantheon is
tumbled down? Am not I a very Goth, who always thought it a
dismal clumsy performance, and could never discover any beauty
in a strange mass of light poured perpendicularly into a
circle of obscurity?  Adieu! I wish you may hope more with
your elder brother than tremble with me!

(736) "The Speech from the throne, by its style and substance,
appeared to be the work of the new speech-maker: the Militia,
which his Majesty had always turned into ridicule, being
strongly recommended, the late administration censured, and
the uncourtly addresses of the preceding summer receiving the
highest commendations." Waldegrave, 88.-E.

(737) "The new Lord of the Admiralty came, as he told the
Lords, out of a sick bed, at the hazard of his life, (indeed,
he made a most sorrowful appearance,) to represent to their
lordships the fatal consequences of the intended compliment:
he said, that the people of England would be offended even at
the name of Hanover, or of foreign mercenaries, and added many
other arguments, without mentioning the true reason of his
disapprobation: namely, the Duke of Devonshire's having added
this compliment without consulting him: and, having finished
his oration, went out of the House, with a thorough conviction
that such weighty reasons must be quite unanswerable." Ibid.

354 Letter 206
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec. 16, 1756.

It will be easier for you, I fear, to guess, than for me to
describe, what I have felt for these last six days!  Your dear
brother is still alive; it is scarce possible he should be so
when you receive this.  I wrote to you this day se'nnight, the
day after I saw him last.  On that day and Friday I received
favourable messages.  I went myself on Saturday, as I had
promised him--how shocked I was at seeing Your brother Ned and
a lawyer come to the chaise: the former told me that poor Gal.
had desired the lawyer to settle his affairs, which were then
in agitation: you may imagine I did not choose to add the
tender sensations of seeing me, to what he was then feeling?
I saw our doom too plainly, though your brother Ned still had
hopes.  Every day confirmed my fears: but I could not bear my
anxiety, and went to Richmond to-day, with as much horror as
persons must go to execution yet determined to see Gal. if I
found that he had expressed the leas@ desire of it.--Alas! he
has scarce had moments of sense since Sunday morning--how can
I bring myself to say of so dreadful a situation, that it is
my greatest consolation! But I could not support the thought
of his remaining sensible of death with all those anxious
attentions about him which have composed his whole life! Oh!
my dear child, what rash wretches are heroes, compared to this
brother of yours!  Nothing ever equalled his cool solicitude
for his family and friends.  What an instance am I going to
repeat to you!  His most unhappy life was poisoned by the
dread of leaving his children and fortune to be torn to pieces
by his frantic wife, whose settlements entitled her to thirds.
On Friday, perceiving her alarmed by his danger, he had the
amazing presence of mind and fortitude to seize that only
moment of tenderness, and prevailed on her to accept a
jointure.  He instantly despatched your brother Ned to London
for his lawyer, and by five o'clock on Saturday, after
repeated struggles of passion on her side, the whole was
finished.  Dear Gal. he could not speak, but he lifted up his
hands in thanks!  While he had any sense, it was employed in
repeated kindnesses, particularly to your brother James--he
had ordered a codicil, but they have not found a sufficient
interval to get it signed!

My dearest Sir, what an afflicting letter am I forced to write
to you! but I flatter myself, you will bear it better from me,
than from any other person: and affectionate as I know you,
could I deprive you or myself of the melancholy pleasure of
relating such virtues My poorest, yet best consolation is,
that, though I think his obstinacy in not going abroad, and
Ill management, may have hurried his end, yet nothing could
have saved him; his lungs are entirely gone.  But how will you
be amazed at what I am going to tell you! His wretched wife is
gone mad--at least your brother Ned and the physician are
persuaded so--I cannot think so well of her.--I see her in so
diabolic a light, that I cannot help throwing falsehood into
the account--but let us never mention her more.  What little
more I would say, for I spare your grief rather than indulge
my own, is, that I beseech you to consider me as more and more
your friend: I adored Gal. and will heap affection on that I
already have for you.  I feel your situation, and beg of you
to manage with no delicacy, but confide all your fears and
wishes and wants to me-if I could be capable of neglecting
you, write to Gal.'s image that will for ever live in a memory
most grateful to him.

You will be little disposed or curious to hear politics; yet
it must import you always to know the situation of your
country, and 'It never was less settled.  Mr. Pitt is not yet
able to attend the House, therefore no inquiries are yet
commenced.  The only thing like business has been the affair
of preparing quarters for the Hessians, who are soon to
depart; but the Tories have shown such attachment to Mr. Pitt
on this occasion, that it is almost become a Whig point to
detain them.  The breach is so much widened between Mr. Pitt
and Mr. Fox, and the latter is so warm, that we must expect
great violences.  The Duke of Newcastle's party lies quiet;
one of the others must join it. The -new ministers have so
little weight, that they seem determined at least not to part
with their popularity: the new Secretary of State(741) is to
attack the other, lord Holderness, on a famous letter of his
sent to the mayor of Maidstone, for releasing a Hanoverian
soldier committed for theft.  You may judge what harmony there
is!

Adieu, my dear Sir! How much I pity you, and how much you
ought to pity me! Imitate your brother's firmness of Mind, and
bear his loss as well as you can.  You have too much merit not
to be sensible of his, and then it will be impossible for you
to be soon comforted.

(741) Mr. Pitt.



356 Letter 207
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Dec. 23, 1756.

I KNOW I can no more add to your concern than to my own, by
giving you the last account of your dear brother, who put a
period to our anxious suspense in the night between the 20th
and 21st.  For the five last days he had little glimmerings of
amendment, that gave hopes to some of his friends, terror to
me, who dreaded his sensibility coming to Itself! When I had
given up his life, I could not bear the return of his
tenderness!  Sure he had felt enough for his friends--yet he
would have been anxious for them if he had recovered his
senses.  He has left your brothers Edward, James, and
Foote,(742) his executors; to his daughters 7500 pounds
a-piece, and the entail of his estate in succession--to a name
I beg we may never mention, 700 pounds a-year, 4000 pounds and
his furniture, etc.  Your brother James, a very worthy man,
though you never can have two Gals. desired me to give you
this account--' how sad a return for the two letters I have
received from you this week! Be assured, my dear Sir, that
nothing could have saved his life.  For your sake and my own I
hurry from this dreadful subject-not for the amusement of'
either, or that I have any thing to tell you: my letter shall
be very short, for I am stabbing you with a dagger used on
myself!

Mr. Pitt has not been able to return to Parliament for the
gout, which has prevented our having one long day; we adjourn
to-morrow for a fortnight; yet scarce to meet then for
business, as a call of the House is not appointed till the
20th of January; very late indeed, were any inquiries
probable: this advantage I hope will be gained, that our new
ministers will have a month's time to think of their country.

Adieu! my dear Sir, this letter was necessary for me to write-
-I find it as necessary to finish it.

(742) Mr. Foote married the second sister of Mr. Mann; as his
brother, a clergyman, afterwards did the third.



356 Letter 208
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, January 6, 1757.

I live in dread of receiving your unhappy letters! I am
sensible how many, many reasons you have to lament your dear
brother; yet your long absence will prevent the loss of him
from leaving so sharp a sting as it would have done had you
seen as much of him as I have of late years! When I wrote to
you, I did not know his last instance Of love to you;(743) may
you never have occasion to use it!

I wish I could tell you any politics to abstract your thoughts
from your concern; but just at present all political
conversation centres in such a magazine of abuse, as was
scarce ever paralleled.  Two papers, called the "Test" and
"Contest," appear every Saturday, the former against Mr. Pitt,
the latter against Mr. Fox, which make me recollect-,' "Fogs"
and "Craftsmen" as harmless libels.  The authors are not
known; Doddington(744) is believed to have the chief hand in
the "Test,"(745) which is much the best, unless virulence is
to bestow the laurel.  He has been turned out by the opposite
faction, and has a new opportunity of revenge, being just
become a widower.  The best part of his fortune is entailed on
lord Temple if he has no son; but I suppose he would rather
marry a female hawker than not propagate children and
lampoons.  There is another paper, called "The Monitor,"(746)
written by one Dr. Shebbeare, who made a pious resolution of
writing himself into a place or the pillory,(747) but having
miscarried in both views, is wreaking his resentment on the
late Chancellor, who might have gratified him in either of his
objects.  The Parliament meets to-morrow, but as Mr. Pitt
cannot yet walk, we are not likely soon to have any business.
Admiral Byng's trial has been in agitation above these ten
days, and is supposed an affair of length: I think the reports
are rather unfavourable to him, though I do not find that it
is believed he will be capitally punished.  I will tell you my
sentiments, I don't know whether judicious or not: it may
perhaps take a great deal of time to prove he was not a
coward; I should think it would not take half an hour to prove
he had behaved bravely.

Your old royal guest King Theodore is gone to the place which
it is said levels kings and beggars; an unnecessary journey
for him, who had already fallen from one to the other; I think
he died somewhere in the liberties of the Fleet.(748)

lord Lyttelton has received his things, and is much content
with them; this leads me to trouble you with another, I hope
trifling, commission; will you send me a case of the best
drains for Lord Hertford, and let me know the charge?

You must take this short letter only as an instance of my
attention to you; I would write, though I knew nothing to tell
you.

(743) Mr. Galfridus Mann left an annuity to his brother Sir
Horace, in case he were recalled from Florence.

(744) George Bubb Doddington, Esq.  This report was not
confirmed.

(745) "The Test" was written principally by Arthur Murphy.  It
forms a thin folio volume,.-E.

(746) "The "Monitor" was commenced in August 1755, and
terminated in July 1759.  It is said to have been planned by
Alderman Beckford.-E.

(747) He did write himself into a pillory before, the
conclusion of that reign, and into a pension at the beginning
of the next, for one and the same kind of merit,--writing
against King William and the Revolution.

358 Letter 209
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 17, 1757.

I am still, my dear Sir, waiting for your melancholy letters,
not one of which has yet reached me.  I am impatient to know
how you bear your misfortune, though I tremble at what I shall
feel from your expressing it!  Except good Dr. Cocchi, what
sensible friend have you at Florence to share and moderate
your unhappiness?--but I will not renew it: I will hurry to
tell you any thing that may amuse it--and yet what is that any
thing; Mr. Pitt, as George Selwyn says, has again taken to his
Lit de Justice; he has been once with the King,(749) but not
at the House; the day before yesterday the gout flew into his
arm, and has again laid him up: I am so particular in this,
because all our transactions, or rather our inactivity, hang
upon the progress of his distemper.  Mr. Pitt and every thing
else have been forgot for these five days, obscured by the
news of the assassination of the King of France.(750)  I don't
pretend to tell you any circumstance of it, who must know them
better than, at least as well as, I can; war and the sea don't
contribute to dispel the clouds of lies that involve such a
business.  The letters of the foreign ministers, and ours from
Brussels, say he has been at council; in the city he is
believed dead: I hope not! We should make a bad exchange in
the Dauphin.  Though the King is weak and irresolute, I
believe he does not want sense: weakness, bigotry, and some
sense, are the properest materials for keeping alive the
disturbances in that country, to which this blow, if the man
was any thing but a madman, Will contribute.  The despotic and
holy stupidity(751) of the successor would quash the
Parliament at once. He told his father about a year ago, that
if he was King, the next day, and the Pope should bid him lay
down his crown, he would.  They tell or make a good answer for
the father, "And if he was to bid you take the crown from me,
would you!" We have particular cause to say masses for the
father: there is invincible aversion between him and the young
Pretender, whom, it is believed, nothing could make him
assist.  You may judge what would make the Dauphin assist him!
he was one day reading the reign of Nero he said, "Ma foi,
c'`etoit le plus grand sc`el`erat qui f`ut jamais; il ne lui
manquoit que d'`etre Janseniste."  I am grieving for my
favourite,(752) the Pope, whom we suppose dead, at least I
trust he was superannuated when they drew from him the late
Bull enjoining the admission of the Unigenitus on pain of
damnation; a step how unlike all the amiable moderation of his
life! In my last I told you the death of another monarch, for
whom in our time you and I have interested ourselves, King
Theodore.  He had just taken the benefit of the act of
insolvency, and went to the Old Bailey for that purpose: in
order to it, the person applying gives up all his effects to
his creditors - his Majesty was asked what effects he had?  He
replied, nothing but the kingdom of Corsica--and it is
actually registered for the benefit of the creditors.  You may
get it intimated to the Pretender, that if he has a mind to
heap titles upon the two or three medals that he coins, he has
nothing to do but to pay King Theodore's debts, and he may
have very good pretensions to Corsica.  As soon as Theodore
was at liberty, he took a chair and went to the Portuguese
minister, but did not find him at home: not having sixpence to
pay, he prevailed on the chairman to carry him to a tailor he
knew in Soho, whom he prevailed upon to harbour him; but he
fell sick the next day, and died in three more.

Byng's trial continues; it has gone ill for him, but mends; it
is the general opinion that he will come off for some severe
censure.

Bower's first part of his reply is published; he has pinned a
most notorious falsehood about a Dr. Aspinwall on his enemies,
which must destroy their credit, and will do him more service
than what he has yet been able to prove about himself.  They
have published another pamphlet against his history, but so
impertinent and scurrilous and malicious, that it will serve
him more than his own defence: they may keep the old man's
life so employed as to prevent the prosecution of his work,
but nothing can destroy the merit of the three volumes already
published, which in every respect is the best written history
I know: the language is the purest, the compilation the most
judicious, and the argumentation the soundest.

The famous Miss Elizabeth Villiers Pitt(753)  is in England;
the only public place in which she has been seen is the Popish
chapel; her only exploit, endeavours to wreak her malice on
her brother William, whose kindness to her has been excessive.
She applies to all his enemies, and, as Mr. Fox told me, has
even gone so far as to send a bundle of his letters to the
author of the Test, to prove that Mr. Pitt has cheated her, as
she calls it, of a hundred a year, and which only prove that
he once allowed her two, and after all her wickedness still
allows her one.  she must be vexed that she has no way of
setting the gout more against him! Adieu! tell me if you
receive all my letters.

(749) "The King became every day more and more averse to his
new ministers.  Pitt, indeed, had not frequent occasions of
giving offence, having been confined by the gout the greater
part of the winter; and when he made his appearance he behaved
with proper respect, so that the King, though he did not like
his speeches, always treated him like a gentleman."
Waldegrave, p. 93.-E.

(750) Lady Hervey, in a letter of the 13th, gives the
following account of Damien's attempt:--"I have barely time to
tell you the news of the day, which arrived by a courier from
France this morning to M. d'Abreu, the Spanish minister.  The
King of France was stepping into his coach to go to Bellevue,
and a fellow who seemed to be gaping and looking at the coach
en hayeur, took his opportunity, and taking aim at the King's
heart thrust his dagger into his side,--Just over against the
heart; but a lucky and sudden motion the King gave with his
elbow at that moment, turned the dagger. which made only a
slight wound in his ribs, as they say, which is judged not to
be dangerous.  The fellow was immediately secured."-E.

(751) The Dauphin, son of Louis XV., had been bred a bigot;
but, as he by no means wanted sense, he got over the
prejudices of his education, and before he died had far more
liberal sentiments.

360 Letter 210
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan. 30, 1757.

Last night I received your most melancholy letter of the 8th
of this month, in which you seem to feel all or more than I
apprehended.  As I trust to time and the necessary avocation
of your thoughts, rather than to any arguments I could use for
your consolation, I choose to say as little more as possible
on the subject of your loss.  Your not receiving letters from
your brothers as early as mine was the consequence of their
desiring me to take that most unwelcome office upon me: I
believe they have both written since, though your eldest
brother has had a severe fit of the gout: they are both
exceedingly busied in the details necessarily fallen upon
them.  That would be no reason for their neglecting you, nor I
am persuaded will they; they shall certainly want no
incitements from me, who wish and will endeavour as much as
possible to repair your loss, alas! how inadequately!  Your
brother James has found great favour from the Duke.(754)  Your
@brother Ned, who is but just come to town from his
confinement, tells me that your nephew will be in vast
circumstances; above an hundred thousand pounds, besides the
landed estate and debts! These little details related, I had
rather try to amuse you, than indulge your grief and my own;
your dear brother's memory will never be separated from mine;
but the way in which I shall show it, shall be in increased
attention to you: he and you will make me perpetually think on
both of you!

All England is again occupied with Admiral Byng; he and his
friends were quite persuaded of his acquittal.  The
court-martial, after the trial was finished, kept the whole
world in suspense for a week; after great debates and
divisions amongst themselves, and despatching messengers
hither to consult lawyers whether they could not mitigate the
article of war, to which a negative was returned, they
pronounced this extraordinary sentence on Thursday: they
condemn him to death for negligence, but acquit him of
disaffection and cowardice (the other heads of the article),
specifying the testimony of Lord Robert Bertie in his favour,
and unanimously recommending him to mercy; and accompanying
their sentence with a most earnest letter to the Lords of the
admiralty to intercede for his pardon, saying, that finding
themselves tied up from moderating the article of war, and not
being able in conscience to pronounce that he had done all he
could, they had been forced to bring him in guilty, but beg he
may be spared.  The discussions and difference of opinions, on
the sentence is incredible.  The cabinet council, I believe,
will be to determine whether the King shall pardon him or not:
some who wish to make him the scapegoat for their own
neglects, I fear, will try to complete his fate, but I should
think the new administration will not be biassed to blood by
such interested attempts.  He bore well his Unexpected
sentence, as he has all the outrageous indignities and
cruelties heaped upon him. last week happened an odd event, I
can scarce say in his favour, as the world seems to think it
the effect of the arts of some of his friends: Voltaire sent
him from Switzerland an accidental letter of the Duc de
Richelieu bearing witness to the Admiral's good behaviour in
the engagement.(755)  A letter of a very deferent cast, and of
great humour, is showed about, said to be written to Admiral
Boscawen from an old tar, to this effect:

"Sir., I had the honour of being at the taking of Port Mahon,
for which one gentleman(756) was made a lord; I was also at
the losing of Mahon, for which another gentleman(757) has been
made a lord: each of those gentlemen performed but one of
those services; surely I, who performed both, ought at least
to be made a lieutenant.  Which is all from your honour's
humble servant, etc."(758)

Did you hear that after their conquest, the French ladies wore
little towers for pompons, and called them des Mahonnoises?  I
suppose, since the attempt on the King, all their fashions
will be `a l'assassin.  We are quite in the dark still about
that history: it is one of the bad effects of living in one's
own time, that one never knows the truth of it till one is
dead!

Old Fontenelle is dead at last;(759) they asked him as he was
dying "s'il sentoit quelque mal?"  He replied, "Oui, je sens
le mal d'`etre."  My uncle, a young creature compared to
Fontenelle, is grown something between childish and mad, and
raves about the melancholy situation of politics;(760) one
should think he did not much despair of his country, when at
seventy-eight he could practice such dirty arts to intercept
his brother's estate from his brother's grandchildren!
conclusion how unlike that of the honest good-humoured Pope! I
am charmed with his bon-mot that you sent me.  Apropos! Mr,
Chute has received a present of a diamond mourning ring from a
cousin; he calls it l'anello del Piscatore.(761)

Mr. Pitt is still confined, and the House of Commons little
better than a coffee-house.  I was diverted the other day with
P`ere Brumoy's translation of Aristophanes; the Harangueses,
or female orators, who take the Government upon themselves
instead of their husbands, might be well applied to our
politics: Lady Hester Pitt, Lady Caroline Fox, and the Duchess
of Newcastle, should be the heroines of the piece; and with
this advantage, that as lysistrata is forced to put on a
beard, the Duchess has one ready grown.

Sir Charles Williams is returning, on the bad success of our
dealings with Russia.  The French were so determined to secure
the Czarina, that they chose about seven of their handsomest
young men to accompany their ambassador.  How unlucky for us,
that Sir Charles was embroiled with Sir Edward Hussey Montagu,
who could alone have outweighed all the seven! Sir Charles's
daughter, Lady Essex, had engaged the attentions of Prince
Edward,(762) who has got his liberty, and seems extremely
disposed to use it, and has great life and good-humour.  She
has already made a ball for him.  Sir Richard Lyttelton was so
wise as to make her a visit, and advise her not to meddle with
politics; that the Princess would conclude it was a plan laid
for bringing together Prince Edward and Mr. Fox!(763)  As Mr.
Fox was not just the person my Lady Essex was thinking of
bringing together with Prince Edward, she replied very
cleverly, "And my dear Sir Richard, let me advise you not to
meddle with politics neither."  Adieu!

(754) From the Duke of Cumberland, commander-in-chief of the
army.  Mr. Galfridus and James Mann were clothiers to many
regiments.

(755) Voltaire's letter to Admiral Byng was written in
English, and is as follows:@' Aux D`elices, pr`es de Gen`eve.
Sir, though I am almost unknown to you, I think 'tis my duty
to send you the copy of the letter which I have just received
from the Marshal Duc de Richelieu; honour, humanity, and
equity order me to convey it into your hands.  The noble and
unexpected testimony from one of the most candid as well as
the most generous of my countrymen, makes me presume your
judges will do you the same justice."  Sir John Barrow, in his
Life of Lord Anson, proves that these letters got into the
hands of those who were not friendly to the Admiral, and he
suspects that they never reached the unfortunate person for
whose benefit they were intended.-E.

(756) Byng, Viscount Torrington.

(757) Lord Blakeney.

(758) It is now generally believed that Byng was brave but
incapable.  He might have done more than he did; but this was
occasioned not by his want of courage, but by his want of
ability.  He was cruelly sacrificed to the fury of the people,
and to the popularity of the ministry.-D.

(759) Fontenelle died on the 9th of January, having nearly
completed his hundredth year.  M. le Cat, in his `eloge of
him, gives the following account of his dying words!--"he
reflected upon his own situation, just as he would upon that
of another man, and seemed to be observing a phenomenon.
Drawing very near his end, he said, 'This is the first death I
have ever seen;' and his physicians having asked him, whether
be was in pain, or what he felt, his answer was, 'I feel
nothing but a difficulty of existing.'"-E.

(760) The following is Lord Chesterfield's account of Sir
Charles's mental alienation, in a letter of the 4th, to his
son: "He was let blood four times on board the ship, and has
been let blood four times since his arrival here; but still
the inflammation continues very high.  He is now under the
care of his brothers.  They have written to the same
Mademoiselle John, to prevent, if they can, her coming to
England; which, when she hears, she must be as mad as he is,
if she takes the journey.  By the way, she must be une dame
aventuri`ere, to receive a note for ten thousand roubles, from
a man whom she had known only three days; to take a contract
of marriage, knowing he was married already; and to engage
herself to follow him to England."  Again, on the 22d, he
writes, "Sir C. W. is still in confinement, and, I fear, will
always be so, for he seems cum ratione sanire: the physicians
have collected all he has said and done, that indicated an
alienation of mind, and have laid it before him in writing; he
has answered it in writing too, and justifies himself by the
most plausible argument that can possibly be urged.  I
conclude this subject With pitying him, and poor human nature,
which holds its reason by so precarious a tenure.  The lady,
who you tell me is set out, en sera pour la peine et les frais
du voyage, for her note is worth no more than her
contract."-E.

(761) The Pope's seal with a ring, which is called the
Fisherman's ring.  Mr. Chute, who was unmarried, meant that
his cousin was fishing for his estate.

York.  He died in 1767, at the early age of twenty-eight.-E.

(763) Sir Charles Williams was a particular friend of Mr. Fox.



363 Letter 211
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Feb. 13, 1757.

I am not surprised to find you still lamenting your dear
brother but you are to blame, and perhaps I shall be so, for
asking and giving any more accounts of his last hours.
Indeed, after the fatal Saturday, on which I told you I was
prevented seeing him by his being occupied with his lawyer, he
had scarce an interval of sense--and no wonder!  His lawyer
has since told me, that nothing ever equalled the horrid
indecencies of your sister-in-law on that day.  Having yielded
to the settlement for which he so earnestly begged, she was
determined to make him purchase it, and in transports of
passion and avarice, kept traversing his chamber from the
lawyer to the bed, whispering her husband, and then telling
the lawyer, who was drawing the will, "Sir, Mr. Mann says I am
to have this, I am to have that!"  The lawyer at last,
offended to the greatest degree, said, "Madam, it is Mr.
Mann's will I am making, not yours!"--but here let me break it
off; I have told you all I know, and too much.  It was a very
different sensation I felt, when your brother Ned told me that
he had found seven thousand pounds in the stocks in your name.
As Mr. Chute and I know how little it is possible for you to
lay up, we conclude that this sum is amassed for you by dear
Gal.'s industry and kindness, and by a silent way of serving
you, without a possibility of his wife or any one else calling
it in question.

What a dreadful catastrophe is that of Richcourt's family!
What lesson for human grandeur! Florence, the scene of all his
triumphs and haughtiness, is now the theatre of his misery and
misfortunes!

After a fortnight of the greatest variety of opinions, Byng's
fate is still in suspense.  The court and the late ministry
have been most bitter against him; the new admiralty most
good-natured; the King would not pardon him.  They would not
execute the sentence, as many lawyers are clear that it is not
a legal one.(64)  At last the council has referred it to the
twelve judges to give their opinion: if not a favourable one,
he dies!  He has had many fortunate chances had the late
admiralty continued, one knows how little any would have
availed him.  Their bitterness will always be recorded against
themselves: it will be difficult to persuade posterity that
all the shame of last summer was the fault of Byng!  Exact
evidence of whose fault it was, I believe posterity will never
have: the long expected inquiries are begun, that is, some
papers have been moved for, but so coldly, that it is plain
George Townshend and the Tories are unwilling to push
researches that must necessarily reunite Newcastle and Fox.
In the mean time, Mr. Pitt stays at home, and holds the House
of Commons in commendam.  I do not augur very well of the
ensuing summer; a detachment is going to America under a
commander whom a child might outwit, or terrify with a
pop-gun! The confusions in France seem to thicken with our
mismanagements: we hear of a total change in the ministry
there, and of the disgrace both of Machault and D'Argenson,
the chiefs of the Parliamentary and Ecclesiastic factions.
That the King should be struck with the violence Of their
parties, I don't wonder: it is said, that as he went to hold
the lit de Justice, no mortal cried Vive le Roi! but one old
woman, for which the mob knocked her down, and trampled her to
death.

My uncle died yesterday was Se'nnight; his death I really
believe hastened by the mortification of the money vainly
spent at Norwich.  I neither intend to spend money, nor to die
of it, but, to my mortification, am forced to stand for Lynn,
in the room of his son.  The corporation still reverence my
father's memory so much, that they will not bear distant
relations, while he has sons living.  I was reading the other
day a foolish book called "l'Histoire des quatre Cic`erons;"
the author, who has taken Tully's son for his hero, says, he
piques himself on out-drinking Antony, his father's great
enemy.  Do you think I shall ever pique myself on being richer
than my Lord Bath?

Prince Edward's pleasures continue to furnish conversation: he
has been rather forbid by the Signora Madre to make himself so
common; and he has been rather encouraged by his grandfather
to disregard the prohibition.  The other night the Duke and he
were at a ball at Lady Rochford's:(765) she and Lady Essex
were singing in an inner chamber when the Princes entered, who
insisting on a repetition of the song, my Lady Essex, instead
of continuing the same, addressed herself to Prince Edward in
this ballad of Lord -Dorset-

"False friends I have as well as you,
Who daily counsel me
Fame and ambition to pursue,
And leave off loving thee--"

It won't be unamusing, I hope it will be no more than amusing,
when all the Johns of Gaunt, and Clarences, and Humphrys of
Gloucester, are old enough to be running about town, and
furnishing histories.  Adieu!

(764) Walpole, in his Memoires, vol. it. p. 152, says, that
Mr. Pitt moved the King to mercy, but was cut very short; nor
did his Majesty remember to ask his usual question, whether
there were any favourable circumstances."-E.

364 Letter 212
To John Chute, Esq.(766)
Sunday night, very late, Feb. 27, 1757.

My dear Sir,
I should certainly have been with YOU to-night, as I desired
George Montagu to tell you, but every six hours produce such
new wonders, that I do not know when I shall have a moment to
see you.  Will you, can you believe me, when I tell you that
the four persons of the court-martial whom Keppel named
yesterday to the House as commissioning him to ask for the
bill, now deny they gave him such commission, though Norris,
one of them, was twice on Friday with Sir Richard Lyttelton,
and once with George Grenville for the same purpose!  I have
done nothing but traverse the town tonight from Sir Richard
Lyttelton's to the Speaker's, to Mr. Pitt's, to Mr. Fox's, to
Doddington's, to Lady Hervey's, to find out and try how to
defeat the evil of this, and to extract, if possible, some
good from it.  Alas!  alas! that what I meant so well, should
be likely only to add a fortnight to the poor man's misery!
Adieu!

(766) Now first published.



365 Letter 213
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 3, 1757.

I have deferred writing to you till I could tell you something
certain of the fate of Admiral Byng: no history was ever so
extraordinary, or produced such variety of surprising turns.
In my last I told you that his sentence was referred to the
twelve judges.  They have made law of that of which no man
else could make sense.  The Admiralty immediately signed the
warrant for his execution on the last of February--that is,
three signed: Admiral Forbes positively refused, and would
have resigned sooner.  The Speaker would have had Byng
expelled the House, but his tigers were pitiful.  Sir Francis
Dashwood tried to call for the court-martial's letter, but the
tigers were not so tender as that came to.  Some of the
court-martial grew to feel as the execution advanced: the city
grew impatient for it.  Mr. Fox tried to represent the new
ministry as compassionate, and has damaged their popularity.
Three of the court-martial applied on Wednesday last to Lord
Temple to renew their solicitation for mercy.  Sir Francis
Dashwood moved a repeal of the bloody twelfth article: the
House was savage enough; yet Mr. Doddington softened them, and
not one man spoke directly against mercy.  They had nothing to
fear: the man,(767) who, of all defects, hates cowardice and
avarice most, and who has some little objection to a mob in
St. James's street, has magnanimously forgot all the services
of the great Lord Torrington.  On Thursday seven of the
court-martial applied for mercy: they were rejected.  On
Friday a most strange event happened.  I was told at the House
that Captain Keppel and Admiral Norris desired a bill to
absolve them from their oath of secrecy, that they might
unfold something very material towards saving the prisoner's
life.  I was out of Parliament myself during my re-election,
but I ran to Keppel; he said he had never spoken in public,
and could not, but would give authority to any body else.  The
Speaker was putting the question for the orders of the day,
after which no motion could be made: it was Friday, the House
would not sit on Saturday, the execution was fixed for Monday.
I felt all this in an instant, dragged Mr. Keppel to Sir
Francis Dashwood, and he on the floor before he had taken his
place, called out to the Speaker, and though the orders were
passed, Sir Francis was suffered to speak.  The House was
wondrously softened: pains were taken to prove to Mr. Keppel
that he might speak, notwithstanding his oath; but he adhering
to it, he had time given him till next morning to consider and
consult some of his brethren who had commissioned him to
desire the bill.  The next day the King sent a message to our
House, that he had respited Mr. Byng for a fortnight, till the
bill could be passed, and he should know whether the Admiral
was unjustly condemned.  The bill was read twice in our House
that day, and went through the committee: mr. Keppel affirming
that he had something, in his opinion, of weight to tell, and
which it was material his Majesty should know, and naming four
of his associates who desired to be empowered to speak.  On
Sunday all was confusion on news that the four disclaimed what
Mr. Keppel had said for them.  On Monday he told the House
that in one he had been mistaken; that another did not declare
off, but wished all were to be compelled to speak; and from
the two others he produced a letter upholding him in what he
had said.  The bill passed by 153 to 23.  On Tuesday it was
treated very differently by the Lords.  The new Chief
Justice(768) and the late Chancellor(769) pleaded against Byng
like little attorneys, and did all they could to stifle truth.
That all was a good deal.  They prevailed to have the whole
courtmartial at their bar.  Lord Hardwicke urged for the
intervention of a day, on the pretence of a trifling cause of
an Irish bankruptcy then depending before the Lords, though
Lord Temple showed them that some of the captains and admirals
Were under sailing orders for America.  But Lord Hardwicke and
Lord Anson were expeditious enough to do what they wanted in
one night's time: for the next day, yesterday, every one of
the court-martial defended their sentence, and even the three
conscientious said not one syllable of their desire of the
bill, which was accordingly unanimously rejected, and with
great marks of contempt for the House of Commons.

This is as brief and as clear an abstract as I can give you of
a most complicated affair, in which I have been a most
unfortunate actor, having to my infinite grief, which I shall
feel till the man is at peace, been instrumental in
protracting his misery a fortnight, by what I meant as the
kindest thing I could do.  I never knew poor Byng enough to
bow to; but the great doubtfulness of his crime, and the
extraordinariness of his sentence, the persecution of his
enemies, who sacrifice him for their own guilt and the rage of
a blinded nation, have called forth all my pity for him.  His
enemies triumph, but who can envy the triumph of murder?

Nothing else material has happened, but Mr. Pitt's having
moved for a German subsidy, which is another matter of triumph
to the late ministry.  He and Mr. Fox have the warmest
altercations every day in the House.

We have had a few French symptoms; papers were fixed on the
Exchange, with these words, "Shoot Byng, or take care of your
King;" but this storm, which Lord Anson's creatures and
protectors have conjured up, may choose itself employment when
Byng is dead.

Your last was of Jan. 29th, in which I thank you for what you
say of my commissions: sure you could not imagine that I
thought you neglected them?  Adieu!

(767) The King.

(768) W. Murray, Lord Mansfield.

(769) Philip Yorke, Earl of Hardwicke.



367 Letter 214
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 17, 1757.

Admiral Byng's tragedy was completed on Monday-a perfect
tragedy, for there were variety of incidents, villany, murder,
and a hero!  His sufferings, persecutions, aspersions,
disturbances, nay, the revolutions of his fate, had not in the
least unhinged his mind; his whole behaviour was natural and
firm.  A few days before, one of his friends standing by him,
said, "Which of us is the tallest?" He replied, "Why this
ceremony? I know what it means; let the man come and measure
me for my coffin."  He said, that being acquitted of
cowardice, and being persuaded on the coolest reflection that
he had acted for the best, and should act so again, he was not
unwilling to suffer.  he desired to be shot on the
quarter-deck, not where common malefactors are; came out at
twelve, sat down in a chair, for he would not kneel, and
refused to have his face covered, that his countenance might
show whether he feared death; but being told that it might
frighten his executioners, he submitted, gave the signal at
once, received one shot through the head, another through the
heart, and fell.  Do cowards live or die thus?  Can that man
want spirit who only fears to terrify his executioners?  Has
the aspen Duke of Newcastle lived thus? Would my Lord
Hardwicke die thus, even supposing he had nothing on his
conscience?

This scene is over! what will be the next is matter of great
uncertainty.  The new ministers are well weary of their
situation; without credit at court, without influence in the
House of Commons, undermined every where, I believe they are
too sensible not to desire to be delivered of their burthen,
which those who increase yet dread to take on themselves.  Mr.
Pitt's health is as bad as his situation: confidence between
the other factions almost impossible; yet I believe their
impatience will prevail over their distrust.  The nation
expects a change every day, and being a nation, I believe,
desires it; and being the English nation, will condemn it the
moment it is made.  We are trembling for Hanover, and the Duke
is going to command the army of observation.  These are the
politics of the week; the diversions are balls, and the two
Princes frequent them; but the eldest nephew(770) remains shut
up in a room, where, as desirous as they are of keeping him, I
believe he is now and then incommode.  The Duke of Richmond
has made two balls on his approaching wedding with Lady Mary
Bruce, Mr. Conway's(771) daughter-in-law: it is the perfectest
match in the world; youth, beauty, riches, alliances, and all
the blood of all the kings from Robert Bruce to Charles the
Second.  they are the prettiest couple in England, except the
father-in-law and mother.

As I write so often to you, you must be content with shorter
letters, which, however, are always as long as I can make
them.  This summer will not contract our correspondence.
Adieu! my dear Sir.

(770) George Prince of Wales, afterwards George III.

(771) Lady Mary Bruce was only daughter of Charles last Earl
of Ailesbury, by his third wife, Caroline, daughter of General
John Campbell, afterwards Duke of Argyll. lady Ailesbury
married to her second husband, Colonel Henry Seymour Conway,
only brother of Francis Earl of Hertford.



368 Letter 215
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 7, 1757.

You will receive letters by this post that will surprise you;
I will try to give you a comment to them; an exact explication
I don't know who could give you.  You will receive the orders
of' a new master, Lord Egremont.  I was going on to say that
the ministry is again changed, but I cannot say Changed, it is
only dismissed--and here is another inter-ministerium.

The King has never borne Lord Temple,(772) and soon grew
displeased with Mr. Pitt: on Byng's affair it came to
aversion.  It is now given out that both I have mentioned have
personally affronted the King.  On the execution, he would not
suffer Dr. Hay of the admiralty to be brought into Parliament,
though he had lost his seat on coming into his service.
During this squabble negotiations were set on foot between the
Duke of Newcastle and Mr. Fox, and would have been concluded
if either of them would have risked being hanged for the
other.  The one most afraid broke off the treaty; need I say
it was the Duke?(773 While this was in agitation, it grew
necessary for the Duke(774) to go abroad and take the command
of the army of observation.  He did not care to be checked
there by a hostile ministry at home: his father was as
unwilling to be left in their hands.  The drum was beat for
forces; none would list.  However, the change must be made,
The day before yesterday Lord Temple was dismissed, with all
his admiralty but Boscawen, who was of the former, and with an
offer to Mr. Elliot to stay, which he has declined.  The new
admirals are Lord Winchelsea, Rowley again, Moyston, Lord
Carysfort, Mr. Sandys, and young Hamilton of the board of
trade.(775)  It was hoped that this disgrace would drive Mr.
Pitt and the rest of his friends to resign--for that very
reason they would not.  The time pressed; to-day was fixed for
the Duke's departure, and for the recess of Parliament during
the holidays.  Mr. Pitt was dismissed, and Lord Egremont has
received the seals to-day.  Mr. Fox has always adhered to
being only paymaster; but the impossibility of finding a
chancellor of the exchequer, which Lord Duplin of the
Newcastle faction, and Doddington of Mr. Fox's, have refused,
has, I think, forced Mr. Fox to resolve to take that post
himself.  However, that and every thing else is unsettled, and
Mr. Fox is to take nothing till the Inquiries are over.  The
Duke of Devonshire remains in the treasury, declaring that it
is only for a short time, and till they can fix on somebody
else.  The Duke of Newcastle keeps aloof, professing no
connexion with Mr. Pitt; Lord Hardwicke is gone into the
country for a fortnight.  The stocks fall, the foreign
ministers stare; Leicester-house is going to be very angry,
and I fear we are going into great confusion.  As I wish Mr.
Fox so well, I cannot but lament the undigested rashness of
this measure.

Having lost three packet-boats lately, I fear I have missed a
letter or two of yours: I hope this will have better fortune;
for, almost unintelligible, as it is, you will want even so
awkward a key.

Mr. Fox was very desirous of bargaining for a peerage for Lady
Caroline; the King has positively refused it, but has given
him the reversion for three lives of clerk of the pelts in
Ireland, which Doddington has now.  Mr. Conway is made groom
of the bedchamber to the King.

A volume on all I have told you would only perplex you more;
you will have time to study what I send you now.  I go to
Strawberry Hill to-morrow for the holidays; and till they are
over, certainly nothing more will be done.  You did not expect
this new confusion, just when you was preparing to tremble for
the campaign.  Adieu!

(772) "To Lord Temple," says Lord Waldegrave, "the King had
the strongest aversion, his lordship having a pert
familiarity, which is not always agreeable to his Majesty.
besides, in the affair of admiral Byng, he had used some
insolent expressions, which his Majesty could never forgive.
Pitt, he said, made him long speeches, which probably might be
very fine, but were greatly beyond his comprehension, and that
his letters were affected, formal, and pedantic; but as to
Temple, he was so disagreeable a fellow, there was no bearing
him." Memoirs, p. 93.-E.

(773) "I told his Majesty, that the Duke of Newcastle was quite
doubtful what part he should take, being equally balanced by
fear on the one side and love of power on the other.  To this
the King replied, 'I know he is apt to be afraid, therefore go
and encourage him; tell him I do not look upon myself as king
whilst I am in the hands of these scoundrels; that I am
determined to get rid of them at any rate; that I expect his
assistance, and that he may depend on my favour and
protection.'" Waldegrave, p. 96.-E.

(774) The Duke of Cumberland.

(775) The new admiralty actually consisted of the following:--
Lord Winchilsea, Admiral Sir W. Rowley, K. B., Hon. Edward
Boscawen, Gilbert Elliott, Esq., John Proby, first lord
Carysfort, Savage Mostyn, Esq., and the Hon. Edward Sandys,
afterwards second lord Sandys.-D.



370 Letter 216
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 20, 1757.

You will wonder that I should so long have announced my lord
Egremont to you for a master, without his announcing himself  to
you.--it was no fault of mine; every thing here is a riddle  or
an absurdity.  Instead of coming forth secretary of state,  he
went out of town, declaring he knew nothing of the matter.   On
that, it was affirmed that he had refused the seals.  The  truth
is, they have never been offered to him in form.  He had  been
sounded, and I believe was not averse, but made excuses  that
were not thought invincible.  As we are in profound peace  with
all the world, and can do without any government, it is  thought
proper to wait a little, till what are called the  Inquiries are
over;(776) what they are, I will tell you
presently.  A man(777) who has hated and loved the Duke of
Newcastle pretty heartily in the course of some years, is
Willing to wait, in hopes of prevailing on him to resume the
seals--that Duke is the arbiter of England! Both the other
parties are trying to unite with him.  The King pulls him, the
next reign (for you know his grace is very young) pulls him
back.  Present power tempts: Mr. Fox's unpopularity terrifies-
-he will reconcile all, with immediate duty to the King, with  a
salvo to the intention of betraying him to the Prince, to  make
his peace with the latter, as soon as he has made up with  the
former.  Unless his grace takes Mr. Fox by the hand, the  latter
is in an ugly situation--if he does, is he in a beautiful one?


Yesterday began the famous and long-expected Inquiries.(778)
The House of Commons in person undertakes to examine all the
intelligence, letters, and orders, of the administration that
lost Minorca.  In order to this, they pass over a -,,whole
winter; then they send for cart-loads of papers from all the
offices, leaving it to the discretion of the clerks to
transcribe, insert, omit, whatever they please; and without
inquiring what the accused ministers had left or secreted.
Before it was possible for people to examine these with any
attention, supposing they were worth any, the whole House goes
to work, sets the clerk to reading such bushels of letters,  that
the very dates fill three-and-twenty sheets of paper; he  reads
as fast as he can, nobody attends, every body goes away,  and
to-night they determined that the whole should be read  through
on tomorrow and Friday, that one may have time to  digest on
Saturday and Sunday what one had scarce heard,
cannot remember, nor is it worth the while; and then on
Monday, without asking any questions, examining any witnesses,
authority, or authenticity, the Tories are to affirm that the
ministers were very negligent; the Whigs, that they were
wonderfully informed, discreet, provident, and active; and Mr.
Pitt and his friends are to affect great zeal for justice, are
to avoid provoking the Duke of Newcastle, and are to endeavour
to extract from all the nothings they have not heard,
something that is to lay all the guilt at Mr. Fox's door.  Now
you know very exactly what the Inquiries are-and this wise
nation is gaping to see the chick which their old brood-hen  the
House of Commons will produce from an egg laid in
November, neglected till April, and then hatched in a
quicksand!

The common council have presented gold boxes with the freedom
of their city to Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge--no gracious
compliment to St. James's.  It is expected that the example
will catch, but as yet, I hear of no imitations.  Pamphlets,
cards, and prints swarm again.  George Townshend has published
one of the latter, which is so admirable in its kind, that I
cannot help sending 'It to you.  His genius for likenesses in
caricatura is astonishing--indeed, Lord Winchelsea's figure is
not heightened--your friends Doddington and Lord Sandwich are
like; the former made me laugh till I cried.  The Hanoverian
drummer, Ellis, is the least like, though it has much of his
air.  I need say nothing of the lump of fat(779) crowned with
laurel on the altar.  As Townshend's parts lie entirely in his
pencil, his pen has no share in them; the labels are very  dull,
except the inscription on the altar, which I believe is  his
brother Charles's.  This print, which has so diverted the  town,
has produced to-day a most bitter pamphlet against
George Townshend, called The Art of Political Lying.  Indeed,
it is strong.

The Duke, who has taken no English with him but Lord
Albemarle, Lord Frederick Cavendish,(780) Lord George
Lennox,(781) Colonel Keppel, Mr. West, and Colonel Carlton,  all
his own servants, was well persuaded to go by Stade; there  were
French parties laid to intercept him on the other road.   It
might have saved him an unpleasant campaign.  We have no
favourable events, but that Russia, who had neither men,
money, nor magazines, is much softened, and halts her troops.
The Duke of Grafton(782) still languishes: the Duke of
Newcastle has so pestered him with political visits, that the
physicians ordered him to be excluded: yet he forced himself
into the house.  The Duke's Gentlemen would not admit him into
the bedchamber, saying his grace was asleep.  Newcastle
protested he would go in on tiptoe and only look at him-he
rushed in, clattered his heels to waken him, and then fell  upon
the bed, kissing and hugging him.  Grafton waked.  "God!  what's
here?"  "Only I, my dear lord."  Buss, buss, buss,  buss!  "God!
how can you be such a beast, to kiss such a
creature as I am, all over plaisters! get along, get along!"
and turned about and went to sleep.  Newcastle hurries home,
tells the mad Duchess that the Duke of Grafton was certainly
light-headed, for he had not known him, frightened her into
fits, and then was forced to send for Dr. -Shaw-for this
Lepidus are struggling Octavius and Anthony!(783)

I have received three letters from you, one of March 25th, one
of the second of this month, inclosing that which had
journeyed back to you unopened.  I wish it lay in my way to
send you early news of the destination of fleets, but I rather
avoid secrets than hunt them.  I must give you much the same
answer with regard to Mr. Dick, whom I should be most glad to
serve; but when I tell you that in the various revolutions of
ministries I have seen, I have never asked a single favour for
myself or any friend I have; that whatever friendships I have
with the man, I avoid all connexions with the minister; that I
abhor courts and levee-rooms and flattery; that I have done  with
all parties and only sit by and smile--(you would
weep)--when I tell You all this, think what my interest must
be!  I can better answer your desiring me to countenance your
brother James, and telling me it will cost me nothing.  My  God!
if you don't believe the affection I have for you, at  least
believe in the adoration I have for dear Gal.'s memory,-  -that,
alas! cannot now be counterfeited!  If ever I had a  friend, if
ever there was a friend, he was one to me; if ever  there were
love and gratitude, I have both for him--before I  received your
letter, James was convinced for all this--but my  dear child, you
let slip an expression which sure I never  deserved--but I will
say no more of it.  thank you for the  verses on
Buondelmonti(784)--I did not know he was dead--for  the prayer
for Richcourt, for the Pope's letter, and for the  bills of
lading for the liqueurs.

You will have heard all the torments exercised on that poor
wretch Damien, for attempting the least bad of all murders,  that
of a king.  They copied with a scrupulous exactness
horrid precedents, and the dastardly monarch permitted them!   I
don't tell you any particulars, for in time of war, and at  this
distance, how to depend on the truth of them?

This is a very long letter, but I will not make excuses for
long ones and short ones too--I fear you forgive the long ones
most easily!

ordered from the King, by Lord Holderness to come and kiss his

372 Letter 217
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 5, 1757.

You may expect what you please of new ministries, and
revolutions, and establishments; we are a grave people, and
don't go so rashly to work-at least when we have demolished  any
thing rashly, we take due time before we repair it.  At a
distance you may be impatient.  We, the most concerned, wait
very tranquilly to see the event of chaos.  It was given out
that nothing would be settled till the Inquiries were at an  end.
The world very obediently stayed for the time appointed.   The
Inquiries are at an end, yet nothing is in more
forwardness.  Foreign nations may imagine (but they must be at
a great distance!) that we are so wise and upright a people,
that every man performs his part, and thence every thing goes  on
in its proper order without any government--but I fear, our  case
is like what astronomers tell us, that if a star was to  be
annihilated, it would still shine for two months.  The  Inquiries
have been a most important and dull farce, and very  fatiguing;
we sat six days till past midnight.  If you have  received my
last letter, you have already had a description of  what passed
just as I foresaw.  Mr. Pitt broke out a little  the second day,
and threatened to secede, and tell the world  the iniquity of the
majority; but recollecting that the
majority might be as useful as the world, he recomposed
himself, professed meaning no personalities, swallowed all
candour as fast as it was proposed to him, swallowed camels  and
haggled about gnats, and in a manner let the friends of  the old
ministry state and vote what resolutions they pleased.   They
were not modest, but stated away; yet on the last day of  the
committee, on their moving that no greater force could  have been
sent to the Mediterranean than was under Byng the  triumphant
majority shrank to one of seventy-eight, many
absenting themselves, and many of the independent sort voting
with the minority.  This alarmed so much, that the
predetermined vote of acquittal or approbation was forced to  be
dropped, and to their great astonishment the late cabinet  is not
thanked parliamentarily for having lost Minorca.  You  may judge
what Mr. Pitt might have done, if he had pleased;  when, though
he starved his own cause, so slender an advantage  was obtained
against him.  I retired before the vote I have  mentioned; as Mr.
Fox was complicated in it, I would not
appear against him, and I could not range myself with a
squadron who I think must be the jest of Europe and posterity.
It now remains to settle some ministry: Mr. Pitt's friends are
earnest, and some of them trafficking for an union with
Newcastle.  He himself, I believe, maintains his dignity, and
will be sued to, not sue.  The Duke of Newcastle, who cannot
bear to resign the last twilight of the old sun, would join  with
Fox; but the Chancellor, who hates him, and is alarmed at  his
unpopularity, and at the power of Pitt with the people,  holds
back.  Bath, Exeter, Yarmouth, and Worcester, have
followed the example of london, and sent their freedoms to  Pitt
and Legge: I suppose Edinburgh will, but instead of
giving, will ask for a gold box in return.  Here are some new
epigrams on the present politics:

TO THE NYMPH OF BATH.
Mistaken Nymph, thy gifts withhold;
Pitt's virtuous soul despises gold;
Grant him thy boon peculiar, health;
He'll guard, not covet, Britain's wealth.

Another.
The two great rivals London might content,
If what he values most to each she sent;
Ill was the franchise coupled with the box:
Give Pitt the freedom, and the gold to Fox.

ON DR.  SHEBBEAR ABUSING Hume CAMPBELL FOR BEING A PROSTITUTE
ADVOCATE.
'Tis below you, dear Doctor to worry an elf,
Who you know will defend $any thing but himself.

The two first are but middling, and I am bound to think the
last so, as it is my own.  Shebbear is a broken Jacobite
physician, who has threatened to write himself into a place or
the pillory: he has Just published a bitter letter to the Duke
of Newcastle, which occasioned the above two lines.

The French have seized in their own name the country of
Bentheim, a purchase of the King's, after having offered him
the most insulting neutrality for Hanover, in the world; they
proposed putting a garrison into the strongest Post(785) he  has,
with twenty other concessions.  We have rumours of the  Prince of
Bevern having beaten the Austrians considerably.
I believe, upon review, that this is a mighty indefinite
letter; I would have waited for certainties, but not knowing
how long that might be, I thought you would prefer this
parenthesis of politics.

lord Northumberland's great gallery is finished and opened; it
is a sumptuous chamber, but might have been in a better taste.
He is wonderfully content with his pictures, and gave me leave
to repeat it to you.  I rejoiced, as you had been the
negotiator--as you was not the painter, you will allow me not
to be so profuse of my applause. Indeed I have yet only seen
them by candle-light.  Mengs's School of Athens pleased me:
Pompeio's two are black and hard; Mazucci's Apollo, fade and
without beauty; Costanza's piece is abominable.  Adieu! till a
ministry.

374 Letter 218
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 19, 1757.

We are not yet arrived at having a ministry, but we have had
two or three alarms at one.  On Monday, the Duke of
Devonshire, impatient for a plaything, took the chamberlain's
staff and key--these were reckoned certain prognostics; but  they
were only symptoms Of his childishness.  Yesterday it was
published that Mr. Pitt's terms were so extravagant, that the
Duke of Newcastle could not comply with them--and would take  the
whole himself--perhaps leave some little trifle for Mr.
Fox--to-day all is afloat again, and all negotiations to
recommence.  Pitt's demands were, that his grace should not
meddle in the House of Commons, nor in the province of
Secretary of State, but stick to the Treasury, and even there
to be controlled by a majority of Mr. Pitt's friends-they were
certainly great terms, but he has been taught not to trust  less.
But it is tautology to dwell on these variations; the
inclosed(786 is an exact picture of our situation--and is
perhaps the only political paper ever written, in which no man
of any party can dislike or deny a single fact.  I wrote it in
an hour and a half, and you will perceive that it must be the
effect of a single thought.

We had big letters yesterday of a total victory of the King of
Prussia over the Austrians,(787) with their army dispersed and
their general wounded and prisoner--I don't know how, but it  is
not confirmed yet.  You must excuse the brevity of my
English letter, in consideration of my Chinese one.  Adieu!
(786) Letter from Xo Ho, a Chinese philosopher at London, to
his friend Lien Chi at Pekin.

(787) This was the battle of Prague, gained by the King of
Prussia on the 6th of May, 1757, over the forces of the
Empress-Queen, commanded by Prince Charles of Lorraine.-D.



375 Letter 219
To George Montagu, Esq.
May 27, 1757.

I have ticketed you with numbers 5832, 58322, 58323, 58324,
58325, 58326; I think you bespoke six.  I do not send them by
post, unless you order it: but I have writ your name on each,
lest in case of accident my executors should put them into my
auction, for which you are so impatient, and then you would  have
to buy them over again.

I am glad you like Xo Ho: I think every body does, which is
strange, considering it has no merit but truth.  Mrs. Clive
cried out like you, "Lord! you will be sent to the Tower!"
"Well," said I coolly, "my father was there before me."

Lord Abercorn's picture is extremely like; he seems by the
Vandyke habit to be got back into his own times; but nothing  is
finished yet, except the head.

You will be diverted with a health which my Lady Townshend  gave
at supper with the Prince t'other night: "'Tis a health  you will
all like," she said.  "Well! what is it?"  "The three  P's."  The
boy coloured up to the eyes.  After keeping them in  suspense
some time, she named, Pitt, Peace, and Plenty.  The  Princess has
given Home, the author of Douglas, a hundred a  year.  Prince and
Princess Edward continue to entertain
themselves and Ranelagh every night.

I wish your brother and all heirs to estates joy, for old  Shutz
is dead, and cannot wriggle himself into any more wills.   The
ministry is not yet hatched; the King of Prussia is
conquering the world; Mr. Chute has some murmurs of the gout;
and I am yours for ever.



376 Letter 220
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 1, 1757.

After a vacancy of full two months, we are at last likely to
have a ministry again--I do not promise you a very lasting  one.
Last Wednesday the conferences broke off between the  Duke of
Newcastle and Mr. Pitt; the latter demanding a full  restoration
of his friends, with the admiralty and a peerage  for Mr. Legge,
the blue riband and, I believe, Ireland for  Lord Temple, and Mr.
Grenville for chancellor of the
exchequer, with stipulations that no more money should be sent
this year to Germany.  The last article, the admiralty, and
especially the exchequer, were positively refused; and on  Friday
the Duke went to the King, and consented to be sole  minister,
insisting that Mr. Fox should be nothing but
paymaster, not cabinet-councillor, and have no power; Sir
Thomas Robinson to be again secretary of state, and Sir George
Lee chancellor of exchequer.  For form, he was to retire to
Claremont for a few days, to take advice of his oracle, whose
answer he had already dictated.  Lord Hardwicke refuses the
seals; says, he desires nobody should be dismissed for him; if
president or privy seal should by any means be vacant, he will
accept either, but nothing till Lord Anson is satisfied, for
whom he asks treasurer of the navy.  The Duke goes to
Kensington to-morrow, when all this is to be declared-however,
till it is, I shall doubt it.  Lord Lincoln and his principal
friends are vehement against it; and indeed his grace seems to
be precipitating his own ruin.  If Mr. Fox could forgive all
that is past, which he by no means intends, here are now
provocations added--will they invite Mr. Fox's support? Not to
mention what Unpopular German steps the Duke must take to
recover the King's favour, who is now entirely Fox's; the  latter
is answerable for nothing, and I believe would not  manage
inquiries against his grace as Mr. Pitt has--leniently.   In
short, I think the month of October will terminate the  fortunes
of the house of Pelham for ever--his supporters are  ridiculous;
his followers will every day desert to one or  other of the two
princes(788) of the blood, who head the other  factions.  Two
parts in three of the cabinet, at least half,  are attached to
Mr. Fox; there the Duke will be overborne; in  Parliament will be
deserted.  Never was a plan concerted with  more weakness!

I enclose a most extraordinary print.  Mr. Fox has found some
caricaturist(789) equal to George Townshend, and who manages
royal personages with at least as little ceremony.  I have
written "Lord Lincoln" over the blue riband, because some  people
take it for him--likeness there is none: it is certain  Lord
Lincoln's mother was no whore; she never recovered the  death of
her husband.  The line that follows "son of a whore"  seems but
too much connected with it; at least the "could say  more" is not
very merciful.  The person of Lord Bute, not his  face, is
ridiculously like; Newcastle, Pitt, and Lord Temple  are the very
men.  It came out but to-day, and shows how
cordial the new union is.  Since the Ligue against Henry III.
of France, there never was such intemperate freedom with
velvet and ermine; never, I believe, where religion was not
concerned.

I cannot find by the dates you send me that I have received
yours of Jan. 1, and Feb. 12, and I keep all your letters very
orderly.  Mine of this year to you have been of Jan. 6, 17,  30;
Feb. 14; March 3 , 17; April 7, 20; May 5, 19.  Tell me if  you
have received them.

What a King is our Prussian! how his victories come out
doubled and trebled above their very fame! My Lady Townshend
says, "Lord! how all the Queens will go to see this Solomon!  and
how they will be disappointed!"  How she of Hungary is
disappointed!  We hear that the French have recalled their  green
troops, which had advanced for show, and have sent their  oldest
regiments against the Duke.(790)  Our foreign affairs  are very
serious, but I don't know whether I do not think that  our
domestic tend to be more so! Adieu!

(788) The Prince of Wales, who espoused Mr. Pitt; and the Duke
of Cumberland, Mr. Fox.

(789) This relates to a print that made much noise, called  "The
Turnstile." The uncertain figure pretended to be Lord  Lincoln,
but was generally thought to mean the Prince of
Wales, whom it resembled; but in the second impression a
little demon was inserted to imply ,The Devil over Lincoln."
Yet that evasion did not efface the first idea.

(790) The Duke of Cumberland.



377 Letter 221
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, June 2, 1757.

The ministry is to be settled to-day; there are different
accounts how: some say, that the Duke of Newcastle is to take
orders and to have the reversion of the bishopric of
Winchester: that Mr. Pitt is to have a regiment and to go  serve
in Germany with the Duke; that Mr. Fox is to have Sir  William
Irby'S place,(791) and be chamberlain to the Princess;  that my
Lord Bute is to be divorced and marry Princess Emily;  and that
my Lord Darlington is to be first minister.  Others  say, that
the Duke of Newcastle is to be sole minister, having  broken with
Mr. Pitt; that Sir Thomas Robinson is to be again  secretary of
state; Sir George Lee chancellor of the
exchequer, and Mr. Fox paymaster, but with no place in the
cabinet, nor any power.  I believe the Duke himself has said
this; but, as I think the former establishment would be the  less
ridiculous of the two, I intend to believe that.

I send you your tickets and a curious new print.  The blue
riband in the corner, and the line that explains it, but
leaves it still in the dark, makes much noise.  I choose to
think it my Lord Lincoln, for, having a tenderness for
royalties, I will not suppose, as most do, that it points
higher.  The rest are certainly admirable: the times are very
entertaining; one cannot complain that no Wit is stirring, as
one used to do. I never thought I should feel glad for the  death
of poor Mr. Pelham; but really it has opened such scenes  of
amusement, that I begin to bear it better than I did.  I  rejoice
to hear that your brother is accommodated, though not  by my
means.  The Duke of Bedford might have reflected, that  what I
asked was a very trifle, or that I should never have  asked it;
nay, that if I could have asked a favour of
consequence, I should not have applied to himself, but to  those
who govern him,--to the Duchess and Rigby.

I certainly am glad of rain, but could wish it was boiled a
little over the sun first: Mr. Bentley calls this the hard
summer, and says he is forced to buy his fine weather at
Newcastle.  Adieu!

P. S. Pray acknowledge the receipt of your tickets.  I don't
know how you came not to see the advertisements of Xo Ho,  which
have been in continually; four editions were published  in twelve
days.

(791) Vice-chamberlain to the Princess of wales.



378 Letter 222
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 9, 1757.

I must write you a very different story from my last.  The day
before yesterday the Duke of Newcastle, who had resumed
conferences with Mr.  Pitt by the intervention of Lord Bute,
though they could not agree on particulars, went to
Kensington, and told the King he could not act without Mr.  Pitt
and a great plan of that connexion.  The King reproached  him
with his breach of promise; It seems the King is in the  wrong
for Lord Lincoln and that court reckon his grace as  white as
snow, and as steady as virtue itself.  Mr. Fox went  to court,
and consented to undertake the whole--but it is  madness!  Lord
Waldegrave,(792) a worthy man as ever was born,  and sensible, is
to be the first lord of his treasury.  Who is  to be any thing
else I don't know, for by to-morrow it will  rain resignations as
it did in the year '46.  Lord Holderness  has begun, and gave up
to-day; the Dukes of Rutland and Leeds  and all these Pelhamites
are to follow immediately: the
standard of opposition is, I believe, ready painted, and is to
be hung out at Leicester-house by the beginning of the week.   I
grieve for Mr. Fox, and have told him so: I see how
desperate his game is, but I shall not desert him, though I
mean nor meant to profit of his friendship.  So many places  will
be vacant, that I cannot yet guess who will be to fill  them.
Mr. Fox will be chancellor of the exchequer, and, I  think, Lord
Egremont one of the secretaries of state.  What is  certain,
great clamour, and I fear.  great confusion, will  follow.  You
shall know more particulars in a few days, but at  present I have
neither time for it, nor knowledge of, more.   Adieu!

(792) James second Earl Waldegrave, and first Husband to Maria
Duchess of gloucester.



379 Letter 223
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 14, 1757.

This is Tuesday; I wrote to you but on Thursday, and promised  to
write again in a few days--a week cannot pass without a new
revolution.  On Friday Mr. Fox found that his kissing hands  was
to be a signal for the resignations: Lord Rockingham and  Lord
Coventry were the most eager to give up.  The Duke of  Newcastle,
transported that his breach of promise and
ingratitude to the King produced such noble mischief,
endeavoured to spread the flame as wide as possible.  On
Saturday, Mr. Fox and Lord Waldegrave represented the ugly
situation of their affairs, and advised against persisting,  yet
offering to proceed if commanded.  The Chief Justice, who  was to
carry the exchequer seal that morning, enforced this--  "Well,"
said the King, "go tell the others to make what
ministry they can; I only insist on two things, that Lord
Winchilsea remain where he is, and that Fox be paymaster."
These two preliminaries would be enough to prevent the whole,  if
there were no other obstacles.  Lord Winchilsea, indeed,  would
not act with Newcastle and Pitt, if they would consent;  but
there are twenty other impediments: Leicester-house can  never
forgive or endure Fox; and if they could, his and
Winchilsea's remaining would keep their friends from
resigning, and then how would there be room for Newcastle's
zealots or Pitt's martyrs?  But what I take to be most
difficult of all, is the accommodation between the chiefs
themselves: his grace's head and heart seem to be just as  young
and as old as ever they were; this triumph will
intoxicate him; if he could not agree with Pitt, when his
prospect was worst, be will not be more firm or more sincere
when all his doublings have been rewarded.  If his vainglory
turns his head, it will make no impression on Pitt, who is as
little likely to be awed by another's pageant, as to be
depressed by his own slender train.  They can't agree--but  what
becomes of us? There are three factions, just strong  enough to
make every thing impracticable.

The willing victim, Lord Holderness, is likely to be the most
real victim.  His situation was exactly parallel to Lord
Harrington's,(793) with the addition of the latter's
experience.  Both the children of fortune, unsupported by
talents, fostered by the King's favour, without connexions or
interest, deserted him to please this wayward Duke, who, to
recover a little favour in the cabinet, sacrificed the first  to
the King@s resentment, and has prepared to treat the other  in
the same manner, by protesting that he did not ask the
compliment.  But no matter for him! I have already told you,  and
I repeat, that I see no end to these struggles without  great
convulsions.  The provocations, and consequently the
resentments, increase with every revolution.  Blood royal is
mixed in the quarrels: two factions might cease by the victory
of either; here is always a third ready to turn the scale.
Happily the people care or interest themselves very little  about
all this-but they will be listed soon, as the chiefs  grow so
much in earnest, and as there are men of such vast  property
engaged on every side-there is not a public pretence  on any.
The scramble is avowedly for power-whoever remains  master of the
field at last, I fear, will have power to use  it!

This is not the sole uneasiness at Kensington; they know the
proximity of the French army to the Duke, and think that by  this
time there may have been an action: the suspense is not
pleasant: the event may have great consequences even on these
broils at home.  For the King of Prussia, he is left to the
coffee-houses.  Adieu! I can scarce steal a day for
Strawberry; if one leaves London to itself for four-and-twenty
hours, one finds it topsy-turvy.

(793) William Stanhope, Earl of Harrington, who, though a
younger brother, had been raised to an earldom, to be Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, and Secretary of State, had been the
first man to resign his place in 1746, when the King, his  master
and benefactor, had a mind to remove the Pelhams, and  make Lord
Granville prime minister.  He was afterwards
sacrificed by the Pelhams to please the King.  Lord Holderness
was born to an earldom, but having little fortune or parts,  had
been promoted by the Duke of Newcastle to great posts.


380 Letter 224
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, June 20, 1757.

I renounce all prophesying; I will never suppose that I can
foresee politically; I can foresee nothing, what ever I may
foretell.  Here is a ministry formed of all the people who for
these ten weeks have been giving each other exclusion!  I will
now not venture, even to pronounce that they cannot agree
together.  On Saturday last, the 18th, Lord Hardwicke carried  to
Kensington the result of the last negotiations between  Newcastle
and Pitt, and the latter followed and actually
kissed hands again for the seals.(794)  Here is the
arrangement as far as I know it, the most extraordinary part  of
which is, that they suffer Mr. Fox to be paymaster--oh! no,  it
is more extraordinary that he will submit to be so.  His  grace
returns to the treasury, and replaces there his singular  good
friend Mr. Legge.  Lord Holderness "comes to life again  as
secretary of state; Lord Anson reassumes the admiralty, not  with
the present board, nor with his own, but with Mr. Pitt's,  and
this by Mr. Pitt's own desire.  The Duke of Dorset retires  with
a pension of 4000 pounds a-year, to make room for Lord  Gower,
that he may make room for Lord Temple.  Lord George  Sackville
forces out Lord Barrington from secretary at war,  who was going
to resign with the rest, for fear Mr. Fox
should, and that this plan should not take place.  Lord
Hardwicke, young disinterested creature! waits till something
drops.  Thus far all was smooth; but even this perfection of
harmony and wisdom meets with rubs.  Lord Halifax had often  and
lately been promised to be erected into a secretary of  state for
the West Indies.  Mr. Pitt says, "No, I will not  part with so
much power."  Lord Halifax resigned on Saturday,  and Lord Dublin
succeeds him.  The two Townshends are gone  into the country in a
rage; Lord Anson is made the pretence;  Mr. Fox is the real sore
to George, Lord G. Sackville to
Charles.  Sir George Lee, who resigned his treasurership to  the
Princess against Mr. Pitt, and as the world says, wanting  to
bring Lord Bute into Doctors' Commons,(795) is succeeded by  Lord
Bute's brother M'Kinsy; but to be sure, all this, in  which there
is no intrigue, no change, no policy, no hatred,  no jealousy, no
disappointment, no resentment, no
mortification, no ambition, Will produce the utmost concord!  It
is a system formed to last; and to be sure it will! In the  mean
time, I shall bid adieu to politics; my curiosity is  satisfied
for some months, and I shall betake myself to
employments I love better, and to this place, which I love  best
of all.  Here is the first fruit of my retirement; behind  a
bas-relief in wax of the present Pope I have writ the
following inscription:

Prospero Lambertini
Bishop of Rome
by the name of Benedict IV.
who, though an absolute Prince, reigned as harmlessly as a  Doge
of Venice.  He restored the lustre of the Tiara by those  arts
alone, by which alone he obtained it, his Virtues.
Beloved by Papists, esteemed by Protestants: A Priest without
insolence or interest; A Prince without favourites; A Pope
without nepotism: An Author without vanity; In short, a Man  whom
neither Wit nor Power could spoil.  The Son of a
favourite Minister, but One, who never courted a Prince, nor
worshipped a Churchman, offers, in a free Protestant Country,
this deserved Incense to the Best of the Roman Pontiffs.

If the good old soul is still alive, and you could do it
unaffectedly and easily, you may convey it to him; it must be  a
satisfaction to a good heart to know that in so distant a
country, so detached from his, his merit is acknowledged,
without a possibility of interest entering into the
consideration.  His death-bed does not want comfort or
cheerfulness, but it may be capable of an expansion of heart
that May still sweeten it! Adieu!

(794) "On the day they were all to kiss hands," says Lord
Waldegrave, "I went to Kensington, to entertain myself with  the
innocent, or, perhaps, ill-natured amusement of examining  the
different countenances.  The behaviour of Pitt and his  party was
decent and sensible; they had neither the insolence  of men who
had gained a victory, nor were they awkward and  disconcerted,
like those who come to a place where they know  they are not
welcome: but as to the Duke of Newcastle, and his  friends the
resigners, there was a mixture of fear and of  shame on their
countenances: they were real objects of
compassion."  Memoires, 138.-E.

(795) Meaning the offence he took at Lord Bute's favourite.   Sir
George Lee was a civilian.



382 Letter 225
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, July 3, 1757.

I have been under great uneasiness about you; Coloredo, the
Austrian minister, is recalled precipitately, with orders not  to
take leave.  our papers joined Pucci(796) with him in this
recall, but I do not find with any foundation. However, I  cannot
be easy while your situation is precarious.  One should  conceive
that the advantages of the English trade to Tuscany  would induce
the Emperor to preserve a neutrality; but what  are good reasons
against his wife's vengeance and obstinacy,  and haughtiness?
Tell me immediately what you think or hear on  this head; what
steps you would take; whither you would retire  if this should
happen; whether you would not come home to  watch over your own
interest and return, or whether you would  be more in the way by
remaining in Italy.  I know not what to  advise; I don't even
know how this letter is to get to you,  and how our
correspondence will continue; at least it must be  very
irregular, now all communication is cut off through the
Empress's dominions.  I am in great solicitude!

Had this recall happened a week later I should not have
wondered: it was haughty, indeed, at the time it was dictated;
but two days, and we heard of the reversal of all the King of
Prussia's triumphs; of his being beat by Count Daun; of the
siege of Prague being raised: of Prince Charles falling on  their
retreat and cutting off two thousand: we would willingly  not
believe to the extent of all this,(797) yet we have known  what
it is to have our allies or ourselves beaten!  The Duke  has been
forced to pass the Weser, but writes that the French  are so
distressed for provisions that he hopes to repass it.
I notified to you the settlement of the ministry, and,
contrary to late custom, have not to unnotify it again.
However, it took ten days to complete, after an
inter-ministerium of exactly three months.  I have often
called this the age of abortions; for the present, the
struggles of the three factions, that threatened such
disturbances, have gone off like other forebodings.  I think I
told you in my last the chief alterations; the King would not
absolutely give the secretary at war to Lord George Sackville;
Lord Barrington remains: the Duke of Dorset would not take a
pension eo nomine; his cinque-ports are given to him for life,
with a salary of four thousand pounds a-year.  Lord
Cholmondeley, who is removed for Potter, has a pension equal  to
his place.  Mr. M'Kinsy is not treasurer to the Princess,  as I
told you.  One of the most extraordinary parts of the new  system
is the advancement of Sir Robert Henley.  He was made
attorney-general by Mr. Fox at the end of last year, and made  as
bad a figure as might be.  Mr. Pitt insisting upon an
attorney-general of his own, Sir Robert Henley is made lord
keeper!(798)  The first mortification to Lord Holderness has
been, that, having been promised a garter as well as Lord
Waldegrave, and but one being vacant, that one, contrary to
customs has been given to the latter, with peculiar marks of
grace.  I now come to your letter of June 18th, and attribute  to
your distance, or to my imperfect representations of our  actors
and affairs, that you suppose our dissensions owing to  French
intrigues--we want no foreign causes; but in so
precarious a letter as this I cannot enter into farther
explanations; indeed the French need not be at any trouble to
distract or weaken our councils!

I cannot be at peace while your fate is in suspense; I shall
watch every step that relates to it, but I fear absolutely
impotent to be of any service to you: from Pucci's not being
recalled, I would hope that he will not be.  Adieu!

P. S. Lord Dublin is not yet first lord of trade; there are
negotiations for recovering Lord Halifax.

July 5th.

As I was sending this to London I received the newspapers of
yesterday, and see that old Pucci is just dead.  I cannot help
flattering myself that this is a favourable event: they cannot
recall no minister; and when they do not, I think we shall  not.

(796) Resident from Florence.  He was here for fifty years,  and
said he had seen London twice built.  This meant, that  houses
are run up so slightly that they last but few years.

(797) the King of Prussia had been completely beaten at Kolin  by
the Austrians, commanded by Count Daun, on the 17th of  June.  He
was in consequence obliged to retreat from Bohemia,  and soon
found himself, surrounded as he was by increasing and  advancing
enemies, in one of the most critical positions of  his whole
military life.  From this he at length extricated  himself, by
means of the victories of Rosbach and Lissa.-D.

(798) Afterwards created Lord Henley, and made lord
chancellor, and finally elevated to be Earl of Northington-D.



383 Letter 226
To The Earl Of Strafford.
Strawberry Hill, July 4, 1757.

My dear Lord,
It is well I have not obeyed you sooner, as I have often been
going to do.- what a heap of lies and contradictions I should
have sent you!  What joint ministries and sole ministries!  What
acceptances and resignations!--Viziers and bowstrings  never
succeeded one another quicker.  Luckily I have stayed  till we
have got an administration that will last a little  more than for
ever.  There is such content and harmony in it,  that I don't
know whether it is not as perfect as a plan which  I formed for
Charles Stanhope, after he had plagued me for two  days for news.
I told him the Duke of Newcastle was to take  orders, and have
the reversion of the bishopric of Winchester;  that Mr. Pitt was
to have a regiment, and go over to the Duke;  and Mr. Fox to be
chamberlain to the Princess, in the room of  Sir William Irby.
Of all the new system I believe the happiest is Offley; though in
great humility he says he only  takes the bedchamber to
accommodate.  Next to him in joy is  the Earl of Holderness--who
has not got the garter.  My Lord  Waldegrave has; and the garter
by this time I believe has got  fifty spots.(799)

Had I written sooner, I should have told your lordship, too,  of
the King of Prussia's triumphs-but they are addled too!  I  hoped
to have had a few bricks from Prague to send you towards
building Mr. Bentley's design, but I fear none will come from
thence this summer.  Thank God, the happiness of the menagerie
does not depend upon administrations or victories!  The
happiest of beings in this part of the world is my Lady
Suffolk: I really think her acquisition and conclusion of her
lawsuit will lengthen her life ten years.  You may be sure I  am
not so satisfied, as Lady Mary(800) has left Sudbroke.
Are your charming lawns burnt up like our humble hills? Is  your
sweet river as low as our deserted Thames?--I am wishing  for a
handful or two of those floods that drowned me last year  all the
way from Wentworth Castle.  I beg my best compliments  to my
lady, and my best wishes that every pheasant egg and  peacock egg
may produce as many colours as a harlequin-jacket.

Tuesday, July 5.

Luckily, my good lord, my conscience had saved its distance.   I
had writ the above last night, when I received the honour of
your kind letter this morning.  You had, as I did not doubt,
received accounts of all our strange histories.  For that of  the
pretty Countess,(801) I fear there is too much truth in  all you
have heard: but you don't seem to know that Lord
Corydon and Captain Corydon(802) his brother have been most
abominable.  I don't care to write scandal; but when I see  you,
I will tell you how much the chits deserve to be whipped.   Our
favourite general(803) is at his camp: lady Ailesbury  don't go
to him these three weeks.  I expect the pleasure of  seeing her
and Miss Rich and Fred. Campbell here soon for a  few days.  I
don't wonder your lordship likes St. Philippe  better than
Torcy:(804) except a few passages interesting to  Englishmen,
there cannot be a more dry narration than the  latter.  There is
an addition of seven volumes of Universal  History to Voltaire's
Works, which I think will charm you: I  almost like it the best
of his works.(805)  It is what you  have seen extended, and the
Memoirs of Louis XIV. refondues in  it.  He is a little tiresome
with contradicting La Beaumelle  out of pique--and there is too
much about Rousseau.  Between  La Beaumelle and Voltaire, one
remains with scarce a fixed  idea about that time.  I wish they
would produce their authorities and proofs; without which, I am
grown to believe  neither.  From mistakes in the English part, I
suppose there  are great ones in the more distant histories; yet
altogether  it is a fine work.  He is, as one might believe,
worst informed on the present times.  He says eight hundred
persons  were put to death for the last rebellion-I don't believe
a  quarter of the number were: and he makes the first ]lord
Derwentwater--who, poor man! was in no such high-spirited
mood--bring his son, who by the way was not above a year -,ind  a
half old, upon the scaffold to be sprinkled with his blood.
However, he is in the right to expect to be believed: for he
believes all the romances in Lord Anson's Voyage, and how
Admiral Almanzor made one man-of-war box the ears of the whole
empire of China!--I know nothing else new but a new edition of
Dr. Young's Works.  If your lordship thinks like me, who hold
that even in his most frantic rhapsodies there are innumerable
fine things you will like to have this edition.  Adieu, once
more, my best lord!

Argyle, and sister to Lady Strafford.

385 Letter 227
To John Chute, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 12, 1757.

It would be very easy to persuade me to a Vine-voyage,(806)
without your being so indebted to me, if it were possible.  I
shall represent my impediments, and then you shall judge. I  say
nothing of the heat of this magnificent weather, with the  glass
yesterday up to three-quarters of sultry.  In all
English probability this will not be a hindrance long; though
at present, so far from travelling, I have made the tour of my
own garden but once these three days before eight at night,  and
then I thought I should have died of it.  For how many  years we
shall have to talk of the summer of fifty-seven!--But  hear: my
Lady Ailesbury and Miss Rich come hither on Thursday  for two or
three days; and on Monday next the Officina
Arbuteana opens in form.  The Stationers' Company, that is,  Mr.
Dodsley, Mr. Tonson, etc., are summoned to meet here on  Sunday
night.  And with what do you think we open?  Cedite,  Romani
Impressores--with nothing under Graii Carmina.  I found  him in
town last week: he had brought his two Odes to be
printed.  I snatched them out of Dodsley's hands, and they are
to be the first fruits of my press.  An edition of Hentznerus,
with a version by Mr. Bentley and a little preface of mine,  were
prepared, but are to wait.  Now, my dear sir, can I stir?
"Not ev'n thy virtues, tyrant, shall avail!"

Is not it the plainest thing in the world that I cannot go to
you yet, but that you must come to me?

I tell you no news, for I know none, think of none.  Elzevir,
Aldous, and Stephens are the freshest personages in my memory.
Unless i was appointed printer of the Gazette, I think nothing
could at present make me read an article in it.  Seriously you
must come to us, and shall be witness that the first holidays  we
have I will return with you.  Adieu!

(806) To visiting Mr. Chute at the Vine, his seat in
Hampshire.




386 Letter 228
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 16, 1757.

You do me justice in believing that I enjoy your satisfaction;  I
do heartily, and particularly on this point: you know how  often
I have wished this reconciliation: indeed you have taken  the
handsomest manner of doing it, and it has been accepted
handsomely.  I always had a good opinion of your cousin, and I
am not apt to throw about my esteem lightly.  He has ever
behaved with sense and dignity, and this country has more
obligations to him than to most men living.

the weather has been so hot, and we are so unused to it, that
nobody knew how to behave themselves; even Mr. Bentley has  done
shivering.

Elzevirianum opens to-day; you shall taste its first fruits.   I
find people have a notion that it is very mysterious; they  don't
know how I should abhor to profane Strawberry Hill with
politics.  Adieu!



386 Letter 229
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Thursday, 17.

I only write you a line to tell you, that as you mention Miss
Montagu's being well and alone, if she could like to accompany
the Colonel(807) and you to Strawberry Hill and the Vine, the
seneschals of those castles will be very proud to see her.  I  am
sorry to be forced to say any thing civil in a letter to  you;
you deserve nothing but ill-usage for disappointing us so  often,
but we stay till we have got you into our power, and  then--why
then, I am afraid we shall still be what I have been  so long.

(807) mr. Montagu's brother.



387 Letter 230
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, July 25, 1757.

The Empress-Queen has not yet hurt my particular.  I have
received two letters from you within this week, dated July 2d
and 9th.  Yet she has given up Ostend and Nieuport, and, I
think, Furnes and Ypr`es, to the French.  We are in a piteous
way!  The French have passed the Weser, and a courier
yesterday brought word that the Duke was marching towards  them,
and within five miles: by this time his fate is decided.   The
world here is very inquisitive about a secret  expedition(808)
which we are fitting out: a letter is not a  proper place to talk
about it; I can only tell you, that be it  whither it will, I do
not augur well about it, and what makes  me dislike it infinitely
more, Mr. Conway is of it.  I am more  easy about your situation
than I was, though I do not like the  rejoicings ordered at
Leghorn for the victory over the Prussians.

I have so little to say to-day that I should not have writ,  but
for one particular reason.  The Mediterranean trade being
arrived, I concluded the vases for Mr. Fox were on board it,  but
we cannot discover them.  Unluckily it happens that the  bill of
lading is lost, and I have forgot in what ship they  were
embarked.  In short, my dear Sir, I think that, as I  always used
to do, I gave the bill to your dearest brother, by  which means
it is lost.  I imagine you have a duplicate.  send  it as soon as
you can.

I thank you for what you have given to Mr. Phelps.  I don't  call
this billet part of the acknowledgment.  All the world is
dispersed: the ministers are at their several villas: one day  in
a week serves to take care of a nation, let it be in as bad  a
plight as it will! We have a sort of Jewish superstition,  and
would not come to town on a Saturday or Sunday though it  were to
defend the Holy of Holies.  Adieu!

(808) the expedition to Rochfort.



387 Letter 231
To John Chute, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 26, 1757.

I love to communicate my satisfactions to you.  You will
imagine that I have got an original portrait of John
Guttemburg, the first inventor of printing, or that I have met
with a little boke called Eneyr dos, which I am going to
translate and print.  No, no; far beyond any such thing! Old
Lady Sandwich(809) is dead at Paris, and my lord has given me
her picture of Ninon l'Enclos; given it me in the prettiest
manner in the world.  I beg if he should ever meddle in any
election in Hampshire, that you will serve him to the last  drop
of your shrievalty.  If you reckon by the thermometer of  my
natural impatience, the picture would be here already, but  I
fear I must wait some time for it.

The press goes on as fast as if I printed myself.  I hope in a
very few days to send you a specimen, though I could wish you
was at the birth of the first produce.  Gray has been gone  these
five days.  Mr. Bentley has been ill, and is not
recovered of the sweating-sickness, which I now firmly believe
was only a hot summer and England, being so unused to it, took
it for a malady.  mr. Muntz is not gone; but pray don't think
that I keep him: he has absolutely done nothing this whole
summer but paste two chimney-boards.  In short, instead of
Claude Lorrain, he is only one of Bromwich's men.

You never saw any thing so droll as Mrs. Clive's countenance,
between the heat of the summer, the pride in her legacy,(810)
and the efforts to appear concerned.

We have given ourselves for a day or two the air of an
earthquake, but it proved an explosion of the powder-mills at
Epsom.  I asked Louis if it had done any mischief: he said,
"Only blown a man's head off;" as if that was a part one could
spare!

P. S. I hope Dr. Warburton will not think I encroach either  upon
his commentatorship or private pretension, if I assume  these
lines of Pope, thus altered, for myself:

"Some have for wits, and then for poets pass'd
turn'd printers next, and proved plain fools at last."

(809) Daughter of the famous Wilmot Earl of Rochester.

(810) A legacy of fifty pounds, left her by John Robarts, the
last Earl of Radnor of that family.



388 Letter 232
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, August 4, 1757.

Mr. Phelps (who is Mr. Phelps?) has brought me the packet  safe,
for which I thank you.  I would fain have persuaded him  to stay
and dine, that I might ask him more questions about  you.  He
told me how low your immaterial spirits are: I fear  the news
that came last night will not exalt them.  The French  attacked
the Duke for three days together, and at last
defeated him.  I find it is called at Kensington an
encounter(811) of fourteen squadrons; but any defeat must be
fatal to Hanover.  I know few particulars, and those only by a
messenger despatched to me by Mr. Conway on the first tidings:
the Duke exposed himself extremely, but is unhurt, as they  say,
all his small family are.  In what a situation is our  Prussian
hero, surrounded by Austrians, French, and
Muscovites-even impertinent Sweden is stealing in to pull a
feather out of his tail!  What devout plunderers will every
little Catholic prince of the empire become! The only good I
hope to extract out of this mischief is, that it will stifle  our
secret expedition, and preserve Mr. Conway from going on  it.  I
have so ill an opinion of our secret expeditions, that  I hope
they will for ever remain so.  What a melancholy
picture is there of an old monarch at Kensington, who has  lived
to see such inglorious and fatal days!  Admiral Boscawen  is
disgraced.  I know not the cause exactly, as ten miles out  of
town are a thousand out of politics.  He is said to have  refused
to serve under Sir Edward Hawke in this armament.   Shall I tell
you what, more than distance, has thrown me Out  of attention to
news? A little packet which I shall give your  brother for you,
will explain it.  In short, I am turned
printer, and have converted a little cottage here into a
printing-office.  My abbey is a perfect colicue or academy.  I
keep a painter in the house and a printer--not to mention Mr.
Bentley, who is an academy himself.  I send you two copies  (one
for Dr. Cocchi) of a very honourable opening of my press-  -two
amazing Odes of Mr. Gray; they are Greek, they are
Pindaric, they are sublime! consequently I fear a little
obscure; the second particularly, by the confinement of the
measure and the nature of prophetic vision, is
mysterious.(812)  I could not persuade him to add more notes;
he says whatever wants to be explained, don't deserve to be.   I
shall venture to place some in Dr. Cocchi's copy, who need  not
be supposed to understand Greek- and English together,  though he
is so much master of both separately.  To divert you  in the mean
time, I send you the following copy of a letter  written by my
printer(813) to a friend in Ireland.  I should  tell you that he
has the most sensible look in the world;  Garrick said he would
give any money for four actors with such  eyes--they are more
Richard the Third's than Garrick's own;  but whatever his eyes
are, is head is Irish.  Looking for  something I wanted in a
drawer, I perceived a parcel of
strange romantic words in a large hand beginning a letter; he
saw me see it, yet left it, which convinces me it was left on
purpose: it is the grossest flattery to me, couched in most
ridiculous scraps of poetry, which he has retained from things
he has printed; but it will best describe itself:--

"SIR,
"I DATE this from shady bowers, nodding groves, and
amaranthine shades,--close by old Father Thames's silver side-
-fair Twickenham's luxurious shades--Richmond's near
neighbour, where great George the King resides.  You will
wonder at my prolixity--in my last I informed you that I was
going into the country to transact business for a private
gentleman.  This gentleman is the Hon. Horatio Walpole, son to
the late great Sir Robert Walpole, who is very studious, and  an
admirer of all the liberal arts and sciences; amongst the  rest
he admires printing.  He has fitted out a complete
printing-house at this his country seat, and has done me the
favour to make me sole manager and operator (there being no  one
but myself).  All men of genius resorts his house, courts  his
company, and admires his understanding--what with his own  and
their writings, I believe I shall be pretty well
employed.--I have pleased him, and I hope continue so to do.
Nothing can be more warm than the weather has been here this
time past; they have in London, by the help of glasses,
roasted in the artillery-ground fowls and quarters of lamb.
The coolest days that I have felt since May last are equal to,
nay, far exceed the warmest I ever felt in Ireland.  The place  I
am in now is all my comfort from the heat--the situation Of  it
is close to the Thames, and is Richmond Gardens (if you  were
ever in them) in miniature, surrounded by bowers, groves,
cascades, and ponds, and on a rising ground, not very common  in
this part of the country--the building elegant, and the
furniture of a peculiar taste, magnificent and superb He is a
bachelor, and spends his time in the studious rural taste--not
like his father, lost in the weather-beaten vessel of state--
many people censured, but his conduct was far better than our
late pilots at the helm, and more to the interest of England-
-they follow his advice now, and court the assistance of
Spain, instead of provoking a war, for that was ever against
England's interest."

I laughed for an hour at this picture of myself, which is much
more like to the studious magician in the enchanted opera of
Rinaldo; not but Twickenham has a romantic genteelness that
would figure in a more luxurious climate.  It was but
yesterday that we had a new kind of auction-it was of the
orange-trees and plants of your old acquaintance, Admiral
Martin.  It was one of the warm days of this jubilee summer,
which appears only once in fifty years--the plants were
disposed in little clumps about the lawn: the company walked  to
bid from one to the other, and the auctioneer knocked down  the
lots on the orange tubs.  Within three doors was an
auction of china. You did not imagine that we were such a
metropolis!  Adieu!

obscurity: nobody knows what we would be at: one man, a  peer, I
have been told of, that think's -the last stanza of  The second
Ode relates to Charles the First and Oliver
Cromwell; in short, the zuveroi appear to be still fewer than
even, I expected." Works, vol. iii. p. 165-E.

To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Aug. 4, 1757.

I shall to-morrow deliver to your agentess, Mrs. Moreland,
something to send to you.

The Duke(814) is beaten by the French; he and his family are
safe; I know no more particulars-if I did, I should say, as I
have just said to Mr. Chute, I am too busy about something to
have time to write them.  Adieu!

(814) The Duke of Cumberland, in the affair of Hastenbeck.



391 Letter 234
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Strawberry Hill, August 14, 1757.

You are too kind to me, and, if it were possible, would make  me
feel still more for your approaching departures.(815)  I  can
only thank you ten thousand times; for I must not
expatiate, both from the nature of the subject, and from the
uncertainty of this letter reaching you.  I was told
yesterday, that you had hanged a French spy in the Isle of
Wight; I don't mean you, but your government.  Though I wish  no
life taken away, it was some satisfaction to think that the
French were at this hour wanting information.

Mr. Fox breakfasted here t'other day.  He confirmed -what you
tell me of Lord Frederick Cavendish's account: it is
universally said that the Duke failed merely by inferiority,
the French soldiers behaving in general most scandalously.   They
had fourscore pieces of cannon, but very ill served.   Marshal
D'Estr`ees was recalled before the battle, but did not  know it.
He is said to have made some great mistakes in the  action.  I
cannot speak to the truth of it, but the French are  reported to
have demanded two millions sterling of Hanover.
My whole letter will consist of hearsays: for, even at so
little distance from town, one gets no better news than
hawkers and pedlars retail about the country.  From such I  hear
that George Haldane(816) is made governor of Jamaica, and  that a
Mr. Campbell, whose father lives in Sweden, is going  thither to
make an alliance with that country, and hire twelve  thousand
men.  If one of my acquaintance, as an antiquary,  were alive,
Sir Anthony Shirley,,(817) I suppose we should  send him to
Persia again for troops; I fear we shall get none  nearer!

Adieu! my dearest Harry! Next to wishing your expedition
still-born, my most constant thought is, how to be of any
service to poor Lady Ailesbury, whose reasonable concern makes
even that of the strongest friendship seem trifling.  Yours  most
entirely.

(815) On the expedition to Rochfort.

(816) Brigadier-General Haldane.

(817) Sir Thomas, Sir Anthony, and Sir Robert Shirley, were
three brothers, all great travellers, and all distinguished by
extraordinary adventures in the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and
James I.



392 Letter 235
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, August 25, 1757.

I did not know that you expected the pleasure of seeing the
Colonel so soon.  It is plain that I did not solicit leave of
absence for him; make him my many compliments.  I should have
been happy to have seen you and Mr. John, but must not regret
it, as you were so agreeably prevented.  You are very
particular, I can tell you, in liking Gray's Odes--but you  must
remember that the age likes Akenside, and did like
Thomson! can the same people like both?  Milton was forced to
wait till the world had done admiring Quarles.  Cambridge told
me t'other night that my Lord Chesterfield heard Stanley read
them as his own, but that must have been a mistake of my
lord's deafness.  Cambridge said, "Perhaps they are Stanley's;
and not caring to own them, he gave them to Gray."  I think  this
would hurt Gray's dignity ten times more than his poetry  not
succeeding.  My humble share as his printer has been more
favourably received.  We proceed soberly.  I must give you
account of less amusements, des eaux de Strawberry.  T'other  day
my Lady Rochfort, Lady Townshend, Miss Bland,(818) and the
knight of the garter dined here, and were carried into the
printing-office, and were to see the man print.  There were  some
lines ready placed, which he took off; I gave them to  Lady
Townshend; here they are-

"The press speaks:
>From me wits and poets their glory obtain;
Without me their wit and their verses were vain.
Stop, Townshend, and let me but print what you say;
You, the fame I on others bestow, will repay."

They then asked, as I foresaw, to see the man compose: I gave
him four lines out of the Fair Penitent, which he set; but  while
he went to place them in the press, I made them look at
something else without their observing, and in an instant he
whipped away what he had just set, and to their great surprise
when they expected to see "Were ye, ye fair," he presented to  my
Lady Rochford the following lines:-

"The press speaks:
In vain from your properest name you have flown,
And exchanged lovely Cupid's for Hymen's dull throne;
By my art shall your beauties be constantly sung,
And in spite of yourself you shall ever be young."

You may imagine, whatever the poetry was, that the gallantry  of
it succeeded.  Poor Mr. Bentley has been at the extremity  with a
fever, and inflammation in his bowels; but is so well  recovered
that Mr. Muntz is gone to fetch him hither to-day.   I don't
guess what sight I have to come in Hampshire, unless  it is
Abbotstone.  I am pretty sure I have none to come at the  Vine,
where I have done nothing, as I see Mr. Chute will never  execute
any thing.  The very altar-piece that I sent for to  Italy is not
placed yet.  But when he could refrain from
making the Gothic columbarium for his family, which I propose,
and Mr. Bentley had drawn so divinely, it is not probable he
should do any thing else.  Adieu!

(818) Sister of the unfortunate Sir John Bland.  See ant&, p.
287, letter 157.-E.



393 Letter 236
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(819)
Strawberry Hill, Thursday, Sept. 2, 1757.

Not being in town, there may be several more new productions,
as the Grubbaea frutex blossoms every day; but I send you all  I
had gathered for myself, while I was there.  I found the
pamphlet much in vogue; and, indeed, it is written smartly.   My
Lady Townshend sends all her messages on the backs of these
political cards; the only good one of which the two heads  facing
one another, is her son George's.  Charles met D'Abreu  t'other
day, and told him he intended to make a great many  speeches next
winter; the first, said he, shall be to address  the King not to
send for any more foreign troops, but to send  for some foreign
ministers.

My Lord Chesterfield is relapsed: he sent Lord Bath word
lately, that be was grown very lean and deaf: the other
replied, that he could lend him some fat, and should be very
glad at any time to lend him an ear.

I shall go to town on Monday, and if I find any thing else  new,
I will pack it up with a flower picture for Lady
Ailesbury, which I shall leave in Warwick-street, with orders
to be sent to you.  Adieu!

393 Letter 237
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 3, 1757.

having intended a journey into Warwickshire to see Lady
Hertford while my lord is in Ireland, and having accordingly
ordered my letters thither, though without going, I did not
receive yours of the 22d till last week; and though you
desired an immediate acknowledgment of it, I own I did defer
till I could tell you I had been at Linton,(820) from whence I
returned yesterday.  I had long promised your brother a visit;
the immediate cause was very melancholy, and I must pass over  it
rapidly-in short, I am going to place an urn in the church  there
to our dear Gal.! If I could have divested myself of  that
thought, I should have passed my time very happily; the  house is
fine, and stands like the citadel of Kent; the whole  county is
its garden.  So rich a prospect scarce wants my  Thames.  Mr. and
Mrs. Foote(821) are settled there, two of the  most agreeable and
sensible people I ever met.  Their eldest  boy has the finest
countenance in the world; your nephew
Hory(822) was there too, and has a sweetness of temper, as if
begot between your brother and you, and not between him and  his
Tusephone.  Your eldest brother has not only established  your
sister Foote there, which looks well, but dropped very  agreeable
hints about Hory.

Your letter has confirmed my satisfaction about your situation
about which indeed I am easy.  I am persuaded you will remain  at
Florence as long as King George has any minister there.  I  do
not imagine that a recall obliges you to return home;
whether you could get your appointments continued is very
different.  It is certainly far from unprecedented: nay, more
than one have received them at home--but that is a favour far
beyond my reach to obtain.  Should there be occasion, you must
try all your friends, and all that have professed themselves  so;
your Mr. Pelham(823) might do something.  In the mean  time,
neglect none of the ministers.  If you could wind into a
correspondence with Colonel Yorke,(824) at the Hague, he may  be
of great service to you.  That family is very Powerful: the
eldest brother, Lord Royston,(825) is historically curious and
political: if without its appearing too forced, you could at  any
time send him uncommon letters, papers, manifestoes', and  things
of that sort, it might do good service.  My dear child,  I can
give you better advice than assistance: I believe I have  told
you before, that I should rather hurt you than serve you  by
acting openly for you.

I told you in my last Admiral Boscawen's affair too strongly:
he is not disgraced nor dismissed, but seems to reckon himself
both.  The story is far from exactly known: what I can sift  out
is, that he indulged himself in a great latitude in a most
profitable station, was recalled against his inclination, for
the present expedition; not being easily met, a second
commander was appointed, whom it seems he did not much care to
serve under at first.  He does not serve at all, and his
Boscawenhood is much more Boscawened; that is surely in the
deepest shade.  The wind has blown so constantly west for  nearly
three weeks, that we have not only received no mails  from the
continent, but the transports have been detained in  the Downs,
and the secret expedition has remained at anchor.   I have prayed
it might continue, but the wind has got to the  east to-day.
Having never been prejudiced in favour of this  exploit, what
must I think of it when the French have had such  long notice?

We had a torrent of bad news yesterday from America, Lord
Loudon has found an army of twenty-one thousand French, gives
over the design on Louisbourg, and retires to Halifax.
Admiral Holbourn writes, that they have nineteen ships to his
seventeen, and he cannot attack them.  It is time for England  to
slip her own cables, and float away into some unknown
ocean!

Between disgraces and an inflammation in my eyes, it is time  to
conclude my letter.  My eyes I have certainly weakened with
using them too much at night.  I went the other day to
Scarlet's to buy green spectacles; he was mighty assiduous to
give me a pair that would not tumble my hair. "Lord! Sir,"  said
I, "when one is come to wear spectacles, what signifies  how one
looks?"

I hope soon to add another volume to your packet from my
press.  I shall now only print for presents; or to talk in a
higher style, I shall only give my Louvre editions to
privy-councillors and foreign ministers.  Apropos! there is a
book of this sacred sort which I wish I could by your means
procure: it is the account, with plates, of what has been  found
at Herculaneum.  You may promise the King of Naples in  return
all my editions.  Adieu! my dear Sir.

Sept. 4.

I had sealed this up, and was just sending it to London, when  I
received yours of the 13th of this month.  I am charmed with  the
success of your campaign at Leghorn-a few such generals or
ministers would give a revulsion to our affairs.

You frighten me with telling me of innumerable copies taken of
my inscription on the Pope's picture: some of our bear-leaders
will pick it up, send it over, and I shall have the horror of
seeing it in a magazine.  Though I had no scruple of sending  the
good old man a cordial, I should hate to have it published  at
the tail of a newspaper, like a testimonial from one of Dr.
Rock's patients!  You talk of the Pope's enemies; who are  they?
I thought at most he could have none but at our
bonfires on the fifth of November.

395 Letter 238
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 8, 1757.

How I laughed at your picture of the shrine of Notre Dame de
Straberri, and of the vows hung up there! I little thought  that
when I converted my castle into a printing office, the  next
transformation Would be into an hospital for the "filles
repenties" from Mrs. Naylor's and Lady Fitzroy's.(826)  You  will
treat the enclosed I trust with a little more respect;  not for
the sake of the hero, but of the poet.  The poet, poor  soul! has
had a relapse, but is again recovering.  As I know  no earthly
history, you must accept the sonnet as if it was  written into my
letter; and therefore supposing this the end  of the third page,
I bid you good night.

396 Letter 239
To The Right Hon. Lady Hervey.(827)
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 13, 1757.

Madam,
After all the trouble your ladyship has been so good as to  take
voluntarily, you will think it a little hard that I
should presume to give you more; but it is a cause, Madam, in
which I know you feel, and I can suggest new motives to your
ladyship's zeal.  In short, Madam, I am on the crisis of
losing Mademoiselle de l'Enclos's picture, or of getting both
that and her letters to Lady Sandwich.  I enclose Lord
Sandwich's letter to me, which will explain the whole.  Madame
Greffini, I suppose, is Madame Graphigny;(828) whom some of  your
ladyship's friends, if not yourself, must know; and she  might be
of use, if she could be trusted not to detain so  tempting a
treasure as the letters.  From the effects being  sealed up, I
have still hopes; greater, from the goodness your  ladyship had
in writing before.  Don't wonder, Madam, at my  eagerness:
besides a good quantity Of natural impatience, I am  now
interested as an editor and printer.  Think what pride it  would
give me to print original letters of Ninon at Strawberry  Hill!
If your ladyship knows any farther means of serving me,  of
serving yourself, good Mr. Welldone, as the widow Lackit  says in
Oroonoko, I need not doubt your employing them.  Your  ladyship
and I are of a religion, with regard to certain
saints, that inspires more zeal than such trifling temptations
as persecution and fagots infuse into bigots of other sects.   I
think a cause like ours might communicate ardour even to my  Lady
Stafford.  If she will assist in recovering, Notre Dame  des
Amours, I will add St. Raoul(829) to my calendar.  I am  hers and
your ladyship's most obedient and faithful humble  servant.

(827) Lady Hervey was only daughter of Brigadier-General
Nicholas Lepel.  She was maid of honour to Queen Caroline, and

Bristol, by whom she had four sons and four daughters.  She  died

396 Letter 240
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Sept. 20(830)

My dear Sir,
I have been roving about Hampshire with Mr. Chute, and did not
receive your very kind note till yesterday, or I should
certainly not have deferred a moment to thank you for it, and
to express my great concern for Miss Montagu's bad health.   You
do me justice when you reckon on my feeling most sincerely  for
you: but let me ask why you will not bring her to town?  She
might not only have more variety of assistance, but it  would be
some relief to you: it must be dreadful, with your  tenderness
and feeling, to have nobody to share and divert  your uneasiness.

I did not, till on the road the day before yesterday, hear the
catastrophe of poor Sir John Bland, and the execrable villany,
or, what our ancestors would have called, the humours of
Taaffe.  I am extremely sorry for Bland! He was very
good-natured, and generous and well-bred; but never was such
infatuation - I can call it by no term but flirting away his
fortune and his life; he seemed to have no passion for play
while he did it, nor sensibility when it ruined him but I fear
he had both! What judgments the good people in the city (I  mean
the good in their own style, moneyed) will construe upon
White's, when two of the most remarkable members have
despatched themselves in nine months!

I shall be most sincerely glad to receive another letter to
tell me that Miss Montagu mends: you have both my most hearty
wishes.  Yours ever.

(830) This letter is misplaced: the date of the year is
1755.-E.



397 Letter 241
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 29, 1757.

For how many years have I been telling you that your country
was mad, that your country was undone! It does not grow wiser;
it does not grow more prosperous!  You can scarce have
recovered your astonishment at the suspension of arms(831)
concluded near Stade.  How do you behave on these lamentable
occasions?  Oh! believe me, it is comfortable to have an
island to hide one's head in! You will be more surprised when
you hear that it is totally disavowed here.  The clamour is
going to be extreme--no wonder, when Kensington is the
headquarters of murmur.  The commander-in-chief is recalled--
the late Elector(832) is outrageous.  On such an occasion you
may imagine that every old store of malice and hatred is
ransacked: but you would not think that the general is now
accused of cowardice! As improbable as that is, I do not know
whether it may not grow your duty as a minister to believe
it-and if it does, you must be sure not to believe, that with
all this tempest the suspension was dictated from hence.  Be
that as it may, the general is to be the sacrifice.  The
difficulty will be extreme with regard to the Hessians, for
they are in English pay.  The King of Prussia will be another
victim: he says we have undone him, without mending our own
situation.  He expected to beat the Prince de Soubize by
surprise, but he, like the Austrians, declined a battle, and
now will be reinforced by Richelieu's army, who is doomed to  be
a hero by our absurdities.  Austrians, French, Russians,  Swedes,
can the King of Prussia not sink under all these!
This suspension has made our secret expedition forgot by all
but us who feel for particulars.  It is the fashion now to
believe it is not against the coast of France; I wish I could
believe so!

As if all these disgraces were foreign objects not worth
attending to, we have a civil war at home; literally so in  many
counties.  The wise Lords, to defeat it, have made the
Militia-bill so preposterous that it has raised a rebellion.
George Townshend, the promoter of it for popularity, sees it  not
only most unpopular in his own county, but his father, my  Lord
Townshend, who is not the least mad of your countrymen,  attended
by a parson, a barber, and his own servants, and in  his own long
hair, which he has let grow, raised a mob against  the execution
of the bill, and has written a paper against it,  which he has
pasted up on the doors of four churches near him.   It is a good
name that a Dr. Stevens has given to our present  situation, (for
one cannot call it a Government,) a Mobocracy.
I come to your letters which are much more agreeable subjects.
I think I must not wish you joy of the termination of the
Lorrain reign, you have lately taken to them, but I
congratulate the Tuscans.  Thank you extremely for the trouble
you have given yourself in translating my inscription, and for
the Pope's letter: I am charmed with his beautiful humility,  and
his delightful way of expressing it.  For his ignorance  about my
father, I impute it to some failure of his memory.  I  should
like to tell him that were my father still minister, I  trust we
should not make the figure we do--at least he and  England fell
together! If it is ignorance, Mr. Chute says it  is a
confirmation of the Pope's deserving the inscription, as  he
troubles his head so little about disturbing the peace of
others.  But our enemies need not disturb us-we do their
business ourselves.  I have one, and that not a little
comfort, in my politics ; this suspension will at least
prevent further hostilities between us and the Empress-Queen,
and that secures my dear you.

When I have done thinking of politics, and that is always in  an
instant, unless such as you and Mr. Conway are involved in  them,
I am far from passing my time disagreeably.  My mind is  of no
gloomy turn, and I have a thousand ways of amusing
myself.  Indeed of late I have been terribly frightened lest I
must give them all up; my fears have gone to extravagance; do
not wonder; my life is not quite irrational, and I trembled to
think that I was growing fit only to consort with dowagers.
What an exchange, books and drawings, and every thing of that
sort, for cards!  In short, for ten weeks I have had such  pains
in my eyes with the least application, that I thought I  should
lose them, at least that they would be useless.  I was  told that
with reading and writing at night I had strained and  relaxed the
nerves.  However, I am convinced that though this  is partly the
case, the immediate uneasiness came from a cold,  which I caught
in the hot weather by giving myself Florentine  airs, by lying
with my windows open, and by lying on the
ground without my waistcoat.  After trying forty 'you should  do
this's,'(833) Mr. Chute has cured me -with a very simple
medicine: I will tell it you, that you may talk to Dr. Cocchi
and about my eyes too.  It is to bathe and rub the outsides  all
round, especially on the temples, with half a teaspoonful  of
white spirit of lavender (not lavender-water) and half of
Hungary-water.  I do this night and morning, and sometimes in
the day: in ten days it has taken off all the uneasiness; I  can
now read in a chaise, which I had totally lost, and for  five or
six hours by candle-light, without spectacles or
candle-screen.  In short, the difference is incredible.
Observe that they watered but little, and were less inflamed;
only a few veins appeared red, whereas my eyes were remarkably
clear.  I do not know whether this would do with any humour,  but
that I never had.  It is certain that a young man who for  above
twelve years had studied the law by being read to, from  vast
relaxation of the nerves, totally recovered the use of  his eyes.
I should think I tired you with this detail, if I  was not sure
that you cannot be tired with learning any thing  for the good of
others.  As the medicine is so hot, it must  not be let into the
eyes, nor I should think be continued too  long.

I approve much of your letter to Mr. Fox; I will give it to  him
at his return, but at present he is on a tour.  How
scrupulous you are in giving yourself the trouble to send me a
copy--was that needful? or are you not always full of
attentions that speak kindness?  Your brother will take care  to
procure the vases when they come, and is inquiring for the
liqueurs.

I am putting up a stone in St. Ann's churchyard for your old
friend King Theodore; in short, his history is too remarkable  to
be let perish.  Mr. Bentley says that I am not only an
antiquarian, but prepare materials for future antiquarians.   You
will laugh to hear that when I sent the inscription to the
vestry for the approbation of the ministers and churchwardens,
they demurred, and took some days to consider whether they
should suffer him to be called King of Corsica.  Happily they
have acknowledged his title! Here is the inscription; over it  is
a crown exactly copied from his coin:

"Near this place is interred
Theodore King of Corsica,
Who died in this perish Dec. 11, 1756,
Immediately after leaving the King's-Bench Prison,
By the benefit of the Act of Insolvency.
In consequence of which he registered
His Kingdom of Corsica
For the use of his Creditors.
The Grave, great teacher, to a level brings
heroes and beggars, galley-slaves and kings.
But Theodore this lesson learn'd, ere dead;
Fate pour'd its lessons on his living head,
Bestow'd a kingdom and denied him bread.

I think that at least it cannot be said of me, as it was of  the
Duke of Buckingham entombing Dryden,

"And help'd to bury whom he help'd to starve."

I would have served him, if a King, even in a gaol, could he
have been an honest man.  Our papers say, that we are bustling
about Corsica; I wish if we throw away our own liberty, that  we
may at least help others to theirs!  Adieu! my dear Sir.

 400 Letter 242
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(834)
Arlington Street, Saturday, Oct. 8, 1757.

My dearest Harry,
But one person in the world may pretend to be so much
overjoyed as I am at your return.(835)  I came hither to-day,
on purpose to learn about you; but how can you ask me such a
question, as do I think you are come too safe?  is this a time
of day to question your spirit?  I know but two things on
earth I esteem more, your goodness and your sense.  You cannot
come into dispute; but by what I have picked up at my Lady
Townshend's, I find there is a scheme of distinguishing
between the land and the sea.  The King has been told, that
Sir Edward Hawke had written, that, after waiting two days, he
asked the officers how long it would be before they took a
resolution; That if they would not attack, he should carry the
fleet home.(836)  I should not entirely credit this report, if
Mr. Keith, who was present, had not dropped, in a dry way,
that some distinction would be shown to Captain Howe and
Captain Greaves.  What confirms my opinion is, that I have
never received the letter you say you sent me by the last
express.  I suppose it is detained, till proper emissaries
have made proper impressions; but we will not let it pass so.
If you had not bid me, I should not have given you this
intelligence, for your character is too sacred to be trifled
with; and as you are invulnerable by any slanders, it is
proper you should know immediately even what may be meditated.

The Duke is expected every hour.  As he must not defend
himself, his case will be harder than yours.  I was to go to
Bath on Monday, but will certainly not go without seeing you:
let me know your motions, and I will meet you any where.  As I
know your scrupulousness about saying any thing I say to you
privately, I think it necessary. to tell you, that I don't
mean to preclude you from communicating any part of this
letter to those with whom it may be proper for you to consult;
only don't let more weight be given to my intelligence than it
deserves.  I have told you exactly where and what I heard.  It
may not prove so, but there is no harm in being prepared.

(834) Now first printed.

(835) From the Expedition to Rochfort.  The expedition, under
Sir Edward Hawke, sailed early in September, and, on the 28th,
attacked the Isle of Aix; after which it returned to Spithead,
without attempting to land the troops.-E.

(836) On the 22d, Mr. Beckford writes to Mr. Pitt. "I hear
that Admiral Hawke says, the land-general has acted in a very
unbecoming manner, and will declare his sentiments to
Parliament.  I hope he will: that, if possible, the mystery
may be unravelled.  I have often lamented the fatality
attending conjunct commands.  The French avoid them in all
their expeditions; for rank is perfectly settled among the
land and sea officers, and the eldest commission carries the
command."  Chatham Correspondence, vol. i. p. 279.-E.



401 Letter 243
To The Earl Of Strafford.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 11, 1757.

My dear lord,
You will have seen or heard that the fleet is returned.  They
have brought home nothing but one little island, which is a
great deal more than I expected, having neither thought so
despicably of France, or so considerably of ourselves, as to
believe they were exposed to much damage.  My joy for Mr.
Conway's return is not at all lessened by the clamour on this
disappointment.  Had he been chief commander, I should be very
sure the nothing he had done was all he could do.  As he was
under orders, I wait with patience to hear his general's
vindication.

I hope the Yorkists have not knocked out your brains for
living in a county.  In my neighbourhood they have insulted
the Parliament in person.(837)  He called in the Blues,
instead of piquing himself on dying in his curule chair in the
stable-yard at Ember-court.  So entirely have we lost our
spirit, that the standing army is forced to defend us against
the people, when we endeavour to give them a militia, to save
them from a standing army; and that the representative of the
Parliament had rather owe his life to the Guards than die in
the cause of a militia.  Sure Lenthall's ghost will come and
pull him by the nose!

I hope you begin to cast a southward look, and that my lady's
chickens and ducklings are old enough to go to a day-school,
and will not want her any longer.

My Lord Townshend and George are engaged in a paper-war
against one another, about the militia.  That bill, the
suspension at Stade, and the late expedition, which has cost
millions, will find us in amusements this winter.  It is
lucky, for I despair of the Opera.  The Mattei has sent
certificates to prove that she is stopped by an inundation.
The certificates I suppose can swim.  Adieu, my dear lord!

(837) Mr. Onslow, the Speaker.



402 Letter 244
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 12, 1757.

I shall Write you but a short letter for more reasons than
one--there are you blushing again for your country! We have
often behaved extravagantly, and often shamefully-this time we
have united both.  I think I will not read a newspaper this
month, till the French have vented all their mirth.  If I had
told You two months ago that this magnificent expedition was
designed against Rochfort, would you have believed me? Yet we
are strangely angry that we have not taken it! The clamour
against Sir John Mordaunt is at high-water-mark, but as I was
the dupe of clamour last year against one of the bravest of
men,(838) I shall suspend my belief till all is explained.
Explained it will be somehow or other: it seems to me that we
do nothing but expose ourselves in summer, in order to furnish
inquiries for the winter; and then those inquiries expose us
again.  My great satisfaction is, that Mr. Conway is not only
returned safe, but that all the world agrees that it is not
his fault that he is SO.  He is still at Portsmouth to see the
troops disembark.  Hawke is come, and was graciously
received.--poor Sir John Mordaunt, who was sent for, was
received -as ill.  I tell you no particulars of their
campaign, for I know it slightly, and will wait till I know it
exactly.

The Duke came last night.  You will not hear much more of his
affair: he will not do himself justice, and it proves too
gross, to be possible to do him injustice.

I think all the comfort we extract from a thousand bitter
herbs, is, that the Russians are gone back, gone
precipitately, and as yet we don't know why.

I have received yours of the 17th of last month, and you may
quiet your fears about posts: we have received all that each
has written, except my last, which could not be arrived at
Florence when yours came away.  Mine was of the 29th of last
month, and had many particulars; I hope not too many to stop
its journey!

To add to the ill-humour, our papers are filled with the new
loss of Fort William-Henry, which covered New York.  That
opulent and proud colony between their own factions and our
folly is in imminent danger; but I will have done--nay, if we
lose another dominion.  I think I will have done writing to
you, I cannot bear to chronicle so many disgraces.  Adieu!

(838) Admiral Byng.



403 Letter 245
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 13, 1757.

If you have received mine of Tuesday, which I directed to
Portsmouth, you will perceive how much I agree with you.  I am
charmed with your sensible modesty.  When I talked to you of
defence, it was from concluding that you had all agreed that
the attempt(839) was impracticable, nay, impossible; and from
thence I judged that the ministry intended to cast the blame
of a wild project upon the officers.  That they may be a
little willing to do that, I still think-but I have the joy to
find that it cannot be thrown on you.  As your friend, and
fearing, if I talked for you first, it would look like doubt
of your behaviour, at least that you had bid me defend you at
the expense of your friends, I said not a word, trusting that
your innocence would break out and make its way.  I have the
satisfaction to find it has already done so.  It comes from
all quarters but your own, which makes it more honourable.  My
Lady Suffolk told me last night, that she heard all the seamen
said they wished the general had been as ready as Mr. Conway.
But this is not all: I left a positive commission in town to
have the truth of the general report sent me without the least
disguise: in consequence of which I am solemnly assured that
your name is never mentioned but with honour; that all the
violence, and that extreme, is against Sir John Mordaunt and
Mr. Cornwallis.  I am particularly sorry for the latter, as I
firmly believe him as brave as possible.

This situation of things makes me advise, what I know and find
I need not advise, your saying as little as possible in your
own defence, nay, as much as you can with any decency for the
others.  I am neither acquainted with, nor care a straw about,
Sir John Mordaunt; but as it is known that you differed with
him, it will do you the greatest honour to vindicate him,
instead of disculpating yourself.  My most earnest desire
always is, to have your character continue as amiable and
respectable as possible.  There is no doubt but the whole will
come out, and therefore your justification not coming from
yourself will set it in a ten times better light.  I shall go
to town to-day to meet your brother; and as I know his
affection for you will make him warm in clearing you, I shall
endeavour to restrain that ardour, of which you know I have
enough on the least glimmering of a necessity: but I am sure
you will agree with me, that, on the representation I have
here made to you, it is not proper for your friends to appear
solicitous about you.

The city talk very treason, and, connecting the suspension at
Stade with this disappointment,(840) cry out, that the general
had positive orders to do nothing, in order to obtain gentler
treatment of Hanover.  They intend in a violent manner to
demand redress, and are too enraged to let any part of this
affair remain a mystery.

I think, by your directions, this will reach you before you
leave Bevismount: I would gladly meet you at Park-place, if i
was not sure of seeing you in town a day or two afterwards at
farthest; which I will certainly do, if you let me know.
Adieu!

(839) On Rochfort.

(840) "In all these complicated machines," writes Lord
Chesterfield to his son, on the 4th of this month, "there are
so many wheels within wheels, that it is always difficult and
sometimes impossible, to guess which of them gives direction
to the whole.  Mr. Pitt is convinced that the principal wheel,
or if you will, spoke in the wheel, came from Stade."-E.



404 Letter 246
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Oct 18, 1757.

You never begged news at a worse time; for though I should
tell you much, I have neither time nor inclination, This
sounds brusque, but I will explain it.  With regard to the
expedition, I am so far easy about Mr. Conway that he will
appear with great honour, but it is not pleasant to hear him
complicated with others in the mean time.  He cannot speak
till forced.  In short, there are twenty delicacies not for a
letter.  The big event is, the Duke's resignation.  He is not
so patient as Mr. Conway under unmerited reproach, and has
thrown up every thing, regiment and all.  You and I wish for a
Fronde, but I don't expect one.  At worst it will produce
M`emoires de la Fronde.  I rejoice that all your family is
well, and beg my compliments to them.  For this time you must
excuse a very short letter; I am only in town for this evening
to meet Mr. Conway, and I snatch a moment, that you might not
think me neglectful of you, which I certainly never will be.
Adieu!



404 Letter 247
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Oct. 24, 1757.

It is impossible not to write to you upon the great event(841)
that has happened, and yet it is difficult to know how to
write upon it.  Considering your situation, it is improper to
make harsh comments: Europe, I suppose, will not be so
delicate.  Our ministers have kept the article out of our own
papers; but they have as little power over foreign gazettes,
as weight with foreign powers.  In short, the Duke is arrived,
was very ill received, and without that, would have done, what
he did immediately, resign all his commissions.  He does not,
like his brother,(842) go into opposition.  He is even to make
his Usual appearances.  He treated Munchausen,(843) who had
taken great liberties with his name, with proper severity--I
measure my words extremely, not for my own sake, but yours.

General Mordaunt has demanded an inquiry.  The form is not
settled yet; nor can it be soon, as Sir Edward Hawke is gone
upon a cruise with the fleet.  I put a quick end to this
letter; I have no more facts to tell you; reflections you will
make yourself.  In the uncertainty of this reaching you, it is
better to say no more.  Adieu!

(841) The Duke of Cumberland's resignation of the command of
the army.

(842) Frederick Prince of wales.

(843) The minister for Hanover.



405 Letter 248
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 20, 1757.

I do not like to find that our correspondence is certainly
deranged.  I have received but one letter from you for a great
while; it is of October 8th, and complaining on your side too.
You say my last was Sept. 3d.  Since that I wrote on the 29th,
on the 13th, and 24th of last month.  I have omitted a month,
waiting to see if you got my letters, and to have something
decisive to tell you.  Neither has happened, and yet I know
you will be unhappy not to hear from me, which makes me write
now.  Our Parliament was suddenly put off to the first of next
month), on news that the King Of Prussia had made a separate
peace with France;- as the Speech was prepared to ask money
for him, it was necessary to set it to a new tune; but we have
been agreeably surprised with his gaining a great victory over
the Prince de Soubize;(844) but of this we have only the first
imperfect account, the wind detaining his courier or
aide-de-camp on the other side still.  It is prodigious how we
want all the good news we can amass together! Our fleet
dispersed by a tempest in America, where, into the bargain, we
had done nothing, the uneasiness on the convention at Stade,
which, by this time, I believe we have broken, and on the
disappointment about Rochfort, added to the wretched state of
our internal affairs; all this has reduced us to a most
contemptible figure.  The people are dissatisfied, mutinous,
and ripe for insurrections, which indeed have already appeared
on the militia and on the dearness of corn, which is believed
to be owing to much villany in the dealers.  But the other day
I saw a strange sight, a man crying corn, "Do you want any
corn?" as they cry knives and scissors.  To add to the
confusion, the troubles in Ireland, which Mr. Conway had
pacified, are broke out afresh, by the imprudence of the Duke
of Bedford and the ambition of the primate.(845)  The latter
had offered himself to the former, who rejected him, meaning
to balance the parties, but was insensibly hurried into Lord
Kildare's,(846) to please mr. Fox.  The primate's faction have
passed eleven resolutions on pensions and grievances, equal to
any in 1641, and the Duke of Bedford's friends dared not say a
word against them.(847)  The day before yesterday a messenger
arrived from him for help; the council will try to mollify;
but Ireland is no tractable country.  About what you will be
more inquisitive, is the disappointment at Rochfort, and its
consequences.  Sir John Mordaunt demanded an inquiry which the
city was going to demand.  The Duke of Marlborough, Lord
George Sackville, and General Waldegrave have held a public
inquest, with the fairness of which people are satisfied; the
report is not to be made to the King till to-morrow, for which
I shall reserve my letter.  You may easily imagine, that with
all my satisfaction in Mr. Conway's behaviour, I am very
unhappy about him: he is more so; having guarded and gained
the most perfect character in the world by the severest
attention to it, you may guess what he feels under any thing
that looks like a trial.  You will see him more like himself,
in a story his aide-de-camp, Captain Hamilton,(848) tells of
him.  While they were on the isle of Aix, Mr. Conway was so
careless and so fearless as to be trying a burning-glass on a
bomb--yes, a bomb, the match of which had been cut short to
prevent its being fired by any accidental sparks of tobacco.
Hamilton snatched the glass out of Mr. Conway's hand before he
had at all thought what he was about.  I can tell you another
story of him, that describes all his thought for others, while
so indifferent about himself.  Being with my Lady Ailesbury in
his absence, I missed a favourite groom they used to have; she
told me this story.  The fellow refused to accompany Mr.
Conway on the expedition, unless he would provide for his
widow in case of accidents.  Mr. C., who had just made his
will and settled his affairs, replied coolly, "I have provided
for her."  The man, instead of being struck, had the command
of himself to ask how?  He was told, she would have two
hundred pounds.  Still uncharmed, he said it was too little!
Mr. Conway replied he was sorry he was not content; he could
do no more; but would only desire him to go to Portsmouth and
see his horses embarked.  He refused.  If such goodness would
make one adore human nature, such ingratitude would soon cure
one!

Mr. Fox was going to write to you, but I took all the
compliments upon myself, as I think it is better for you to be
on easy than ceremonious terms.  To promote this, I have
established a correspondence between you; he will be glad if
you will send him two chests of the best Florence wine every
year.  The perpetuity destroys all possibility of your making
him presents Of it.  I have compounded for the vases, but he
would not hear, nor must you think of giving him the wine,
which you must transact with your brother and me.  The best of
Florence which puzzled James and me so much, proves to be Lord
Hertford's drams.  We have got something else from Florence,
not your brother James and I, but the public: here is arrived
a Countess Rena, of whom my Lord Pembroke bought such
quantities of Florence, etc.  I shall wonder if he deals with
her any more, as he has the sweetest wife(849) in the world,
and it seems to be some time since La Comtessa was so.  Tell
me more of her history; antique as she is, she is since my
time.. Alas! every thing makes me think myself old since I
have worn out my eyes, which, notwithstanding the cure I
thought Mr. Chute had made upon them, are of very little use
to me.  You have no notion how it mortifies me: when I am
wishing to withdraw more and more from a world of which I have
had satiety, and which I suppose is as tired of me, how
vexatious not to be able to indulge a happiness that depends
only on oneself, and consequently the only happiness proper
for people past their youth! I have often deluded you with
promises of returning to Florence for pleasure, I now threaten
you with it for your plague; for if I am to become a tiresome
old fool, at least it shall not be in my own country.  In the
mean time, I must give you a commission for my press.  I have
printed one book, (of which two copies are ready for you and
Dr. Cocchi,) and I have written another - it is a Catalogue of
the Royal and Noble Authors of England.  Richard 1. it seems
was, or had a mind to pass for, a Proven`cal poet; nay, some
of those compositions are extant, and you must procure them
for me: Crescimbeni says there are some in the library of San
Lorenza at Florence, in uno de' Codici Provenzali, and others
nel 3204 della Vaticana.(850)  YOU Will oblige and serve me
highly if you can get me copies.  Dr. Cocchi certainly knows
Crescimbeni's Commentary on the Lives of the Proven`cal
Poets.(851)

I shall wind up this letter, Which is pretty long for a blind
man without spectacles, with an admirable bon-mot.  Somebody
asked me at the play the other night what was become of Mrs.
Woffington; I replied, she is taken off by Colonel Caesar.
Lord Tyrawley said, "I suppose she was reduced to aut Caesar
aut Nullus."

The monument about which you ask you shall see in a drawing,
when finished; it is a simple Gothic arch, something in the
manner of the columbaria: a Gothic columbarium is a new
thought of my own, of which I am fond, and going(852) to
execute one at Strawberry.  That at Linton is to have a
beautiful urn, designed by Mr. Bentley, as the whole is, with
this plain, very true inscription, "Galfrido Mann, amicissimo,
optimo, qui obiit--H. W. P."

Thank you for the King of Prussia's letter, though I had seen
it before.  It is lively and odd.  He seems to write as well
with Voltaire as he fights as well without the French--or
without us.

Monday night.

The report is made, but I have not yet seen it, and this
letter must go away this minute.  I hear it names no names,
says no reason appears why they did not land on the 25th, and
gives no merit to all Mr. Conway's subsequent proposals for
landing.  Adieu!

To George Montagu, Esq.
Dec. 23, 1757.

You, who have always cultivated rather than stifled tender
sensations, well know how to feel for me, who have at last
lost my dear friend, Mr. Mann, not unexpectedly certainly; but
I never could find that one grew indifferent to what pains, as
one does to what pleases one.  With all my consciousness of
having been more obliged to your brother than I could possibly
deserve, I think I should have trespassed on his kindness, and
have asked him to continue his favours to Mr. Mann's son and
brother, if I had not known that he was good beyond doubt: it
is just necessary for me, as transferring my friendship to the
family, to tell you, that if the contrary should be
insinuated, they do continue the business.

Had I any thing to tell you, it would be unpardonable in me to
communicate my grief to you and neglect your entertainment,
but Mr. Pitt's gout has laid up the nation; we adjourn
to-morrow for the holidays, and have not had a single
division.  Mr. Pitt, Mr. Fox, France, and the King of Prussia
will not leave us idle much longer.  Adieu!  I am most
unaffectedly grieved, and most unfeignedly yours.

Sir,
The Dean of Exeter(854) having showed me a letter in which you
desire the name of the MS. which contains the illumination I
wished to see, I take the liberty of troubling you with this.
The book is called "The Dictes and Sayings of the
Philosophers: translated out of Latyn into Frenshe, by Messire
Jehan de Jeonville; and from thence rendered into English, by
Earl Rivers."(855)--I am perfectly ashamed, Sir, of giving you
so much trouble, but your extreme civility and good-nature,
and your great disposition to assist in any thing that relates
to literature, encouraged me to make my application to you;
and the politeness with which you received it I shall always
acknowledge with the greatest gratitude.  The Dean desired me
to make his excuses to you for not writing himself; and my
Lord Lyttelton returns you a thousand thanks for your kind
offers of communication, and proposes to wait on you himself
and talk those matters over with you.  I shall not fail of
paying my respects to you on Friday next, at one o'clock; and
am, Sir, yours, etc.

of the Society of Antiquaries.  The Doctor was a strenuous

introducing Caxton to Edward the Fourth, his Queen, and the

who omitted to translate part of it, because it contained
sarcasms of Socrates against the fair sex."-E.



410 Letter 252
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Jan, 11, 1758.

You express so much concern and tenderness for Mr. Conway and
me in your letter of Dec. 17th, which I received two days ago,
that I am impatient and happy to tell you, that after keeping
the report of the court-martial a week, the King yesterday
approved the sentence, which is a full acquittal of Sir John
Mordaunt, and was unanimous.  If the commander-in-chief is so
fully cleared, what must the subordinate generals be? There
are still flying whispers of its being brought into Parliament
in some shape or other, but every public and private reason, I
say reason, forbid it.  Sure this is not a season to relume
heats, when tranquility is so essential and so established!
In a private light who can wish to raise such a cloud of
enemies as the whole army, who murmur grievously at hearing
that an acquittal is not an acquittal; who hold it tyranny, if
they are not to be as safe by their juries as the rest of
their fellow-subjects; and who think a judgment of twenty-one
general officers not to be trifled with.  I tremble if any
rashness drives the army to distinguish or think themselves
distinguished from the civil government.

You are by this time, I suppose, in weepers for princess
Caroline;(856) though her state of health has been so
dangerous for years, and her absolute confinement for many of
them, her disorder was in a manner new and sudden, and her
death unexpected by herself, though earnestly her wish.  her
goodness was constant and uniform, her generosity immense, her
charities most extensive--in short I, no royalist, could be
lavish in her praise.  What will divert you is, that the Duke
of Norfolk's and Lord Northumberland's upper servants have
asked leave to put themselves in mourning, not out of regard
for this admirable Princess, but to be more sur le bon ton.  I
told the Duchess I supposed they would expect her to mourn
hereafter for their relations.

Well, it seems I guessed better about Sir James Grey than he
knew about himself.  Sir Benjamin Keene is dead;(857) I dined
to-day where Colonel Grey did; he told me it is a year and a
half since the King named his brother for Spain, and that he
himself was told but yesterday that Sir James was too well at
Naples to be removed,(858) and that reasons of state called
for somebody else.  Would they called for you! and why not?
You are attached to nobody; your dear brother had as much
reason to flatter himself with Mr. Pitt's favour, as he was
marked by not having Mr. Fox's.  Your not having the least
connexion with the latter cannot hurt you.  Such a change, for
so great an object, would overrule all my prudence: but I do
not know whether it were safe, to hint it'. especially as by
this time, at least before your application could come, it
must be disposed of.  Lord Rochfort wishes it, Lord Huntingdon
has asked it; Lord Tyrawley and Lord Bristol(859) are talked
of.  I am so afraid of ticklish situations for you, that in
case of the latter's removal, I should scarce wish you Turin.
I cannot quit this chapter without lamenting Keene! my father
had the highest opinion of his abilities, and indeed his late
Negotiations have been crowned with proportionate success.  He
had great wit, agreeableness, and an indolent good-humour that
was very pleasing: he loved our dearest Gal.!

The King of Prussia is quite idle; I think he has done nothing
this fortnight but take Breslau, and Schweidnitz, and ten or a
dozen generals, and from thirty to fifty thousand prisoners--
in this respect he contradicts the omne majus continet in se
minus.  I trust he is galloping somewhere or other with only a
groom to get a victory.  Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick has
galloped a little from one: when we were expecting that he
would drive the French army into the sea, and were preparing
to go to Harwich to see it, he turned back, as if he wanted to
speak with the King of Prussia.  In a street very near me they
do not care to own this; but as my side of Arlington Street is
not ministerial, we plain-dealing houses speak our mind about
it.  Pray, do not you about that or any thing else; remember
you are an envoy, and though you must not presume to be as
false as an ambassador, yet not a grain of truth is consistent
with your character.  Truth is very well for such simple
people as me, with my Fari quae sentiat, which my father left
me, and which I value more than all he left me; but I am
errantly wicked enough to desire you should lie and prosper.
I know you don't like my doctrine, and therefore I compound
with you for holding your tongue.  Adieu! my dear child--shall
we never meet! Are we always to love one another at the
discretion of a sheet of paper? I would tell you in another
manner that I am ever yours.

P. S. I will not plague you with more than a postscript on my
eyes: I write this after midnight quite at my ease; I think
the greatest benefit I have found lies between old rum and
elder-water, (three spoonfuls of the latter to one of the
former,) and dipping my head in a pail of cold water every
morning the moment I am out of bed.  This I am told may affect
my hearing, but I have too constant a passion for my eyes to
throw away a thought on any rival.

(858) Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, in a letter to her daughter,
dated Venice, April 3, says, "Sir James Grey was universally
esteemed during his residence here: but, alas! he is gone to
Naples.  I wish the maxims of Queen Elizabeth were revived,
who always chose men whose birth or behaviour would make the
nation respected, people being apt to look upon them as a
sample of their countrymen.  If those now employed are so--
Lord have mercy upon us! How much the nation has suffered by
false intelligence, I believe you are very sensible of; and
how impossible it is to obtain truth either from a fool or a

411 Letter 253
To Dr. Ducarel.
Arlington Street, January 12, 1758.

I have the pleasure to let you know, that his grace the
Archbishop(860) has, with the greatest politeness and
goodness, sent me word, by the dean of Exeter, that he gives
me leave to have the illumination copied, on a receipt either
at your chambers, or at my own house, giving you a receipt for
it.  As the former would be so inconvenient to me as to render
this favour useless, I have accepted the latter with great
joy; and will send a gentleman of the exchequer, my own
deputy, to you, Sir@ on Monday next, with my receipt, and
shall beg the favour of you to deliver the MS. to him, Mr.
Bedford.  I would wait On you myself, but have caught cold at
the visit I made you yesterday, and am besides going to
Strawberry Hill, from whence I propose to bring you a little
print, which was never sold, and not to be had from any body
else; which is, the arms of the two Clubs at Arthur's;(861) a
print exceedingly in request last year.  When I have more
leisure, for at this time of the year I am much hurried, I
shall be able, I believe, to pick you out some other
curiosities; and am, Sir, etc.

(860) Dr. Matthew Hutton. He died in the following April, and
was succeeded in the archbishopric by Dr. Secker.

(861) Designed by Mr. Walpole's friend, Lord Edgecumbe, and
engraved by Grinion.



412 Letter 254
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 9, 1758.

One would not have believed that I could so long have wanted
something to form a letter; but I think politics are gone into
winter-quarters: Mr. Pitt is in bed with the gout, and the
King of Prussia writing sonnets to Voltaire; but his Majesty's
lyre is not half so charming as his sword: if he does not take
care, Alexander will ride home upon his verses.  All England
has kept his birthday; it has taken its place in our calendar
next to Admiral Vernon's(862) and my Lord Blakeney's; and the
people, I believe, begin to think that Prussia is some part
of' Old England.  We had bonfires and processions,
illuminations and French horns playing out of windows all
night.

In the mean time there have been some distant grumblings of a
war with Spain, which seem blown over: a new Russian army in
March has taken its place.  The Duke of Richelieu is said to
be banished for appropriating some contributions(863) to his
own use: if he does not take care to prove that he meant to
make as extravagant a use of them as ever Marquis Catiline
did, it will be a very bourgeoise termination of such a
gallant life!  By the rage of expense in our pleasures, in the
midst of such dearness and distress, one would think we had
opportunities of contributions too!  The simple Duke of St.
Albans,(864) who is retired to Brussels for debt, has made a
most sumptuous funeral in public for a dab of five months old
that he had by his cookmaid.  But our glaring extravagance is
the CONSTANT high price given for pictures: the other day at
Mr. Furnese's(865) auction a very small Gaspar sold for
seventy-six guineas; and a Carlo Maratti, which too I am
persuaded was a Giuseppe Chiari, lord Egremont bought at the
rate of two hundred and sixty pounds.  Mr. Spencer(866) gave
no less than two thousand two hundred pounds for the Andrea
Sacchi and the Guido from the same collection.  The latter is
of very dubious originality: my father, I think, preferred the
Andrea Sacchi to his own Guido, and once offered seven hundred
pounds for it, but Furnese said, "Damn him, it is for him; he
shall pay a thousand."  There is a pewterer, one Cleeve, who
some time ago gave one thousand pounds for four very small
Dutch pictures.  I know- but one dear picture not sold,
Cooper's head of Oliver Cromwell, an unfinished miniature;
they asked me four hundred pounds for it!  But pictures do not
monopolize extravagance; I have seen a little ugly shell
called a Ventle-trap sold for twenty-seven guineas.  However,
to do us justice, we have magnificence too that is well
judged.  The Palmyra and Balbec are noble works to be
undertaken and executed by private men.(867)  There is now
established a Society for the encouragement of Arts, Sciences,
and Commerce, that is likely to be very serviceable;(868) and
I  was pleased yesterday with a very grand seigneurial design of
the Duke of Richmond,(869) who has collected a great many fine
casts of the best antique statues, has placed them in a large
room in his garden, and designs to throw it open to encourage
drawing.  I have offered him to let my eagle be cast.

Adieu! If any thing happens, I will not, nor ever do wait for
a regular interval Of Writing to you.

(862) On Admiral Vernon's taking Porto Bello in 1740, the
populace of London celebrated his birthday; and some doubts
arising on the specific day, they celebrated it again, and I
think continued to do so for two or three subsequent years.

(863) He plundered the Electorate so indecently, that on his
return to Paris having built a pavilion in his garden, it was
nicknamed le Pavillon d'Hanovre.

(864) The third Duke of that title.

(865) Henry Furness had been a lord of the treasury.  He was a
friend of Lord Bath, and personally an enemy to Sir Robert
Walpole.

(866) John first Earl Spencer.

(867) Robert Wood, Esq. under secretary of state, Mr. Dawkins,
and Mr. Bouverie.  For a notice of these splendid works, see
ant`e, p. 191, letter 89.-E.

(868) Mr. William Shipley, of Northampton, being persuaded
that a society to give premiums, in the manner of one in
Ireland, would be highly beneficial to the country, came to
London several times in the year 1752 and 1753, and talked
about it to Mr. Henry Baker, who was of the same opinion, but
doubted the possibility of bringing it into effect.  However,
in 1753, a general recommendation of such a society was drawn
up, printed, and dispersed; and indefatigable pains taken by
Mr. Shipley to put it into the hands of persons of quality and
fortune, this scheme was carried into execution.  See
Nichols's Lit. Anecdotes, vol. v. p. 275.-E.

(869) Charles Lenox, third Duke of Richmond.  His grace had
recently ordered a room to be opened at his house in
Whitehall, containing a large collection of original plaster
casts from the best antique busts and statues at Rome -and
Florence, to which all artists, and youths above twelve years
of age, had access. For the encouragement of genius, he also
bestowed two medals annually on those who executed the two
best models.-E.



413 Letter 255
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 10, 1758.

This campaign does not open with the vivacity of the last; the
hero of the age has only taken Schweidnitz yet--he had fought
a battle Or two by this time last year.  But this is the case
of Fame.  A man that astonishes at first, soon makes people
impatient if he does not continue in the same andante key.  I
have heard a good answer of one of the Duke of Marlborough's
generals, who dining with him at a city feast, and being
teased by a stupid alderman, who said to him, "Sir, yours must
be a very laborious employment!" replied, "Oh, no; we fight
about four hours in a morning, and two or three after dinner,
and then we have all the rest of the day to ourselves."  I
shall not be quite so impatient about our own campaign as I
was last year, though we have another secret expedition on
foot--they say, to conquer France, but I believe we must
compound for taking the Isle of Wight, whither we are sending
fourteen thousand men.  The Hero's uncle(870 reviewed them
yesterday in Hyde Park on their setting out.  The Duke of
Marlborough commands, and is, in reality, commanded by Lord
George Sackville.  We shall now see how much greater generals
we have than Mr. Conway, who has pressed to go in any
capacity, and is not suffered!

Mr. Pitt is again laid up with the gout, as the Duke of
Bedford is confined in Ireland by it. - His grace, like other
Kings I have known, is grown wonderfully popular there since
he was taken prisoner and tied hand and foot.  To do faction
justice, it is of no cowardly nature; it abuses while it
attacks, and loads with panegyric those it defeats.  We have
nothing in Parliament but a quiet straggle for an extension of
the Habeas Corpus.(871)  It passed our House swimmingly, but
will be drowned with the same ease in the House of Lords.  On
the new taxes we had an entertaining piece of pomp from the
Speaker: Lord Strange (it was in a committee) said, "I will
bring him down from the gallery." and proposed that the
Speaker should be exempt from the place tax.  He came down,
and besought not to be excepted--lord Strange persisted-so did
the Speaker.  After the debate, Lord Strange going out said,
"Well, did I not show my dromedary well?" I should tell you
that one of the fashionable sights of the winter has been a
dromedary and camel, the proprietor of which has entertained
the town with a droll variety of advertisements.

You would have been amazed, had you been here at Sir luke
Schaub's auction of pictures.  He had picked up some good old
copies cheap when he was in Spain during the contentions there
between the houses of Austria and Bourbon, and when many
grandees being confiscated, the rest piqued themselves on not
profiting of their spoils.  With these Sir Luke had some fine
small ones, and a parcel of Flemish, good in their way.  The
late Prince offered him twelve thousand pounds for the whole,
leaving him the enjoyment for his life.  As he knew the twelve
thousand would not be forthcoming, he artfully excused himself
by saying he loved pictures so much that he knew he should
fling away the money.  Indeed, could he have touched it, it
had been well; the collection was indubitably not worth four
thousand pounds.  It has sold for near eight!(872)  A
Copy(873) of the King of France's Raphael went for seven
hundred pounds.  A Segismonda, called by Corregio, but
certainly by Furoni his scholar, was bought in at upwards of
four hundred pounds.  In short, there is Sir James Lowther,
Mr. Spencer, Sir Richard Grosvenor, boys with twenty and
thirty thousand a-year, and the Duchess of Portland,(874) Lord
Ashburnham, Lord Egremont, and others with near as much, who
care not what they give.  I want to paint my coat and sell it
off my back--there never Was such a season.  I am mad to have
the Houghton pictures sold now; what injury to the creditors
to have them postponed, till half of these vast estates are
spent, and the other half grown ten years older!

Lord Corke Is not the editor of Swift's History;(875) but one
Dr. Lucas, a physicianed apothecary, who some years ago made
such factious noise in Ireland(876)--the book is already
fallen into the lowest contempt. I wish you joy of the success
of the Cocchi family; but how three hundred crowns a year
sound after Sir Luke Schaub's auction!  Adieu! my dear Sir.

(870) George II. uncle of the King of Prussia.

(871) Lord Chesterfield, in a letter to his son of the 8th,
says, "Every thing goes smoothly in Parliament: the King of
Prussia has united all our parties in his support, and the
Tories have declared that they will give Mr. Pitt unlimited
credit for this session: there has not been one single
division yet upon public points, and I believe will not."-E.

(872) The three days' sale produced seven thousand seven
hundred and eighty-four pounds five shillings.-E.

(873) It was purchased by the Duchess Dowager of Portland, for
seven hundred and three pounds ten shillings.-E.

(874) Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley, only daughter of Edward
Harley, second Earl of Oxford, and heiress of the vast
possessions of the Newcastle branch of the Cavendishes.  She
married William Bentinck, second Duke of Portland.-D.

(875) Swift's "History of the Four last Years of Queen Anne,"
was first published in this year.-E.

(876) Dr. Johnson, in a review of Dr. Lucas's Essay on Waters,
which appeared in the Literary Magazine for 1756, thus speaks
of him: "The Irish ministers drove him from his native country
by a proclamation, in which they charge him with crimes of which
they never intended to be called to the proof, and
oppressed him by methods equally irresistible by guilt and
innocence: let the man thus driven into exile, for having been
the friend of his country, be received in every other place as
a confessor of liberty; and let the tools of power be taught
in time, that they may rob, but cannot impoverish."  In 1761,
Dr. Lucas was elected representative for Dublin.  He died in
1771, and a statue to his honour is erected in the Royal
Exchange of Dublin.-E.'



415 Letter 256
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 23, 1758.

Though the inactivity of our parliamentary winter has let me
be correspondent, I am far from having been so remiss as the
posts have made me seem.  I remember to have thought that I
had no letter on board the packet that was taken; but since
the 20th of November I have writ to you on December 14,
January 11, February 9.  The acquittal of General Mordaunt
would, I thought, make you entirely easy about Mr. Conway.
The paper war on their subject is still kept up; but all
inquiries are at an end.  When Mr. Pitt, who is laid up with
the gout, is a little cool again, I think he has too much
eagerness to perform something of `eclatt, to let the public
have to reproach him with not employing so brave a man and so
able as Mr. Conway. Though your brothers do not satisfy your
impatience to know, you must a little excuse them; the eldest
lives out of the world, and James not in that world from
whence he can learn or inform you.  Besides our dear Gal.'s
warmth of friendship, he had innumerable opportunities of
intelligence.  He, who lent all the world money for nothing,
had at least a right to know something.

I shall be sorry on my account if one particular(877) letter
has miscarried, in which I mentioned some trifles that I
wished to purchase from Stosch's collection.  As you do not
mention any approaching sale, I will stay to repeat them till
you tell me that you have received no such letter.

Thank you for the `eloge on your friend poor Cocchi; you had
not told me of his death, but I was prepared for it, and heard
it from Lord Huntingdon.  I am still more obliged to you for
the trouble you have given yourself about King Richard.  You
have convinced me of Crescimbeni's blunder as to Rome.  For
Florence, I must intreat you to send me 'another copy, for
your copyist or his original have made undecipherable
mistakes; particularly in the last line; La Mere Louis is
impossible to be sense: I should wish, as I am to print it, to
have every letter of the whole sonnet more distinct and
certain than most of them are.  I don't know how to repay you
for all the fatigue I give you.  Mr. Fox's urns are arrived,
but not yet delivered from the Custom-house.  You tell me no
more of Botta;(878) is he invisible in dignity, like
Richcourt; or sunk to nothing, like our Poor old friend the
Prince?(879)  Here is a good epigram on the Prince de Soubize,
with which I must conclude, writing without any thing to tell
you, and merely to show you that I do by no means neglect you;

Soubize, apr`es ses grands exploits,
Peut b`atir un palais qui ne lui co`ute gu`ere;
Sa Femme lui fournit le bois,
Et chacun lui jette la pierre.

(877) The letter of Dec. 17th, which was lost.

(878) Marshal Botta, commander at Florence for the Emperor
Francis.

(879) The Prince de Craon, chief of the council, superseded by
the Comte de Richcourt.



416 Letter 257
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, March 21, 1758.

Between my letters of Nov. 20th and Jan.  11th, which you say
you have received, was one of Dec.  11th lost, I suppose in
the packet: what it contained, it is impossible for me to
recollect; but I conclude the very notices about the
expedition, the want of which troubled you so much.  I have
nothing now to tell you of any moment; writing only to keep up
the chain of our 'correspondence, and to satisfy you that
there is nothing particular.

I forgot in my last to say a word of our East Indian hero,
Clive, and his victories; but we are growing accustomed to
success again!  There is Hanover retaken!--if to have Hanover
again is to have success! We have no news but what is
military; Parliaments are grown idle things, or busy like
quarter-sessions.  Mr. Pitt has been in the House of Commons
but twice this winter, yet we have some grumblings: a
Navy-bill of Mr. George Grenville, rejected last year by the
Lords, and passed again by us, has by Mr. Fox's underhand
management been made an affair by the Lords; yet it will pass.
An extension of the Habeas corpus, of forty times the
consequence, is impeded by the same dealings, and IS not
likely to have so prosperous an issue.  Yet these things
scarce make a heat within doors, and scarce conversation
without.

Our new Archbishop(880) died yesterday; but the church loses
its head with as little noise as a question is now carried or
lost in Parliament.

Poor Sir Charles Williams is returned from Russia, having lost
his Senses upon the road.  This is imputed to a lady at
Hamburgh, who gave him, or for whom he took some assistance to
his passion; but we hope he will soon recover.

The most particular thing I know is what happened the other
day: a frantic Earl of Ferrars(881) has for this twelvemonth
supplied conversation by attempting to murder his wife, a
pretty, harmless young woman, and every body that took her
part.  having broken the peace, to which the House of Lords
tied him last year, the cause was trying again there on Friday
last.  Instead of attending it, he went to the assizes at
Hertford to appear against a highwayman, one Page, of
extraordinary parts and escapes.  The Earl had pulled out a
pistol, but trembled so that the robber turned, took it out of
his hand quietly, and said, "My lord, I know you always carry
more pistols about you; give me the rest." At the trial, Page
pleaded that my lord was excommunicated, consequently could
not give evidence, and got acquitted.(882)

There is just published Swift's History of the Four last Years
of Queen Anne: Pope and Lord Bolingbroke always told him it
would disgrace him, and persuaded him to burn it.  Disgrace
him indeed it does, being a weak libel, ill-written for style,
uninformed, and adopting the most errant mob-stories.(883)  He
makes the Duke of Marlborough a coward, Prince Eugene an
assassin, my father remarkable for nothing but impudence, and
would make my Lord Somers any thing but the most amiable
character in the world, if unfortunately he did not praise him
while he tries to abuse.

Trevor(884) of Durham is likely to go to Canterbury.  Adieu!

(880) Archbishop Hutton.  He was succeeded by Secker.

(881) Laurence Shirley, fourth Earl of Ferrars, who, in
January 1760, shot his land-steward, for which he was tried in
Westminster-hall, by his peers, in the following April, and
executed at Tyburn.-E.

(882) At the ensuing Rochester assizes he was tried for
robbing a Mr. Farrington, and executed.-E.

(883) Swift himself, in his Journal to Stella, calls it "his
grand business," and pronounced it "the best work he had ever
written."-E.

(884) Dr. Richard Trevor.  This did not happen.



418 Letter 258
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 14, 1758.

As you was disappointed of any intelligence that might be in it
(I don't know what was), I am sorry my letter of December 14th
miscarried; but with regard to my commissions in Stosch's
collection, it did not signify, since they propose to sell it
in such great morsels.  If they are forced to relent, and
separate it, what I wish to have, and had mentioned to you,
were, "his sculptured gems that have vases on them, of which he
had a large ring box:" the following modern medals, "Anglia
resurges," I think, of Julius III.; "the Capitol; the
Hugonotorum Strages; the Ganymede, a reverse of a Pope's medal,
by Michael Angelo; the first medal of Julius III.;" all these
were in silver, and very fine; then the little Florentine coin
in silver, with Jesus Rex noster on the reverse: he had,
besides, a fine collection of drawings after nudities and
prints in the same style, but you may believe I am not old
enough to give much for these.  I am not very anxious about
any, consequently am not tempted to purchase wholesale.

Thank you for the second copy of King Richard; my book is
finished; I shall send it you by the first opportunity.  I did
receive the bill of lading for Mr. Fox's wine; and my reason
for not telling you how he liked his vases was, because I did
not, nor do yet know, nor does he; they are at Holland House,
and will not be unpacked till he settles there: I own I have a
little more impatience about new things.

My letters will grow more interesting to you, I suppose, as the
summer opens: we have had no Winter campaign, I mean, no
parliamentary war.  You have been much misinformed about the
King's health--and had he been ill, do you think that the
recovery of Hanover would not cure him? Yesterday the new
convention with the King of Prussia was laid before the houses,
and is to be considered next week: I have not yet read it, and
only know that he is to receive from us two millions in three
years, and to make no peace without us.  I hope he will make
one for us before these three years are expired.  A great camp
is forming in the Isle of Wight, reckoned the best spot for
defence or attack.  I suppose both will be tried reciprocally;

Sir Charles Williams's disorder appears to have been
lightheadedness from a fever; he goes about again; but the
world, especially a world of enemies, never care to give up
their title to a man's madness, and will consequently not
believe that he is yet in his senses.(885)

Lord Bristol certainly goes to Spain; no successor is named for
Turin.  You know how much I love a prescriptive situation for
you, and how I should fear a more eminent one--and yet you see
I notify Turin being open, if you should care to push for it.
It is not to recommend it to you that I tell you of it, but I
think it my duty as your friend not to take upon me to decide
for you without acquainting you.

I rejoice at Admiral Osborn's Success.  I am not patriot enough
to deny but that there are captains and admirals whose glory
would have little charms for me; but Osborn was a steady friend
of murdered Byng!

The Earl and Countess of Northumberland have diverted the town
with a supper, which they intended should make their court to
my Lady Yarmouth; the dessert was a chasse at Herenhausen, the
rear of which was brought up by a chaise and six containing a
man with a blue riband and a lady sitting by him!  Did you ever
hear such a vulgarism!  The person complimented is not half so
German, and consequently suffered martyrdom at this clumsy
apotheosis of her concubinage.  Adieu!

(885) On hearing, at Padua, of Sir Charles's indisposition,
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, in a letter to her daughter, the
Countess of Bute, on the 17th of July, breaks out into the
following striking reflections:--"I hear that my old
acquaintance is much broken, both in his spirits and
constitution.  How happy might that man have been, if there had
been added to his natural and acquired endowments a dash of
morality!  If he had known how to distinguish between false and
true felicity; and, instead of seeking to increase an estate
already too large, and hunting after pleasures that have made
him rotten and ridiculous, he had bounded his desires of
wealth, and followed the dictates of his conscience! His
servile ambition has gained him two yards of red riband and an
exile into a miserable country, where there is no society, and
so little taste, that I believe he suffers under a dearth of
flatterers.  This is said for the use of your growing sons,
whom I hope no golden temptations will induce to marry women
they cannot love, or comply with measures they do not approve.
All the happiness this world can afford is more within reach
than is generally supposed.  A wise and honest man lives to his
own heart, without that silly splendour that makes him a prey
to knaves, and which commonly ends in his becoming one of the
fraternity." Works, vol. iii. p. 160.-E.



419 Letter 259
To The Rev. Dr. Birch.
Arlington Street, May 4, 1758.

Sir,
I thought myself very unlucky in being abroad when you were so
good as to call here t'other day.  I not only lost the pleasure
of your company, but the opportunity of obtaining from you
(what however I will not despair of) any remarks you may have
made on the many errors which I fear you found in my book.(886)
The hurry in which it was written, my natural carelessness and
insufficiency, must have produced many faults and mistakes.  As
the curiosity of the world, raised I believe only by the
smallness Of the number printed, makes it necessary for me to
provide another edition, I should be much obliged to whoever
would be enough my friend to point out my wrong judgments and
inaccuracies,--I know nobody, Sir, more capable Of both offices
than yourself, and yet I have no pretensions to ask so great a
favour, unless your own zeal for the cause of literature should
prompt you to undertake a little of this task.  I shall be
always ready to correct my faults, never to defend them.

Walpole had just printed three hundred copies, at the
Strawberry Hill press.-E.



420 Letter 260
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 4, 1758.

You are the first person, I believe, that ever thought of a
Swiss transcribing Welsh, unless, like some commentator on the
Scriptures, you have discovered great affinity between those
languages, and that both are dialects of the Phoenician.  I
have desired your brother to call here to-day, and to help us
in adjusting the inscriptions.  I can find no Lady Cutts in
your pedigree, and till I do, cannot accommodate her with a
coronet.

My book is marvellously in fashion, to my great astonishment.
I did not expect so much truth and such notions of liberty
would have made their fortune in this our day.  I am preparing
an edition for publication, and then I must expect to be a
little less civilly treated.  My Lord Chesterfield tells every
body that he subscribes to all my opinions; but this mortifies
me about as much as the rest flatter me I cannot, because it is
my own case, forget how many foolish books he has diverted
himself with commending The most extraordinary thing I have
heard about mine is, that it being talked of at lord Arran's
table, Doctor King, the Dr. King of Oxford, said of the passage
on my father; "It is very modest, very genteel, and VEry TRUE."
I asked my Lady Cardigan if she would forgive my making free
with her grandmother;(887) she replied very sensibly, "I am
sure she would not have hindered any body from writing against
me; why should I be angry at any writing against her?"

The history promised you of Dr. Brown is this.  Sir Charles
Williams had written an answer to his first silly volume of the
Estimate,(888) chiefly before he came over, but finished while
he was confined at Kensington.  Brown had lately lodged in the
same house, not mad now, though he has been so formerly.  The
landlady told Sir Charles, and offered to make affidavit that
Dr. Brown was the most profane cursor and swearer that ever
came into her house.  Before I proceed in my history, I will
tell you another anecdote of this great performer: one of his
antipathies is the Opera, yet the only time I ever saw him was
in last Passion-week singing the Romish Stabat mater with the
Mingotti, behind a harpsichord at a great concert at my Lady
Carlisle's.  Well--in a great apprehension of Sir Charles
divulging the story of his swearing, Brown went to Dodsley in a
most scurrilous and hectoring manner, threatening Dodsley if he
should publish any thing personal against him; abusing Sir
Charles for a coward and most abandoned man, and bidding
Dodsley tell the latter that he had a cousin in the army who
would call Sir Charles to account for any reflections on him,
Brown.  Stay; this Christian message from a divine, who by the
way has a chapter in his book against duelling, is not all:
Dodsley refused to carry any such message, unless in writing.
The Doctor, enough in his senses to know the consequences of
this, refused; and at last a short verbal message, more
decently worded, was agreed on.  To this Sir Charles made
Dodsley write down this answer: "that he could not but be
surprised at Brown's message, after that he Sir Charles, had,
at Ranby's desire, sent Brown a written assurance that he
intended to say nothing personal of him--nay, nor should yet,
unless Brown's impertinence made it necessary."  This proper
reply Dodsley sent: Brown wrote back, that he should send an
answer to Sir Charles himself; but bid Dodsley take notice,
that printing the works of a supposed lunatic might be imputed
to the printer himself, and which he, the said Doctor, should
chastise.  Dodsley, after notifying this new and unprovoked
insolence to me, Fox, and Garrick, the one friend of Sir
Charles, the other of Brown, returned a very proper, decent,
yet firm answer, with assurances of repaying chastisement of
any sort.  Is it credible? this audacious man sent only a card
back, saying, "Footman's language I never return, J. Brown."
You know how decent, humble, inoffensive a creature Dodsley is;
how little apt to forget or disguise his having been a footman!
but there is no exaggerating this behaviour by reflections.  On
the same card he tells Dodsley that he cannot now accept, but
returns his present of the two last volumes of his collection
of poems, and assures him that they are not soiled by the
reading.  But the best picture of him is his own second volume,
which beats all the Scaligers and Scioppins's for vanity and
insolent impertinence.  What is delightful; in the first volume
he had deified Warburton, but the success of that trumpery has
made Warburton jealous, and occasioned a coolness--but enough
of this jackanapes.

Your brother has been here, and as he is to go to-morrow, and
the pedigree is not quite finished, and as you will be
impatient, and as it is impossible for us to transcribe Welsh
which we cannot read without your assistance, who don't
understand it neither, we have determined that the Colonel
should carry the pedigree to you; you will examine it and bring
it with you to Strawberry, where it can be finished under your
own eye, better than it is possible to do without.  Adieu! I
have not writ so long a letter this age.

422 Letter 261
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, May 31, 1758.

This is rather a letter of thanks than of course, though I have
received, I verily believe, three from you since my last.
Well, then, this is to thank you for them too--chiefly for that
of to-day, with the account of the medals you have purchased
for me from Stosch, and those your own munificence bestows on
me.  I am ashamed to receive the latter; I must positively know
what you paid for the former; and beg they may all be reserved
till a very safe opportunity.  The price for the Ganymede is so
monstrous that I must not regret not having it--yet if ever he
should lower, I should still have a hankering, as it is one of
the finest medals I ever saw.  Are any of the others in silver?
old Stosch had them so.  When any of the other things I
mentioned descend to more mortal rates, I would be sorry to
lose them.

Should not you, if you had not so much experienced the
contrary, imagine that services begot gratitude?  You know they
don't--Shall I tell you what they do beget?--at best,
expectations of more services.  This is my very case now--you
have just been delivered of one trouble for me--I am going to
get you with twins--two more troubles.  In the first place, I
shall beg you to send me a case of liqueurs; in the next all
the medals in copper of my poor departed friend the Pope, for
whom I am as much concerned as his subjects have reason to be.
I don't know whether I don't want samples of his coins, and the
little pieces struck during the sede vacante.  I know what I
shall want, any authentic anecdotes of the conclave.  There!
are there commissions enough? I did receive the Pope's letter
on my inscription, and the translation of the epitaph on
Theodore, and liked both much, and thought I had thanked you
for them--but I perceive I am not half so grateful as
troublesome.

Here is the state of our news and politics.  We thought our
foreign King(889) on the road to Vienna: he is now said to be
prevented by Daun, and to be reduced to besiege Olmutz, which
has received considerable supplies.  Accounts make Louisbourgh
reduced to wait for being taken by us as the easiest way of
avoiding being starved.--In short, we are to be those unnatural
fowl, ravens that carry bread.  But our biggest of all
expectations is from our own invasion of France, which took
post last Sunday; fourteen thousand landmen, eighteen ships of
the line, frigates, sloops, bombs, and four volunteers, Lord
Downe, Sir James Lowther, Sir John Armitage, and Mr. Delaval--
the latter so ridiculous a character, that it has put a stop to
the mode that was spreading.  All this commanded by Lord Anson,
who has beat the French; by the Duke of Marlborough, whose name
has beaten them; and by Lord George Sackville, who is to beat
them.  Every port and town on the coast of Flanders and France
have been guessed for the object.  It is a vast armament,
whether it succeeds or is lost.

At home there are seeds of quarrels.  Pratt the
attorney-general has fallen on a necessary extension of the
Habeas Corpus to private cases.  The interpreting world
ascribes his motive to a want of affection for my Lord
Mansfield, who unexpectedly is supported by the late
Chancellor, the Duke of Newcastle, and that part of the
ministry; and very expectedly by Mr. Fox, as this is likely to
make a breach between the united powers.  The bill passed
almost unanimously through our House.  It will have a very
different fate in the other, where Lord Temple is almost single
in its defence, and where Mr. Pitt seems to have little
influence.  If this should produce a new revolution, you will
not be surprised.  I don't know that it will; but it has
already shown how little cordiality subsists since the last.

I had given a letter for you to a young gentleman of Norfolk,
an only son, a friend of Lord Orford, and of much merit, who
was going to Italy with Admiral Broderick.  He is lost in that
dreadful catastrophe of the Prince George--it makes one regret
him still more, as the survivors mention his last behaviour
with great encomiums.

Adieu! my dear child! -when I look back on my letter, I don't
know whether there would not be more propriety in calling you
my factor.

P. S. I cannot yet learn who goes to Turin: it was offered upon
his old request, to my Lord Orford but he has declined it.

(889) The King of Prussia.



423 Letter 262
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Arlington Street, June 4, 1758.

The Habeas Corpus is finished, but only for this year.  Lord
Temple threatened to renew it the next; on which Lord Hardwicke
took the party of proposing to order the judges to prepare a
bill for extending the power of granting the writ in vacation
to all the judges.  This prevented a division; though Lord
Temple, who protested alone t'other day, had a flaming protest
ready, which was to have been signed by near thirty.  They sat
last night till past nine.  Lord Mansfield spoke admirably for
two hours and twenty-five minutes.  Except Lord Ravensworth and
the Duke of Newcastle, whose meaning the first never knows
himself, and the latter's nobody else, all who spoke spoke
well: they were Lord Temple, Lord Talbot, Lord Bruce, and Lord
Stanhope, for; Lord Morten, Lord Hardwicke, and Lord Mansfield,
against the bill.(890)  T'other day in our House, we had Lady
Ferrars' affair: her sister was heard, and Lord Westmoreland,
who had a seat within the bar.  Mr. Fox opposed the settlement;
but it passed.

The Duke of Grafton has resigned.  Norborne Berkeley has
converted a party of pleasure into a campaign, and is gone with
the expedition,(891) without a shirt but what he had on, and
what is lent him.  The night he sailed he had invited women to
supper.  Besides him, and those you know, is a Mr. Sylvester
Smith.  Every body was asking, "But who is Sylvester Smith?"
Harry Townshend replied, "Why, he is the son of Delaval, who
was the son of Lowther, who was the son of Armitage, who was
the son of Downe."(892)

The fleet sailed on Thursday morning.  I don't know why, but
the persuasion is that they will land on this side Ushant, and
that we shall hear some events by Tuesday or Wednesday.  Some
believe that Lord Anson and Howe have different destinations.
Rochfort, where there are twenty thousand men, is said
positively not to be the place.  the King says there are eighty
thousand men and three marshals in Normandy and Bretagne.
George Selwyn asked General Campbell, if the ministry had yet
told the King the object?

Mademoiselle de l'Enclos is arrived,(893) to my supreme
felicity.  I cannot say very handsome or agreeable: but I had
been prepared on the article of her charms.  I don't say, like
Henry VIII. of Anne of Cleves, that she is a Flanders mare,
though to be sure she Is rather large: on the contrary, I bear
it as well as ever prince did who was married by proxy-and she
does not find me fricass`e dans de la neige."(894)  Adieu!

P. S. I forgot to tell you of another galanterie I have had, -a
portrait of Queen Elizabeth left here while I was out of town.
The servant said it was a present, but he had orders not to say
from whom.

(890) Lord Bute thus bewails the fate of the bill, in a letter
to Mr. Pitt of the same day: "What a terrible proof was Friday,
in the House of Lords, of the total loss of public spirit, and
the most supreme indifference to those valuable rights, for the
obtaining which our ancestors freely risked both life and
fortune! These are dreadful clouds that hang over the future
accession, and damp the hopes I should otherwise entertain of
that important day." Chatham Correspondence, vol. i. p. 317.-E.

(891) The expedition against St. Maloes.

(892) All these gentlemen had been volunteers on successive
expeditions to the coast of France.

(893) The portrait of ninon de l'Enclos.

(894) Madame de S`evign`e, in her letters to her daughter,
reports that Ninon thus expressed herself relative to her son,
the Marquis de Sevign`e, who was one of her lovers.



424 Letter 263
To Dr. Ducarel.
June, 1758.

I am very much obliged to you for the remarks and hints you
sent me on my Catalogue.  They will be of use to me; and any
observations of my friends I shall be very thankful for, and
disposed to employ, to make my book, what it is extremely far
from being, more perfect.  I was very glad to hear, Sir, that
the present Lord Archbishop of Canterbury has continued you in
an employment for which nobody is so fit, and in which nobody
would be so useful.  I wish all manner of success to, as well
as continuance of, your labours; and am, etc. etc.



425 Letter 264
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Sunday morning, June 11, 1758.

This will not depart till to-morrow, by which time probably
there will be more news, but I am obliged to go into the
country to-day, and would not let so much history set out,
without my saying a word of it, as I know you trust to no
gazette but mine.  Last Thursday se'nnight our great expedition
departed from Portsmouth--and soon separated; lord Anson with
the great ships to lie before Brest, and Commodore Howe,(895)
our naval hero, with the transports and a million of small fry
on the secret enterprise.  At one o'clock on Thursday night,
alias Friday morning a cutter brought advice that on Sunday
night the transports had made land in Concalle Bay, near St.
Maloes, had disembarked with no opposition or loss, except of a
boatswain and two sailors, killed from a little fort, to which
Howe was near enough to advise them not to resist.  However,
some peasants in it fired and then ran away.  Some prisoners
have assured our troops that there is no force within twenty
leagues.  This may be apocryphal, a word which, as I am left at
liberty, I always interpret false.  It is plain, however, that
we were not expected at St. Maloes at least.  We are in violent
impatience to hear the consequences--especially whether we have
taken the town, in which there is but one battalion, many old
houses of wood, and the water easily to be cut off.

If you grow wise and ask me with a political face, whether St.
Maloes is an object worth risking fourteen thousand of our best
troops, an expense of fifty thousand pounds, and half of the
purplest blood of England, I shall toss up my head with an air
of heroism and contempt, and only tell you--There! there is the
Duke Of Marlborough in the heart of France; (for in the heroic
dictionary the heart and the coast signify the same thing;)
what would you have? Did Harry V. or Edward III mind whether it
was a rich town or a fishing town, provided they did but take a
town in France? We are as great as ever we were in the most
barbarous ages, and you are asking mercantile Questions with
all the littleness of soul that attends the improvements in
modern politics!  Well! my dear child, I smile, but I tremble-.
and though it is pleasanter to tremble when one invades, than
when one is invaded, I don't like to be at the eve even of an
Agincourt.  There are so many of my friends upon heroic ground,
that I discern all their danger through all their laurels.
Captain Smith, aide-de-camp to Lord George Sackville, dated his
letter to the Duke of Dorset, "from his Majesty's dominions in
France."  Seriously, what a change is here!  His Majesty, since
this time twelvemonth, had not only recovered his dominions in
Germany, but is on the acquiring foot in France.  What heads,
what no heads must they have in France!  Where are their
Cardinals, their Saxes, their Belleisles?  Where are their
fleets, their hosts, their arts, their subsidies?  Subsidies,
indeed!  Where are ours? we pay none, or almost none, and are
ten times greater than when we hired half Europe.  In short,
the difference of our situation is miraculous; and if we can
but keep from divisions at home, and the King of Prussia does
not prosper too fast for us, we may put France and ourselves
into situations to prevent them from being formidable to us for
a long season.  Should the Prussian reduce too suddenly the
Empress-Queen to beg and give him a secure peace, considering
how deep a stake he still plays for, one could not well blame
his accepting it--and then we should still be to struggle with
France.

But while I am politicising, I forget to tell you half the
purport of my letter--part indeed you will have heard; Prince
Ferdinand's passage of Rhine, the most material circumstance of
which, in my opinion, is the discovery of the amazing weakness
of the French in their army, discipline, councils, and conduct.
Yesterday, as If to amuse us agreeably till we hear again from
St. Maloes, an express arrived of great conquests and captures
which three of our ships have made on the river Gambia, to the
destruction of the French trade and settlements there.  I don't
tell you the particulars, because I don't know them, and
because you see them in the gazette.  In one week we strike a
medal with Georgius, Germanicus, Gallicus, Africanus.

Mr. M'Kinsy, brother of Lord Bute, has kissed hands for Turin;
you remember him at Florence.  He is very well-bred, and you
will find him an agreeable neighbour enough.

I have seen the vases at Holland-house, and am perfectly
content with them: the forms are charming.  I assure you Mr.
Fox and Lady Caroline do not like them less than I do.  Good
night! am not I a very humane conqueror to condescend to write
so long a letter?

(895) Richard, after the death of his elder brother, Viscount
Howe.



426 Letter 265
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
June 16, 1758, 2 o'clock noon.

Well, my dear Harry! you are not the only man in England who
have not conquered France!(896)  Even Dukes of Marlborough have
been there without doing the business.  I don't doubt but your
good heart has even been hoping, in spite of your
understanding, that our heroes have not only taken St. Maloes,
but taken a trip cross the country to burn Rochefort, only to
show how easy it was.  We have waited with astonishment at not
hearing that the French court was removed in a panic to Lyons,
and that the Mesdames had gone off in their shifts with only a
provision of rouge for a week.  Nay, for my part, I expected to
be deafened with encomiums on my Lord Anson's continence, who,
after being allotted Madame Pompadour as his share of the
spoils, had again imitated Scipio, and, in spite of the
violence of his temperament, had restored her unsullied to the
King of France.  Alack! we have restored nothing but a quarter
of a mile of coast to the right owners.  A messenger arrived in
the middle of the night with an account that we have burned two
frigates and an hundred and twenty small fry; that it was found
impossible to bring up the cannon against the town; and that,
the French army approaching the coast, Commodore Howe, with the
expedition of Harlequin as well as the taciturnity, re-embarked
our whole force in seven hours, volunteers and all, with the
loss only of one man, and they are all gone to seek their
fortune somewhere else.  Well! in half a dozen more wars we
shall know something of the coast of France.  Last war we
discovered a fine bay near Port l'Orient: we have now found out
that we know nothing of St. Maloes.  As they are popular
persons, I hope the city of London will send some more gold
boxes to these discoverers.  If they send a patch-box to Lord
George Sackville, it will hold all his laurels.  As our young
nobility cannot at present travel through France, I suppose
that is a method for finishing their studies.  George Selwyn
says he supposes the French ladies will have scaffolds erected
on the shore to see the English go by.  But I won't detain the
messenger any longer; I am impatient to make the Duchess(897)
happy, who I hope will soon see the Duke returned from his
coasting voyage.

The Churchills will be with you next Wednesday, and I believe I
too; but I can take my own word so little, that I will not give
it you.  I know I must be back at Strawberry on Friday night;
for Lady Hervey and Lady Stafford are to be there with me for a
few days from to-morrow se'nnight.  Adieu!

(896) Alluding to the expedition against Rochefort, the year
before, in which Mr. Conway was second in command.

Countess of Ailesbury by                   her first marriage.

Richmond's absence, who was a volunteer upon this expedition



427 Letter 266
To The Earl Of Strafford.
Arlington Street, June 16, 1758.

My dear lord,
Dear lord, I stayed to write to you, in obedience to your
commands, till I had something worth telling you.  St. Maloes
is taken by storm.  The Governor leaped into the sea at the
very name of the Duke of Marlborough.  Sir James Lowther put
his hand into his pocket, and gave the soldiers two hundred and
fifty thousand pounds to drink the King's health on the top of
the great church.  Norborne Berkeley begged the favour of the
Bishop to go back with him and see his house in
Gloucestershire. Delaval is turned capuchin, with remorse, for
having killed four thousand French with his own hand. Commodore
Howe does nothing but talk of what he has done. Lord Downe, who
has killed the intendant, has sent for Dupr`e(898) to put in
his place; and my Lord Anson has ravished three abbesses, the
youngest of whom was eighty-five.  Sure, my lord, this account
is glorious enough! Don't you think one might 'bate a little of
it?  How much will you give up?  Will you compound for the town
capitulating, and for threescore men of war and two hundred
privateers burned in the harbour? I would fain beat you down as
low as I could. What,
if we should not have taken the town? Shall you be very much
shocked, if, after burning two ships of fifty-four and
thirty-six guns, and a bushel of privateers and smallware, we
had thought it prudent to leave the town where we found it, and
had re-embarked last Monday in seven hours, (the despatch of
which implies at least as much precipitation as conduct,) and
that of all the large bill of fare above, nothing should be
true but Downe's killing the intendant; who coming out to
reconnoitre, and not surrendering, Downe, at the head of some
grenadiers, shot him dead.  In truth, this is all the truth, as
it came in the middle Of the night; and if your lordship is
obstinately bent on the conquest of France, you must wait till
we have found another loophole into it, which it seems our
fleet is gone to look for.  I fear it is not even true that we
have beat them in the Mediterranean!  nor have I any hopes but
in Admiral Forbes, who must sail up the Rhone, burn Lyons, and
force them to a peace at once.

I hope you have had as favourable Succession of sun and rain as
we have. I go to Park-place next week, where I fancy I Shall
find our little Duchess(899) quite content with the prospect of
recovering her Duke, without his being provided with laurels like
a boar's head.  Adieu! my dear lord.  My best compliments to my
lady and her whole menagerie.

(898) A French master.

(899) of richmond.



428 Letter 267
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, June 18, 1758.

I write to you again so soon, only to laugh at my last letter.
What a dupe was I! at my years to be dazzled with glory! to be
charmed with the rattle of drums and trumpets, till I fancied
myself at Cressy or Poictiers!  In the middle of all this dream
of conquest, just when I had settled in what room of my castle
I would lodge the Duke of Alen`con or Montpensier, or whatever
illustrious captive should be committed to the custody of
Seneschal Me, I was awakened with an account of our army having
re-embarked, after burning some vessels at St. Maloes.  This is
the history, neither more nor less, of this mighty expedition.
They found the causeway broken up, stayed from Tuesday night
till Monday morning in sight of the town; agreed it was
impregnable; heard ten thousand French (which the next day here
were erected into thirty thousand) were coming against them;
took to their transports, and are gone to play at hide and seek
somewhere else.  This campaign being rather naked, is coloured
over with the great damage we have done, and with the fine
disposition and despatch made for getting away--the same
colours that would serve to paint pirates or a flight.
However, the city is pleased; and Mr. Pitt maintains that he
never intended to take St. Maloes, which I believe, because
when he did intend to have Rochefort taken last year, he sent
no cannon; this year, when he never meant to take St. Maloes,
he sent a vast train of artillery.  Besides, one of the most
important towns in France, lying some miles up in the country,
was very liable to be stormed; a fishing town on the coast is
naturally impracticable.  The best side of the adventure is,
that they were very near coming away without attempting the
conflagration, and only thought of it by chance--then indeed

Diripuere focos--
Atqui omnis facibus Pubes accingitur atris.

Perhaps the metamorphosis in Virgil of the ships into mermaids
is not more absurd than an army of twelve or thirteen thousand
of the flower of our troops and nobility performing the office
of link-boys, making a bonfire, and running away!  The French
have said well, "les Anglois viennent nous casser des vitres
avec des guin`ees."(900)  We have lost six men, they five, and
about a hundred vessels, from a fifty-gun ship to a
mackerel-boat.

I don't only ask my own pardon for swelling out my imagination,
but yours, for making you believe that you was to be
representative of the Black Prince or Henry V. I hope you had
sent no bullying letter to the conclave on the (,authority of
my last letter, to threaten the cardinals, that if they did not
elect the Archbishop of Canterbury Pope, you would send for
part of the squadron from St. Maloes to burn Civita Vecchia.  I
had promised you the duchy of Bretagne, and we have lost
Madras!

Our expedition is still afloat--whither bound, I know not; but
pray don't bespeak any more laurels; wait patiently for what
they shall send you from the Secretary's office.

I gave your brother James my new work to send you-I grieve that
I must not, as usual, send a set for poor Dr. Cocchi.  Good
night!

(900) "Mr. Pitt's friends exult on the destruction of three
French ships of war, and one hundred and thirty privateers and
trading ships, and affirm that it stopped the march of three
score thousand men, who were going to join the Comte de
Clermont's army.  On the other hand, Mr. Fox and company call
it breaking windows with guineas, and apply the fable of the
mountain and the mouse." Lord Chesterfield.-E.



430 Letter 268
To Sir David Dalrymple.(901)
Strawberry Hill, June 29, 1758.

Sir,
Inaccurate and careless, as I must own my book is,(902) I
cannot quite repent having let it appear in that state, since
it has procured me so agreeable and obliging a notice from a
gentleman whose approbation makes me very vain.  The trouble
you have been so good as to give yourself, Sir, is by no means
lost upon me; I feel the greatest gratitude for it, and shall
profit not only of your remarks, but with your permission of
your very words, wherever they will fall in with my text.  The
former are so judicious and sensible, and the latter so well
chosen, that if it were not too impertinent to propose myself
as an example, I should wish, Sir, that you would do that
justice to the writers of your own country, which my ignorance
has made me execute so imperfectly and barrenly.

Give me leave to say a few words to one or two of your notes.
i should be glad to mention more instances of Queen Elizabeth's
fondness for praise,(903) but fear I have already been too
diffuse on her head.  Bufo(904) is certainly Lord Halifax: the
person at whom you hint is more nearly described by the name of
Bubo, and I think in one place is even called Bubb.(905)  The
number of volumes of Parthenissa I took from the list of Lord
Orrery's(906) writings in the Biographia: it is probable,
therefore, Sir, that there were different editions of that
romance.  You will excuse my repeating once more, Sir, my
thanks for your partiality to a work so little worthy of your
favour.  I even flatter myself that whenever you take a journey
this way, you will permit me to have the honour of being
acquainted with a gentleman to whom I have so particular an
obligation.

(901) Now first collected.  This eminent lawyer, antiquary, and
historian was born in 1726.  He was educated at Eton, and
afterwards studied civil law at Utrecht.  In 1748, he was
called to the Scotch bar, and in 1766 made a judge of session,
when he assumed the name of Lord Hailes.  Boswell states, that
Dr. Johnson, in 1763, drank a bumper to him "as a man of worth,
a scholar, and a wit." His "Annals of Scotland" the Doctor
describes as "a work which has such a stability of dates, such
a certainty of facts, and such a punctuality of citation, that
it must always sell." He wrote several papers in the World and
Mirror.  He died in 1792.-E.

(902) The Royal and Noble Authors.-E.

(903) Queen Elizabeth, who had turned Horace's Art of Poetry
into English, having been offended with Sir Francis Bacon, the
Earl of Essex, to recommend him again to favour, artfully told
her, that his suit was not so much for the good of Bacon, as
for her own honour, that those excellent translations of hers
might be known to those who could best judge of them.-E.

431 Letter 269
To John Chute, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, June 29, 1758.

The Tower-guns have sworn through thick and thin that Prince
Ferdinand has entirely demolished the French, and the
city-bonfires all believe it.  However, as no officer is yet
come, nor confirmation, my crackers suspend their belief.  Our
great fleet is stepped ashore again near Cherbourg; I suppose,
to singe half a yard more of the coast.  This is all I know;
less, as you may perceive, than any thing but the Gazette.

What is become of Mr. Montagu? Has he stolen to Southampton,
and slipped away a-volunteering like Norborne Berkeley, to
conquer France in a dirty shirt and a frock?  He might gather
forty load more of laurels in my wood.  I wish I could flatter
myself that you would come with him.

My Lady Suffolk has at last entirely submitted her barn to our
ordination.  As yet it is only in Deacon;s orders; but will
very soon have our last imposition of hands.  Adieu! Let me
know a word of you.



431 Letter 270
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 6, 1758.

You may believe I was thoroughly disappointed in not seeing you
here, as I expected.  I grieve for the reason, and wish you had
told me that your brother was quite recovered.  Must I give you
over for the summer? sure you are in my debt.

That regiments are going to Germany is certain; which, except
the Blues) I know not.  Of all secrets I am not in any Irish
ones.  I hope for your sake, your Colonel(907) is not of the
number; but how can you talk in the manner you do of Prince
Ferdinand! Don't you know that, next to Mr. Pitt and Mr.
Delaval, he is the most fashionable man in England?  Have not
the Tower-guns, and all the parsons in London, been ordered to
pray for him? You have lived in Northamptonshire till you are
ignorant that Hanover is in Middlesex, as the Bishop's palace
at Chelsea is in the diocese of Winchester.  In hopes that you
will grow better acquainted with your own country, I remain
your affected Horatius Valpolhausen.

(907) Mr. Montagu's brother.

To The Rev. Dr. Birch.
Arlington Street, July 8, 1758.


Sir,
As you have been so good as to favour me with your assistance,
I flatter myself you will excuse my begging it once more.  I am
told that you mentioned to Dr. Jortin a Lord Mountjoy, who
lived in the reign of Henry VIII. as an author.  Will you be so
good as to tell me any thing you know of him, and what he
wrote.  I shall entreat the favour of this notice as soon as
possibly you can; because my book is printing off, and I am
afraid of being past the place where he must come in.  I am
just going out of town, but a line put into the Post any night
before nine o'clock will find me next morning at Strawberry
Hill.



432 Letter 272
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(908)
Arlington Street, July 8, 1758.

You have made me laugh; do you think I found much difficulty to
persist in thinking as well of you as I used to do, though you
have neither been so great a Poliorcetes as Almanzor, who could
take a town alone, nor have executed the commands of another
Almanzor, who thought he could command the walls of a city to
tumble down as easily as those of Jericho did to the march of
Joshua's first regiment of Guards? Am I so apt to be swayed by
popular clamour.  But I will say no more on that head.  As to
the wording of the sentence, I approve your objection; and as I
have at least so little of the author in me as to be very
corrigible, I will, if you think proper, word the beginning
thus:--

"In dedicating a few trifles(909) to you, I have nothing new to
tell the world.  My esteem still accompanies your merit, on
which 'it was founded, and to which, with such abilities as
mine, I can only bear testimony; I must not pretend to
vindicate it.  If your virtues," etc.  It shall not be said
that I allowed prejudice and clamour to be the voice of the
world against you.  I approve, too, the change of "proposed"
for "would have undertaken;" but I cannot like putting in
"prejudice and malice."  When One accuses others of malice, one
is a little apt to feel it; and if I could flatter myself that
such a thing as a Dedication would have weight, or that any
thing of mine would last, I would have it look as dispassionate
as possible.  When after some interval I assert coolly that you
was most wrongfully blamed, I shall be believed.  If I seem
angry, it will look like a party quarrel still existing.

Instead of resenting your not being employed in the present
follies, I think you might write a letter of thanks to my Lord
Ligonier, Or to Mr. Pitt, or even to the person who is
appointed to appoint generals himself,(910) to thank them for
not exposing you a second year.  All the puffs in the
newspapers cannot long stifle the ridicule which the French
will of course propagate through all Europe on the foolish
figure we have made.  You shall judge by one sample: the Duc
d'Aiguillon has literally sent a vessel with a flag of truce to
the Duke of Marlborough, with some teaspoons which, in his
hurry, he left behind him.  I know the person who saw the
packet before it was delivered to the Blenheimeius.  But what
will you say to this wise commander himself? I am going to tell
you no secret, but what he uttered publicly at the levee.  The
King asked him, if he had raised great contributions?
"Contributions, Sir! we saw nothing but old women." What
becomes of the thirty thousand men that made them retire with
such expedition to their transports? My Lord Downe, as decently
as he can, makes the greatest joke of their enterprise, and has
said at Arthur's, that.,five hundred men posted with a grain of
common sense would have cut them all to pieces.  I was not less
pleased at what M. de Monbagon, the young prisoner, told
Charles Townshend t'other day at Harley's: he was actually at
Rochfort when you landed, where he says they had six thousand
men, most impatient for your approach, and so posted that not
one of you would ever have returned.  This is not an evidence
to be forgot.

Howe and Lord George Sackville are upon the worst terms, as the
latter is with the military too.  I can tell you some very
curious anecdotes when I see you; but what I do not choose, for
particular reasons, to write.  What is still more curious, when
Lord George kissed hands at Kensington, not a word was said to
him.

How is your fever? tell me, when you have a mind to write, but
don't think it necessary to answer my gazettes; indeed I don't
expect it.

(908) Now first printed.

(909) The little Volume of Fugitive Pieces, printed this year
at the Strawberry Hill press.

433 Letter 273
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 8, 1758.

If you will not take Prince Ferdinand's victory at Crevelt in
full of all accounts, I don't know what you will do--autrement,
we are insolvent.  After dodging about the coasts of Normandy
and Bretagne, our armada is returned; but in the hurry of the
retreat from St. Maloes, the Duke of Marlborough left his
silver teaspoons behind.  As he had generously sent back an old
woman's finger and gold ring, which one of our soldiers had cut
off, the Duc d'Aiguillon has sent a cartel-ship with the
prisoner-spoons.  How they must be diverted with this
tea-equipage, stamped with the Blenheim eagles! and how plain
by this sarcastic compliment what they think of US! Yet We
fancy that we detain forty thousand men on the coast from
Prince Clermont's army! We are sending nine thousand men to
Prince Ferdinand; part, those of the expedition: the remainder
are to make another attempt; perhaps to batter Calais with a
pair of tea-tongs.

I am sorry for the Comte de la Marche, and much more sorry for
the Duc de Gisors.(911)  He was recommended to me when he was
in England; I knew him much, and thought as well of him as all
the world did.  He was graver, and with much more application
to improve himself, than any young Frenchman of quality I ever
saw.  How unfortunate Belleisle is, to have outlived his
brother, his only son, and his hearing! You will be charmed
with an answer of Prince Ferdinand to our Princess Gouvernante
of Holland.(912)  She wrote by direction of the States to
complain of his passing over the territories of the Republic.
He replied, "That he was sorry, though he had barely crossed
over a very small corner of their dominions; and should not
have trespassed even there, if he had had the same Dutch guides
to conduct him that led the French army last year to Hanover."

I congratulate 'you on your regale from the Northumberlands.
How seldom people think of all the trouble and expense they put
you to--I amongst the rest!  Apropos, if they are not bespoken,
I will not trouble you for the case of drams.  Lord Hertford
has given me some of his; the fashion is much on the decline,
and never drinking any myself, these will last me long enough
and considering that I scarce ever give you a commission, but
somehow or other ends at your expense, (witness the medals you
gave me of your own,) it is time for me to check my pen that
asks so flippantly.  As I am not mercenary, I cannot bear to
turn you to account; if I was, I should bear it very easily:
but it is ridiculous to profit of one's friends, when one does
not make friendships with that view.

Methinks you don't make a Pope very fast.  The battle of
Crevelt has restored him a little, or the head of our church
was very declining.  He said the other day to Lady Coventry in
the drawing-room, "Don't look at me, I am a dismal figure; I
have entirely lost one eye."Adieu!

(911) Only son of Marshal Belleisle; he was killed at the
battle of Crevelt: the Comte de la Marche was not.

(912) Anne, eldest daughter of George II. and Princess Dowager
of Orange.



434 Letter 274
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Strawberry Hill, July 21, 1758.

Your gazette, I know, has been a little idle; but we volunteer
gazettes, like other volunteers, are not easily tied down to
regularity and rules.  We think we have so much merit, that we
think we have a right to some demerit too; and those who depend
upon us, I mean us gazettes, are often disappointed, A
common-foot newspaper may want our vivacity, but is ten times
more useful.  Besides, I am not in town, and ten miles out of
it is an hundred miles out of it for all the purposes of news .
You know, of course, that Lord George Sackville refused to go
a-buccaneering again, as he called it; that my friend Lord
Ancram, who loves a dram of any thing, from glory to brandy, is
out of order; that just as Lord Panmure was going to take the
command,@e missed an eye; and that at last they have routed out
an old General Blighe from the horse armoury in Ireland, who is
to undertake the codicil to the expedition.  Moreover, you know
that Prince Edward is bound 'prentice to Mr. Howe.(913)  All
this you have heard; yet, like my cousin the Chronicle, I
repeat what has been printed in every newspaper of the week,
and then finish with one paragraph of spick and span.  Alack!
my postscript is not very fortunate: a convoy of twelve
thousand men, etc. was going to the King of' Prussia, was
attacked unexpectedly by five thousand Austrians, and cut
entirely to pieces; provisions, ammunition, etc. all taken.
The King instantly raised the siege, and retreated with so much
precipitation, that he was forced to nail up sixty pieces of
cannon.  I conclude the next we hear of him will be a great
victory-. if he sets over night in a defeat, he always rises
next morning in a triumph--at least, we that have nothing to do
but expect and admire, shall be extremely disappointed if he
does not.  Besides, he is three months debtor to Fame.

The only private history of any freshness is, my Lady
Dalkeith's christening; the child had three godfathers: and I
will tell you why: they had thought of the Duke of Newcastle,
my Lord and George Townshend: but of two Townshends and his
grace, God could not take the word of any two of them, so all
three were forced to be bound.

I draw this comfort from the King of Prussia's defeat, that it
may prevent the folly of another expedition: I don't know how
or why, but no reason is a very good one against a thing that
has no reason in it.  Eleven hundred men are ill from the last
enterprise.  Perhaps Don William Quixote(914) and Admiral
Amadis(915) may determine to send them to the Danube: for, as
no information ever precedes their resolutions, and no
impossibilities ever deter them, I don't see why the Only thing
worthy their consideration should not be, how glorious and
advantageous an exploit it would be, if it could be performed.
Why did Bishop Wilkins try to fly? Not that he thought it
practicable, but because it would be very convenient.  As he
did not happen to be a particular favourite of the city of
London, he was laughed at: they prepossessed in his favour, and
he would have received twenty gold boxes, though twenty people
had broken their neck off St. Paul's with trying the
experiment.

I have heard a whisper, that you do not go into Yorkshire this
summer.  Is it true? It is fixed that I go to Ragley(916) on
the 13th of next month; I trust you do so too.  have you had
such deluges for three weeks well counted, as we have?  If I
had not cut one of my perroquet's wings, and there were an
olive-tree in the country, I would send to know where there is
a foot of dry land.

You have heard, I suppose,--if not, be it known to you,--that
Mr. Keppel, the canon of Windsor, espouses my niece Laura; yes,
Laura.(917)  I rejoice much; so I receive your compliments upon
if, lest you as it sometimes happens, forget to make them.
Adieu!

July 22.

For the pleasure of my conscience I had written all the above
last night, expecting Lord Lyttelton, the Dean, and other
company, This morning I receive yours; and having already told
you all I know, I have only a few paragraphs to answer.

I am pleased that you are pleased about my book:(918) you shall
see it very soon; though there will scarce be a new page:
nobody else shall see it till spring.  In the first place, the
prints will not be finished: in the next, I intend that two or
three other things shall appear before it from my press, of
other authors; for I will not surfeit people with my writings,
nor have them think that I propose to find employment alone for
a whole press--so far from it, I intend to employ it no more
about myself.

I will certainly try to see you during your waiting.,' Adieu!

436 Letter 275
To The Rev. Henry Zouch.(920)
Strawberry Hill, August 3d, 1758.

Sir,
I have received, with much pleasure and surprise, the favour of
your remarks upon my Catalogue; and whenever I have the
opportunity of being better known to you, I shall endeavour to
express my gratitude for the trouble you have given yourself in
contributing to perfect a work,(921) which, notwithstanding
your obliging expressions, I fear you found very little worthy
the attention of so much good sense and knowledge, Sir, as you
possess.  I am extremely thankful for all the information you
have given me; I had already met with a few of the same lights
as I have received, Sir, from you, as I shall mention in their
place.  The very curious accounts of Lord Fairfax were entirely
new and most acceptable to me.  If I decline making use of one
or two of your hints, I believe I can explain my reasons to
your satisfaction.  I will, with your leave, go regularly
through your letter.

As Caxton(922) laboured in the monastery of Westminster, it is
not at all unlikely that he should wear the habit, nor,
considering how vague our knowledge of that age is, impossible
but he might enter the order.

I have met with Henry's institution of a Christian, and shall
give you an account of it in my next edition.  In that, too, I
shall mention, that Lord Cobham's(923) allegiance professed at
his death to Richard II. probably means to Richard and his
right heirs, whom he had abandoned for the house of Lancaster.
As the article is printed off, it is too late to say any thing
more about his works.

In all the old books of genealogy you will find, Sir, that
young Richard Duke of York(924) was solemnly married to a child
of his own age, Anne Mowbray, the heiress of Norfolk, who died
young as well as he.

The article of the Duke of Somerset is printed off too;
besides, I should imagine the letter you mention not to be of
his own composition, for, though not illiterate, he certainly
could not write any thing like classic Latin.(925) I may, too,
possibly, have inclusively mentioned the very letter; I have
not Ascham's book, to see from what copy the letter was taken,
but probably from one of those which I have said is in Bennet
Library.

The Catalogue of Lord Brooke's works is taken from the volume
of his works; such pieces of his as I found doubted,
particularly the tragedy of Cicero, I have taken notice of as
doubtful.

In my next edition you will see, Sir, a note on Lord Herbert,
who, besides being with the King at York, had offended the
peers by a speech in his Majesty's defence.  Mr. Wolseley's
preface I shall mention, from your information.  Lord
Rochester's letters to his son are letters to a child, bidding
him mind his book and his grandmother.  I had already been
told, Sir, what you tell me of marchmont Needham.

Matthew Clifford I have altered to Martin, as you prescribe:
the blunder was my own, as well as a more considerable one,
that of Lord Sandwich's death--which was occasioned by my
supposing at first, that the translation of Barba(926) was made
by the second earl, whose death I had marked in the list, and
forgot to alter, after I had writ the account of the father.  I
shall take care to set this right, as the second volume is not
yet begun to be printed.

Lord Halifax's maxims I have already marked down, as I shall
Lord Dorset's share in Pompey.

The account of the Duke of Wharton's death I had from a very
good hand--Captain Willoughby; who, in the convent where the
duke died, saw a picture of him in the habit.  If it was a
Bernardine convent, the Gentleman might confound them; but,
considering that there is no life of the duke but bookseller's
trash, it is much more likely that they mistook.

I have no doubts about Lord Belhaven's speeches; but unless I
could verify their being published by himself, it were contrary
to my rule to insert them.

If you look, Sir, into Lord Clarendon's account Of Montrose's
death, you will perceive that there is no probability of the
book of his actions being composed by himself.

I will consult Sir James Ware's book on Lord Totness's and I
will mention the Earl of Cork's Memoirs.

Lord Lessington is the Earl of Monmouth, in whose article I
have taken notice of his Romulus and Tarquin.

Lord Berkeley's book I have actually got, and shall give him an
article.

There is one more passage, Sir, in your letter, which I cannot
answer, without putting you to new trouble-a liberty which all
your indulgence cannot justify me in taking; else I would beg
to know on what authority you attribute to Laurence Earl of
Rochester(927) the famous preface to his father's history,
which I have always heard ascribed to Atterbury, Smallridge,
and Aldridge.  The knowledge of this would be an additional
favour; it would be a much greater, Sir, if coming this way,
you would ever let me have the honour of seeing a gentleman to
whom I am so much obliged.


(920) The Rev. Henry Zouch was the elder brother of Dr. Thomas
Zouch, better known in the literary world.  Henry principally
dedicated himself to the performance of his duties as a
clergyman, a country gentleman and a magistrate; in all which
characters he was highly exemplary.  He published several works
connected with these avocations, particularly on the management
of prisons, and on other points of police.  He had, also,
earlier days, been a poet; and these letters show that he was
well acquainted with the literary history and antiquities of
his country.  Having lived in close intimacy and friendship
with Mr. Walpole's friend and correspondent, William Earl of
Strafford, it is probable that through him he became interested
in Mr. Walpole's pursuits, and disposed to contribute that
assistance towards the perfection of the "Catalogue of Royal
and Noble authors," which is so justly acknowledged by Mr.
Walpole.  Mr. Zouch died at the family seat of sandall, in
Yorkshire, of which parish he was also vicar, in June, 1795;
leaving his friend and kinsman, the Earl of lonsdale, his
executor, by whose favour these letters are now given to the
public.  The exact time of his birth is not ascertained; but as
he was an A. B. of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1746, he
probably was born about 1725.-C.  [Mr. Walpole's Letters to the
Rev. Henry Zouch first appeared in the year 1805, edited by the
Right Honourable John Wilson Croker; to whose notes the initial
C. is affixed.]

(921) The "Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors," originally
published by Mr. Walpole in 1758.  Mr. Zouch appears to have
commenced the correspondence on the occasion of this
publication.  The author of the Catalogue received much of the
same kind of assistance as was given to him by Mr. Zouch; but
as editor, Mr. Park, says, "it would seem that Lord Orford was
more thankful for communications tendered, than desirous to let
the contents of them be seen."-C.

(922) It is probable that Mr. Zouch objected to Mr. Walpole's
assertion, that the illumination prefixed to a manuscript in
Lambeth library, of Earl Rivers's translation of "The Dictes
and Sayings of the Philosophers, by Jehan de Teonville,"
represented the Earl introducing Caxton to Edward IV.  Mr.
Zouch seems to have very properly doubted whether Caxton would
wear the clerical habit, as the figure referred to in that
illumination does; and Mr. Walpole replies to that doubt.  Upon
the same subject, Mr. Cole says, qu. how Lord Orford came to
know the kneeling figure in a clerical habit, was Caxton the
printer?  He is certainly a priest, as is evident from his
tonsure, but I do not think that Caxton was in orders.  I
should rather suppose that it was designed for Jehan de
Teonville, provost of Paris."-C.

(923) Mr. Walpole did make this promised statement in the
following note: "King Richard had long been dead; I suppose it
is only meant that Lord Cobham disclaimed obedience to the
house of Lancaster, who had usurped the throne of King Richard
and his right heirs."-C.

(924) He was married on the 15th of January, 1477-8, in the
fourth year of his age.-C.

(925) In a subsequent edition Mr. Walpole recites the title of
this letter, "Epistola exhortatoria missa ad Nobilitatem ac
Plebem universumque Populum Regni Scotiae," printed in 4to. at
London, 1548; and he adds, this might possibly be composed by
some dependant.  We do not exactly see the grounds of Walpole's
assertion, that the Lord Protector Somerset "could not write
any thing like classic Latin;": although we admit that his
having been chancellor of Cambridge is not conclusive evidence
upon this subject; and that it is probable that the letter was
written by his secretary.-C.

(926) "The Art of Metals, in which is declared the manner of
their generation."  Albara Alonzo Barba was curate of St.
Bernard's in Potosi.  This work, which contains a great deal of
practical information on mining, has also been translated into
German and French.  The English editions are very scarce, and a
republication might be desirable in this age of mining
adventure.-C.

(927) Second son of the great Lord Clarendon.  Mr. Walpole
makes no mention of this preface, but Mr. Park seems to have
entertained the same idea as Mr. Zouch, as he says, "His
lordship merits honourable notice in the present work, as the
conceived author of a preface to the first edition of his noble
father's history, which abounds with dignified sentiment and
filial reverence."-C.



439 Letter 276
To The Rev. Henry Zouch.
Strawberry Hill, August 12, 1758.

Sir,
It were a disrespect to your order, of which I hope you think
me incapable, not to return an immediate answer to the favour
of your last, the engaging modesty of which would raise my
esteem if I had not felt it before for you.  I certainly do not
retract my desire of being better acquainted with you, Sir,
from the knowledge you are pleased to give me of yourself.
Your profession is an introduction any where; but, before I
learned that, you will do me the justice to observe, that your
good sense and learning were to me sufficient recommendation;
and though, in the common intercourse of the world, rank and
birth have their proper distinctions, there is certainly no
occasion for them between men whose studies and inclinations
are the same.  Indeed, I know nothing that gives me any
pretence to think any gentlemen my inferior.  I am a very
private person myself, and if I have any thing to boast from my
birth, it is from the good understanding, not from the nobility
of my father.  I must beg, therefore, that, in the future
correspondence, which I hope we shall have, you will neither
show me, nor think I expect, a respect to which I have no
manner of title, and which I wish not for, unless it would
enable me to be of service to gentlemen of merit, like
yourself.  I will say no more on this head, but to repeat, that
if any occasion should draw you to this part of England, (as I
shall be sorry if it is ill health that has carried you from
home,) I flatter myself you will let me have the satisfaction
and, for the last time of using so formal a word, the honour of
seeing you.

In the mean time, you will oblige me by letting me know how I
can convey my Catalogue to you.  I ought, I know, to stay till
I can send you a more correct edition; but, though the first
volume is far advanced, the second may profit by your remarks.
If you could send me the passage and the page in Vardus,
relating to the Earl of Totness, it would much oblige ne; for I
have only the English edition; and as I am going a little
journey for a week, cannot just now get the Latin.

You mention, Sir, Mr. Thoresby's museum: is it still preserved
entire?

I would fain ask you another question, very foreign to any
thing I have been saying, but from your searches into
antiquity, you may possibly, Sir, be able to explain what
nobody whom I have consulted hitherto can unravel.  At the end
of the second part of the p. 105, in the folio edition, is a
letter from Henry VIII. to the Cardinal Cibo, dated from our
palace, Mindas, 10th July, 1527.  In no map, topographical
account, or book of antiquity, can I possibly find such house
or place as Mindas.(928)

(928) See this corrected as a typographical mistake, post, p.
455.-C.



440 Letter 277
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Aug. 12, 1758.

It is not a thousand years since I wrote to you, is it?--nay,
if it is, blame the King of Prussia, who has been firing away
his time at Olmutz; blame Admiral Howe, who never said a word
of having taken Cherbourg till yesterday.--Taken Cherbourg!--
yes, he has--he landed within six miles of it on the 6th, saw
some force, who only stayed to run away; attacked a fort, a
magazine blew up, the Guards marched against a body of French,
who again made fools of them, pretending to stand, and then ran
away--and then, and then, why, then we took Cherbourg.  We
pretended to destroy the works. and a basin that has just cost
two millions.  We have not lost twenty men.  The City of
London, I suppose, is drinking brave Admiral Howe's and brave
Cherbourg's health; but I miss all these festivities by going
into Warwickshire tomorrow to Lord Hertford.  In short,
Cherbourg comes very opportunely: we had begun to grow peevish
at Louisbourg not being arrived, and there are some(929) people
at least as peevish that Prince de Soubize has again walked
into Hanover after having demolished the Hessians.  Prince
Ferdinand, who a fortnight ago was as great a hero as if he had
been born in Thames Street, is kept in check by Monsieur de
Contades, and there are some little apprehensions that our
Blues, etc., will not be able to join him.  Cherbourg will set
all to rights; the King of Prussia may fumble as much as he
pleases, and though the French should not be frightened out of
their senses at the loss of this town, we shall be fully
persuaded they are, and not a gallon less of punch will be
drunk from Westminster to Wapping.

I have received your two letters of July 1st and 7th, with the
prices of Stosch's medals, and the history of the new
pontificate.  I will not meddle with the former, content with
and thanking you much for those you send me; and for the case
of liqueurs, which I don't intend to present myself with, but
to pay you for.

You must, I think, take up with this scrap of a letter;
consider it contains a conquest.  If I wrote any longer, before
I could finish my letter, perhaps I should hear that our fleet
was come back again, and, though I should be glad they were
returned safely, it diminishes the lustre of a victory to have
a tame conclusion to it-without that, you are left at liberty
to indulge vision--Cherbourg is in France, Havre and St. Maloes
may catch the panic, Calais my be surprised, that may be
followed by a battle which we may gain; it is but a march of a
few days to Paris, the King flies to his good allies the Dutch
for safety, Prince Edward takes possession of the Bastile in
his brother's name, to whom the King, content with England and
Hanover--alas! I had forgot that he has just lost the
latter.-Good night!

Sunday morning.

Mr.  Conway, who is just come in to carry me away, brings an
account of an important advantage gained by a detachment of six
battalions of Hanoverians, who have demolished fourteen of the
French, and thereby secured the magazines and a junction with
the English.

(929) The King.



441 Letter 278
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Aug. 20, 1758.

After some silence, one might take the opportunity of
Cherbourg(930) and Louisbourg(931) to revive a little
correspondence with popular topics; but I think you are no
violent politician, and I am full as little so; I will
therefore tell you of what I of course care more, and I am
willing to presume you do too; that is, myself.  I have been
journeying much since I heard from you; first to the Vine,
where I was greatly pleased with the alterations; the garden is
quite beautified and the house dignified.  We went over to the
Grange, that sweet house of my Lord Keeper's(932) that you saw
too.  The pictures are very good, and I was particularly
pleased with the procession, which you were told was by Rubens,
but is certainly Vandyke's sketch for part of that great work,
that he was to have executed in the Banqueting-house.  You did
not tell me of a very fine Holbein, a woman, who was evidently
some princess of the White Rose.

I am just now returned from Ragley, which has had a great deal
done to it since I was there last.  Browne(933) has improved
both the ground and the water, though not quite to perfection.
This is the case of the house: where there are no striking
faults, but it wants a few Chute or Bentley touches.  I have
recommended some dignifying of the saloon with Seymours and
Fitzroys, Henry the Eighths and Charles the Seconds.  They will
correspond well to the proudest situation imaginable.  I have
already dragged some ancestors out of the dust there, written
their names on their portraits; besides which, I have found and
brought up to have repaired an incomparable picture of Van
Helmont by Sir Peter Lely.--But now for recoveries---think what
I have in part recovered! Only the state papers, private
letters, etc., etc., of the two Lords Conway,(934) secretaries
of state.  How you will rejoice and how you will grieve!  They
seem to have laid up every scrap of paper they ever had. from
the middle of Queen Elizabeth's reign to the middle of Charles
the Second's.  By the accounts of the family there were whole
rooms full; all which, during the absence of the last and the
minority of the present lord, were by the ignorance of a
steward consigned to the oven and the uses of the house.  What
remained, except one box that was kept till almost rotten in a
cupboard, were thrown loose into the lumber room; where, spread
on the pavement, they supported old marbles and screens and
boxes.  From thence I have dragged all I could, and, have
literally, taking all together, brought away a chest near five
feet long, three wide, and two deep, brim full.  Half are
bills, another part rotten, another gnawed by rats; yet I have
already found enough to repay my trouble and curiosity, not
enough to satisfy it.  I will only tell you of three letters of
the great Strafford and three long ones of news of Mr. Gerrard,
master of the Charter-house; all six written on paper edged
with green, like modern French paper.  There are handwritings
of every body, all their seals perfect, and the ribands with
which they tied their letters.  The original proclamations of
Charles the First, signed by the privy council; a letter to
King James from his son-in-law of Bohemia, with his seal; and
many, very many letters of negotiation from the Earl of Bristol
in Spain, Sir Dudley Carleton, Lord Chichester, and Sir Thomas
Roe.--What say you? will not here be food for the press?

I have picked up a little painted glass too, and have got a
promise of some old statues, lately dug up, which formerly
adorned the cathedral of Litchfield.  You see I continue to
labour in my vocation, of which I can give you a comical
instance:--I remembered a rose in painted glass in a little
village going to Ragley, which I remarked passing by five years
ago; told Mr. Conway on which hand it would b, and found it in
the very spot. I saw a very good and perfect tomb at Alcester
of Sir Fulke Greville's father and mother, and a wretched old
house with a very handsome gateway of stone at Colton,
belonging to Sir Robert Throckmorton.  There is nothing else
tolerable but twenty-two coats of the matches of the family in
painted glass.--You cannot imagine how astonished a Mr.
Seward,(935) a learned clergyman, was, who came to Ragley while
I was there.  Strolling about the house, he saw me first
sitting on the pavement of the lumber room with Louis, all over
cobwebs and dust and mortar; then found me in his own room on a
ladder writing on a picture; and half an hour afterwards lying
on the grass in the court with the dogs and the children, in my
slippers and without my hat.  He had had some doubt whether I
was the painter or the factotum of the family; but you would
have died at his surprise when he saw me walk into dinner
dressed and sit by Lady Hertford.  Lord Lyttelton was there,
and the conversation turned on literature: finding me not quite
ignorant added to the parson's wonder; but he could not contain
himself any longer, when after dinner he saw me go to romps and
jumping with the two boys; he broke out to my Lady Hertford,
and begged to know who and what sort of man I really was, for
he had never met with any thing of the kind.  Adieu!

443 Letter 279
To John Chute, Esq.(936)
Arlington Street, August 22, 1758.

By my ramble into Warwickshire I am so behindhand in politics,
that I don't know where to begin to tell you any news, and
which by this time would not be news to you.  My table is
covered with gazettes, victories and defeats which have come in
such a lump, that I am not quite sure whether it is Prince
Ferdinand or Prince Boscawen that has taken Louisbourg, nor
whether it is the late Lord Howe or the present that is killed
at Cherbourg.  I am returning to Strawberry, and shall make Mr.
M`untz's German and military sang-froid set the map in my head
to rights.

I saw my Lord Lyttelton and Miller at Ragley; the latter put me
out of all patience.  As he has heard me talked of lately, he
thought it not below him to consult me on ornaments for my
lord's house. I, who know nothing but what I have purloined
from Mr. Bentley and you, and who have not forgotten how little
they tasted your real taste and charming plan, was rather
lost.--To my comfort, I have seen the plan of their hall; it is
stolen from Houghton, and mangled frightfully: and both their
eating-room and salon are to be stucco, with pictures.

I have not time or paper to give you a full account of' a vast
treasure that I have discovered at Lord Hertford's, and brought
away with me.  If I were but so lucky as to be thirty years
older, i might have been much luckier.  In short, I have got
the remains of vast quantities of letters and state papers of
the two Lords Conway, secretaries of state--forty times as many
have been using for the oven and the house, by sentence of a
steward during my lord's minority.  Most of what I have got are
gnawed by rats, rotten, or not worth a straw: and yet I shall
save some volumes of what is very curious and valuable--three
letters of Mr. Gerrard, of the Charter-house, some of Lord
Strafford, and two of old Lennox, the Duchess, etc., etc.  In
short, if I can but continue to live thirty years
extraordinary, in lieu of those I have missed, I shall be able
to give to the world some treasures from the press at
Strawberry.  Do tell me a little of your motions, and good
night.

444 Letter 280
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Aug. 24, 1758.

You must go into laurels, you must go into mourning. our
expedition has taken Cherbourg shamefully--I mean the French
lost it shamefully--and then stood looking on while we
destroyed all their works, particularly a basin that had cost
vast sums.  But, to balance their awkwardness with ours, it
proved to be an open place, which we might have taken when we
were before it a month ago.  The fleet is now off Portland,
expecting orders for landing or proceeding.  Prince Edward gave
the ladies a ball, and told them he was too young to know what
was good-breeding in France, he would therefore behave as he
should if meaning to please in England--and kissed them all.
Our next and greatest triumph is the taking of Cape Breton, the
account of which came on Friday.  The French have not improved
like their wines by crossing the sea; but lost their spirit at
Louisbourg as much as on their own coast.  The success,
especially, in the destruction of their fleet, is very great:
the triumphs not at all disproportioned to the conquest, of
which you will see all the particulars in the Gazette.  Now for
the chapter of cypresses.  The attempt on Crown-point has
failed; Lord Howe(937) was killed in a skirmish; and two days
afterwards by blunders, rashness, and bad intelligence, we
received a great blow at Ticonderoga.  There is a Gazette, too,
with all the history of this.  My hope is that Cape Breton may
buy us Minorca and a peace, I have great satisfaction in
Captain Hervey's gallantry; not only he is my friend, but I
have the greatest regard for and obligations to my Lady Hervey;
he is her favourite son and she is particularly happy.

Mr. Wills is arrived and has sent me the medals, for which I
give you a million of thanks; the scarce ones are not only
valuable for the curiosity of them, but for their preservation.
I laughed heartily at the Duke of Argyll, and am particularly
pleased with the Jesus Rex noster.(938)

Chevert, the best and most sensible of the French officers, has
been beat by a much smaller number under the command of Imhoff,
who, I am told, would be very stupid, if a German could be so.
I think they hope a little still for Hanover, from this
success.  Of the King of Prussia--not a word.

My lady Bath has had a paralytic stroke, which drew her mouth
aside and took away her speech.  I never heard a greater
instance of cool sense; she made sign for a pen and ink, and
wrote Palsy.  They got immediate assistance, and she is
recovered.

As I wrote to you but a minute ago, I boldly conclude this
already.  Adieu!

(937) General George Augustus, third Viscount Howe.  He was
succeeded in the title by his brother Richard, the celebrated
admiral.  Mr. George Grenville, in a letter to Mr. Pitt, of the
28th, pays the following tribute to his memory:-"I admired his
virtuous, gallant character, and lament his loss accordingly: I
cannot help thinking it peculiarly unfortunate for his country
and his friends, that he should fall in the first action of
this war, before his spirit and his example, and the success
and glory which, in all human probability, would have attended
them, had produced their full effect on our troops, and those
of the enemy." Chatham Correspondence, vol. i. p. 339.-E.

445 Letter 281
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 2, 1758.

It is well I have got something to pay you for the best letter
that ever was!  A vast victory, I own, does not entertain me so
much as a good letter; but you are bound to like any thing
military better than your own wit, and therefore I hope you
will think a defeat of the Russians a better bon-mot than any
you sent me.  Should you think it clever if the King of Prussia
has beaten them? How much cleverer if he has taken three
lieutenant-generals and an hundred pieces of cannon?  How much
cleverer still, if he has left fifteen thousand Muscovites dead
on the Spot?(939)  Does the loss of only three thousand of his
own men take off from or sharpen the sting of this joke?  In
short, all this is fact, as a courier arrived at Sion Hill this
morning affirms.  The city, I suppose, expect that his Majesty
will now be"at leisure to step to Ticonderoga and repair our
mishaps.(940)  But I shall talk no more politics; if this finds
you at Chatworth, as I suppose it will, you will be better
informed than from me.

lady Mary Coke arrived at Ragley between two and three in the
morning; how unlucky that I was not there to offer her part of
an aired bed! But how could you think of the proposal you have
made me?  Am not I already in love with "the youngest,
handsomest, and wittiest widow in England?"  As Herculean a
labourer as I am, as Tom Hervey says, I don't choose another.
I am still in the height of my impatience for the chest of old
papers from Ragley, which, either by the fault of their
servants, or of the wagoner, is not yet arrived.  I shall go to
London again on Monday in quest of it; and in truth think so
much of it, that, when I first heard of the victory this
morning, I rejoiced, as we were likely now to recover the
Palatinate.  Good night!

(939) The defeat of the Russians at Zorndorf.


(940) The repulse of General Abercrombie at Ticonderoga.



446 Letter 282
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 9, 1758.

Well! the King of Prussia is found again--where do you think?
only in Poland, up to the chin in Russians!  Was ever such a
man!  He was riding home from Olmutz; they ran and told him of
an army of Muscovites,(941) as you would of a covey of
partridges; he galloped thither, and shot them.  But what news
I am telling you!  I forgot that all ours comes by
water-carriage, and that you must know every thing a fortnight
before us.  It is incredible how popular he is here; except a
few, who take him for the same person as Mr. Pitt, the lowest
of the people are perfectly acquainted with him: as I was
walking by the river the other night, a bargeman asked me for
something to drink the King of Prussia's health.  Yet Mr. Pitt
specifies his own glory as much as he can: the standards taken
at Louisbourg have been carried to St. Paul's with much parade;
and this week, after bringing it by land from Portsmouth, they
have dragged the cannon of Cherbourg into Hyde Park, on
pretence of diverting a man,(942) whom, in former days, I
believe, Mr. Pitt has laughed for loving such rattles as drums
and trumpets.  Our expedition, since breaking a basin at
Cherbourg, has done nothing, but are dodging about still.
Prince Edward gave one hundred guineas to the poor of
Cherbourg, and the General and Admiral twenty-five apiece.  I
love charity, but sure is this excess of it, to lay out
thousands, and venture so many lives, for the opportunity of
giving a Christmas-box to your enemies!  Instead of beacons, I
suppose, the coast of France will be hung with pewter-pots with
a slit in them, as prisons are, to receive our alms.

Don't trouble yourself about the Pope: I am content to find
that he will by no means eclipse my friend.  You please me with
telling me of a collection of medals bought for the Prince of
Wales.  I hope it Is his own taste; if it is only thought right
that he should have it, I am glad.

I am again got into the hands of builders, though this time to
a very small extent; only the addition of a little cloister and
bedchamber.  A day may come that will produce a gallery, a
round tower, a large cloister, and a cabinet, in the manner of
a little chapel: but I am too poor for these ambitious designs
yet, and I have so many ways of dispersing My Money, that I
don't know when I shall be richer.  However, I amuse myself
infinitely; besides my printing-house, which is constantly at
work, besides such a treasure of taste and drawing as my friend
Mr. Bentley, I have a painter in the house, who is an engraver
too, a mechanic, an every thing.  He was a Swiss engineer in
the French service; but his regiment being broken at the peace,
Mr. Bentley found him in the Isle of Jersey and fixed him with
me.  He has an astonishing genius for landscape, and added to
that, all the industry and patience of a German.  We are just
now practising, and have succeeded surprisingly in a new method
of painting, discovered at Paris by Count Caylus, and intended
to be the encaustic method of the ancients.  My Swiss has
painted, I am writing the account,(943) and my press is to
notify our improvements.  As you will know that way, I will not
tell you here at large.  In short, to finish all the works I
have in hand, and all the schemes I have in my head, I cannot
afford to live less than fifty years more.  What pleasure it
would give me to see you here for a moment! I should think I
saw you and your dear brother at once! Can't you form some
violent secret expedition against Corsica or Port Mahon, which
may make it necessary for you to come and settle here? Are we
to correspond till we meet in some unknown world? Alas! I fear
so; my dear Sir, you are as little likely to save money as I
am--would you could afford to resign your crown and be a
subject at Strawberry Hill! Adieu!

P. S. I have forgot to tell you of a wedding in our family; my
brother's eldest daughter(944) is to be married tomorrow to
lord Albemarle's third brother, a canon of Windsor.  We are
very happy with the match.  The bride is very agreeable, and
sensible, and good; not so handsome as her sisters, but further
from ugliness than beauty.  It is the second, Maria,(945) who
is beauty itself! Her face, bloom, eyes, hair, teeth, and
person are all perfect.  You may imagine how charming she is,
when her only fault, if one must find one, is, that her face is
rather too round.  She has a great deal of wit and vivacity,
with perfect modesty.  I must tell you too of their
brother:(946) he was on the expedition to St. Maloes; a party
of fifty men appearing on a hill, he was despatched to
reconnoitre with only eight men.  Being stopped by a brook, he
prepared to leap it; an old sergeant dissuaded him, from the
inequality of the numbers. "Oh!" said the boy, "I will tell you
what; our profession is bred up to so much regularity that any
novelty terrifies them--with our light English horses we will
leap this stream; and I'll be d--d if they don't run."  He did
so, and they did so.  However, he was not content; but insisted
that each of his party should carry back a prisoner before
them.  They got eight, when they overtook an elderly man, to
whom they offered quarter, bidding him lay down his arms.  He
replied, "they were English, the enemies of his King and
country; that he hated them, and had rather be killed."  My
nephew hesitated a minute, and said, "I see you are a brave
fellow, and don't fear death, but very likely you fear a
beating-if you don't lay down your arms this instant, my men
shall drub you as long as they can stand over you."  The fellow
directly flung down his arms in a passion.  The Duke of
Marlborough sent my brother word of this, adding, it was the
only clever action in their whole exploit.  Indeed I am pleased
with it; for besides his spirit, I don't see, with this thought
and presence of mind, why he should not make a general.  I
return to one little word of the King of Prussia-- shall I tell
you? I fear all this time he is only fattening himself with
glory for Marshal Daun, who will demolish him at last, and
then, for such service, be shut up in some fortress or in the
inquisition--for it is impossible but the house of Austria must
indemnify themselves for so many mortifications by some horrid
ingratitude!

(941) This was the battle of Zorndorf, fought on the @5th of
August, 1758, and gained by the King of Prussia over the
Russians, commanded by Count Fermor.-D.

(942) The King.

448 Letter 283
To The Rev. Henry Zouch.
Strawberry Hill, September 14, 1758.

Sir,
Though the approaching edition of my Catalogue is so far
advanced that little part is left now for any alteration, yet
as a book of that kind is always likely to be reprinted from
the new persons who grow entitled to a place in it, and as long
as it is in my power I shall wish to correct and improve it, I
must again thank you, Sir, for the additional trouble you have
given yourself.  The very first article strikes me much.  May I
ask where, and in what page of what book, I can find Sir R.
Cotton's account of Richard II.(947) being an author: does not
he mean Richard I.?

The Basilicon Doron is published in the folio of K. James's
works, and contains instructions to his son, Prince Henry.  In
return, I will ask you where you find those verses of Herbert;
and I would also ask you, how you have had time to find and
know so much?

Lord Leicester, and much less the Duke of Monmouth, will
scarce, I fear, come under the description I have laid down to
myself of authors.  I doubt the first did not compose his own
Apology.

Did the Earl of Bath publish, or only design to publish,
Dionysius?(948)  Shall I find the account in Usher's Letters?
Since you are so very kind, Sir, as to favour me with your
assistance, shall I beg, Sir, to prevent my repeating trouble
to you, just to mark at any time where you find the notices you
impart to Me; for, though the want of a citation is the effect
of my ignorance, it has the same consequence to you.

I have not the Philosophical Transactions, but I will hereafter
examine them on the hints you mention, particularly for Lord
Brounker,(949) who I did not know had written, though I have
often thought it probable he did.  As I have considered Lord
Berkeley's Love-letters, I have no doubt but they are a
fiction, though grounded on a real story.

That Lord Falkland was a writer of controversy appears by the
list of his works, and that he is said to have assisted
Chillingworth: that he wrote against Chillingworth, you see,
Sir, depends upon very vague authority; that is, upon the
assertion of an anonymous person, who wrote so above a hundred
years ago.

James, Earl of Marlborough, is entirely a new author to me--at
present, too late.  Lord Raymond I had inserted, and he will
appear in the next edition.

I have been as unlucky, for the present, about Lord Totness.
In a collection published in Ireland, called Hibernica, I
found, but too late, that he translated another very curious
piece, relating to Richard II. However, Sir, with these, and
the very valuable helps I have received from you, I shall be
able, at a proper time, to enrich another edition much.

(947) Mr. Walpole takes no notice of Richard II. as an author;
but Mr. park inserts this prince as a writer of ballads.  In a
letter to Archbishop Usher, Sir Robert Cotton requested his
grace to procure for him a poem by Richard II. which that
prelate had pointed out.-C.

(948) Spelman's is the only English translation of the
Antiquities of Dionysius Halicarnassensis, known to be
printed.-C.

(949) He wrote several papers in the Philosophical
Transactions, and also translated Descartes' Music Compendium.-

449 Letter 284
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(950)
Arlington Street, Sept. 19, 1758.

I have all my life laughed at ministers in my letters; but at
least with the decency of obliging them to break open the seal.
You have more noble frankness, and send your satires to the
post with not so much as a wafer, as my Lord Bath did sometimes
in my father's administration.  I scarce laughed more at the
inside of your letter than at the cover--not a single button to
the waistband of its beseeches, but all its nakedness fairly
laid open! what was worse, all Lady Mary Coke's nakedness was
laid open at the same time.  Is this your way of treating a
dainty widow!  What will Mr. Pitt think of all this? will he
begin to believe that you have some spirit, when, with no fear
of Dr. Shebbeare's example(951) before your eyes, you speak
your Mind so freely, without any modification? As Mr. Pitt may
be cooled a little to his senses, perhaps he may now find out,
that a grain of prudence is no bad ingredient in a mass of
courage; in short, he and the mob are at last undeceived, and
have found, by sad experience that all the cannon of France has
not been brought into Hyde Park.  An account, which you will
see in the Gazette, (though a little better disguised than your
letters,) is come that after our troops had been set on shore,
and left there, till my Lord Howe went somewhere else, and
cried Hoop! having nothing else to do for four days to amuse
themselves, nor knowing whether there was a town within a
hundred miles, went staring about the country to see whether
there were any Frenchmen left in France; which Mr. Pitt, in
very fine words, had assured them there was not, and which my
Lord Howe, in very fine silence, had confirmed.  However,
somehow or other, (Mr. Deputy Hodges says they were not French,
but Papists sent from Vienna to assist the King of France,)
twelve battalions fell upon our rear-guard, and, which General
Blighe says is "very Common," (I suppose he means that rashness
and folly should run itself' into a scrape,)--were all cut to
pieces or taken.  The town says, Prince Edward (Duke of York)
ran hard to save himself; I don't mean too fast, but scarcely
fast enough; and the General says, that Lord Frederick
Cavendish, your friend, is safe; the thing he seems to have
thought of most, except a little vain parade of his own
self-denial on his nephew.  I shall not be at all surprised if,
to show he was not in the wrong, Mr. Pitt should get ready
another expedition by the depth of winter, and send it in
search of the cannons and colours of these twelve battalions.
Pray Heaven your letter don't put it in his head to give you
the command!  It is not true, that he made the King ride upon
one of the cannons to the Tower.

I was really touched with my Lady Howe's advertisement,(952)
though I own at first it made me laugh; for seeing an address
to the voters for Nottingham signed "Charlotte Howe," I
concluded (they are so manly a family) that Mrs. Howe,(953) who
rides a fox-chase, and dines at the table d'h`ote at Grantham,
intended to stand for member of Parliament.

Sir John Armitage died on board a ship before the landing; Lady
Hardwickc's nephew, Mr. Cocks, scarce recovered of his
Cherbourg wound, is killed.' He had seven thousand pounds a
year, and was volunteer.  I don't believe his uncle and aunt
advised his venturing so much money.

My Lady Burlington is very ill, and the distemper shows itself
oddly; she breaks out all over in-curses and blasphemies.  Her
maids are afraid of catching them, and will hardly venture into
her room.

On reading over your letter again, I begin to think that the
connexion between Mr. Pitt and my dainty widow is stronger than
I imagined.  One of them must have caught of the other that
noble contempt which makes a thing's being impossible not
signify.  It sounds very well in sensible mouths; but how
terrible to be the chambermaid or the army of such people! I
really am in a panic, and having some mortal impossibilities
about me which a dainty widow might not allow to signify, I
will balance a little between her and my Lady Carlisle, who, I
believe, knows that impossibilities do signify.  These were
some of my reflections on reading your letter again; another
was, that I am now convinced you sent your letter open to the
post on purpose; you knew It was so good a letter that every
body ought to see it-and yet you would pass for a modest man!

I am glad I am not in favour enough to be consulted by my Lord
Duchess(954) on the Gothic farm; she would have given me so
many fine and unintelligible reasons why it should not be as it
should be, that I should have lost a little of my patience.
You don't tell me if the goose-board in hornbean is quite
finished; and have you forgot that I actually was in t'other
goose-board, the conjuring room?

I wish you joy on your preferment in the militia, though I do
not think it quite so safe an employment as it used to be.  If
George Townshend's disinterested virtue should grow impatient
for a regiment, he will persuade Mr. Pitt that the militia arc
the only troops in the world for taking Rochfort.  Such a
scheme would answer all his purposes - would advance his own
interest, contradict the Duke's opinion, who holds militia
cheap, and by the ridiculousness of the attempt would furnish
very good subjects to his talent of buffoonery in black-lead.

The King of Prussia you may believe is in Petersburg, but he
happens to be in Dresden.  Good night! Mine and Sir Harry
Hemlock's services to my Lady Ailesbury.

prosecuted.-E.

(952 On the news of the death of Lord Howe reaching the dowager

451 Letter 285
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Sept. 22, 1758.

The confusion of the first accounts and the unwelcomeness of
the subject, made me not impatient to despatch another letter
so quickly after my last.  However, as I suppose the French
relations will be magnified, it is proper to let you know the
exact truth.  Not being content with doing nothing at St.
Maloes, and with being suffered to do all we could at
Cherbourg, (no great matter,) our land and sea heroes, Mr. Pitt
and Lord Howe, projected a third--I don't know what to call it.
It seems they designed to take St. Maloes, but being
disappointed by the weather, they--what do you think? landed
fifteen miles from it, with no object nor near any--and lest
that should not be absurd enough, the fleet sailed away for
another bay, leaving the army with only two cannons. to
scramble to them across the country as they could.  Nine days
they were staring about France; at last they had notice of
twelve battalions approaching, on which they stayed a little
before they hurried to the transports.  The French followed
them at a distance, firing from the upper grounds.  When the
greatest part were reimbarked, the French descended and fell on
the rear, on which it Was necessary to sacrifice the Guards to
secure the rest.  Those brave young men did wonders--that is,
they were cut to pieces with great intrepidity.  We lost
General Dury and ten other officers; Lord Frederick Cavendish
with twenty-three others were taken prisoners.  In all we have
lost seven hundred men, but more shamefully for the projectors
and conductors than can be imagined, for no shadow of an excuse
can be offered for leaving them so exposed with no purpose or
possible advantage, in the heart of an Enemy's country.  What
heightens the distress. the army sailed from Weymouth with a
full persuasion that they were to be sacrificed to the
vainglorious whims of a man of words(955) and a man(956) of
none!

themselves with their darling Prussian; he has strode back over
20 or 30,000 Russians,(957) and stepped into Dresden.  They
even say that Daun is retired.  For my part, it is to inform
you, that I dwell at all on these things.  I am shocked with
the iniquities I see and have seen.  I abhor their dealings.

Both Kings and Ministers of State!"

I don't know whether I can attain any goodness by shunning

advertise my detestation, for if I professed virtue, I should
expect to be suspected of designing to be a minister.  Adieu!
you are good, and wilt keep yourself so.

I had sealed my letter, but as it cannot go away till
to-morrow, I open it again on receiving yours of Sept. 9th.  I
don't understand Marshal Botta's being so well satisfied with
our taking Louisbourg.  Are the Austrians disgusted with the
French?  Do they begin to repent their alliance? or has he so
much sense as to know what improper allies they have got? It is
very right in you who are a minister, to combat hostile
Ministers--had I been at Florence, I should not have so much
contested the authority of the Abb`e de Ville's performance: I
have no more doubt of' the convention of Closter-Severn having
been scandalously broken, than it was shamelessly disavowed by
those who commanded it.

In our loss are included some of our volunteers; a Sir John
Armitage, a young man of fortune, just come much into the
world, and engaged to the sister(958) of the hot-headed and
cool-tongued Lord Howe; a Mr. Cocks, nephew of lady Hardwicke,
who could not content himself with seven thousand pounds
a-year, without the addition of an ensign's commission - he was
not quite recovered of a wound he had got at CHerbourg.  The
royal volunteer, Prince Edward, behaved with much spirit.
Adieu!

453 Letter 286
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Oct. 3, 1758.

having no news to send you, but the massacre of St. Cas,(959)
not agreeable enough for a letter, I stayed till I had
something to send you, and behold a book! I have delivered to
portly old Richard, your ancient nurse, the new produce of the
Strawberry press.  You know that the wife of Bath is gone to
maunder at St. Peter, and before he could hobble to the gate,
my Lady Burlington, cursing and blaspheming, overtook t'other
Countess, and both together made such an uproar, that the cock
flew up into the tree of life for safety, and St. Peter himself
turned the key and hid himself; and as nobody could get into
t'other world, half the Guards are come back again, and
appeared in the park to-day, but such dismal ghostly figures,
that my Lady Townshend was really frightened, and is again
likely to turn Methodist.

Do you design, or do you not, to look at Strawberry as you come
to town? if you do.  I will send a card to my neighbour, Mrs.
Holman, to meet you any day five weeks that you please--or I
can amuse you without cards; such fat bits of your dear dad,
old Jemmy, as I have found among the Conway papers, such
morsels of all sorts!  but come and see.  Adieu!

454 Letter 287
To The Rev. Henry Zouch.
Strawberry Hill, October 5th, 1758.

Sir,
You make so many apologies for conferring great favours on me,
that if you have not a care.  I shall find it more convenient
to believe that, instead of being grateful, I shall be very
good if I am forgiving.  If I am impertinent enough to take up
this style, at least I promise you I will be very good, and I
will certainly pardon as many obligations as you shall please
to lay on me.

I have that Life of Richard II.  It is a poor thing, and not
even called in the title-page Lord Holles's; it is a still
lower trick of booksellers to insert names of authors in a
catalogue, which, with all their confidence, they do not
venture to bestow on the books themselves; I have found several
instances of this.

Lord Preston's Boetius I have.  From Scotland, I have received
a large account of Lord Cromerty, which will appear in my next
edition: as my copy is in the press, I do not exactly remember
if there is the Tract on Precedency: he wrote a great number of
things, and was held it) great contempt living and dead.(960)

I have long sought, and wished to find, some piece of Duke
Humphrey:(961) he was a great patron of learning, built the
schools, I think, and gave a library to Oxford.  Yet, I fear, I
may not take the authority of Pits, who is a wretched liar; nor
is it at all credible that in so blind an age a Prince, who,
with all his love of learning, I fear, had very little of
either learning or parts, should write on Astronomy;--had it
been on Astrology, it might have staggered me.

My omission of Lord Halifax's maxims was a very careless one,
and has been rectified.  I did examine the Musae Anglicaanae,
and I think found a copy or two, and at first fancied I had
found more, till I came to examine narrowly.  In the Joys and
Griefs of Oxford and Cambridge, are certainly many noble
copies; but you judge very right, Sir--they are not to be
mentioned, no more than exercises at school, where, somehow or
other, every peer has been a poet.  To my shame, you are still
more in the right about the Duke of Buckingham: if you will
give me leave, instead of thinking that he Wrote, hoping to be
mistaken for his predecessor, I will believe that he hoped so
after he had written.

You are again in the right, Sir, about Lord Abercorn, as the
present lord himself informed me.  I don't know Lord
Godolphin's verses: at most, by your account, he should be in
the Appendix; but if they are only signed Sidney Godolphin,
they may belong to his uncle, who, if I remember rightly, was
one of the troop of verse-writers of that time.

You have quite persuaded me of the mistake in Mindas; till you
mentioned it, I had forgot that they wrote Windsor "Windesore,"
and then by abbreviation the mistake was easy.

The account of Lord Clarendon is printed off; I do mention as
printed his account of Ireland, though I knew nothing of
Borlase.  Apropos, Sir, are you not glad to see that the second
part of his history is actually advertised to come out soon
after Christmas?(962)

Lord Nottingham's letter I shall certainly mention.

I yesterday sent to Mr. Whiston a little piece that I have just
mentioned here, and desired him to convey it to you; you must
not expect a great deal from it: yet it belongs so much to my
Catalogue, that I thought it a duty to publish it.  A better
return to some of your civilities is to inform you of Dr.
Jortin's Life of Erasmus, with which I am much entertained.
There are numberless anecdotes of men thought great in their
day, now as much forgotten, that it grows valuable again to
hear about them.  The book is written with great moderation and
goodness of heart: the style is not very striking, and has some
vulgarisms, and In a work of that bulk I should rather have
taken more pains to digest and connect it into a flowing
narrative, than drily give it as a diary: yet I dare promise it
will amuse you much.

With your curiosity, Sir, and love of information, I am sure
you will be glad to hear of a most valuable treasure that I
have discovered; it is the collection of state papers,(963)
amassed by the two Lords Conway, that were secretaries of
state, and their family: vast numbers have been destroyed; yet
I came time enough to retrieve vast numbers, many, indeed, in a
deplorable condition.  They were buried under lumber' upon the
pavement of an unfinished chapel, at Lord Hertford's in
Warwickshire, and during his minority, and the absence of his
father, an ignorant steward delivered them over to the oven and
kitchen, and yet had not been able to destroy them all.  It is
a vast work to dry, range, and read them, and to burn the
useless, as bills, bonds, and every other kind of piece of
paper that ever came into a house, and were all jumbled and
matted together.  I propose, by degrees, to print the most
curious; of which, I think, I have already selected enough to
form two little volumes of the size of my Catalogue.  Yet I
will not give too great expectations about them, because I know
how often the public has been disappointed when they came to
see in print what in manuscript has appeared to the editor
wonderfully choice.

(960) We can hardly account for this expression, unless Mr.
Walpole alludes to Lord Cromerty's political reputation.  Macky
states, that " his arbitrary proceedings had rendered him so
obnoxious to the people, he could not be employed;" and,
certainly, his character for consistency and integrity was not
very exalted: but almost all contemporary writers describe him
as a man of great weight and of singular endowments; and
Walpole himself, in his subsequent editions, calls him "a
person eminent for his learning, and for his abilities as a
statesman and general."-C.

(961) That Duke Humphrey had at least a relish for learning,
may be inferred from the following passage.  At the close of a
fine manuscript in the Cotton collection (Nero E. v.) is "Origo
et processus gentis Scotorum, ae de superioritate Regum Angliae
super regnum illud."  It once belonged to Humphrey Duke of
Gloucester, and has this Sentence in his own handwriting at the
end, "Cest livre est `a moy Homfrey Duc de Gloucestre, lequel
j'achetay des executeurs de maistre Thomas Polton, feu evesque
de Wurcestre."  Bishop Polton died in 1436.-C.

(962) The second part of Lord Clarendon's history was printed
in folio, in 1760, and also in three volumes octavo.-C.

(963) The increased and increasing taste of the public for the
materials of history, such as these valuable papers supply,
will, we have reason to hope, be gratified by the approaching
appearance of this collection, publication of which was, we
see, contemplated even as long since as 1758.-C.



456 Letter 288
To The Right Hon. Lady Hervey.
Arlington Street, Oct. 17, 1758.

Your ladyship, I hope, will not think that such a strange thing
as my own picture seems of consequence enough to me to write a
letter about it: but obeying your commands does seem so; lest
you should return and think I had neglected it, I must say that
I have come to town three several times on purpose, but Mr.
Ramsay (I will forgive him) has been constantly Out of town.
So much for that.

I would have sent you word that the King of Portugal coming
along the road at midnight, which was in his own room at noon,
his foot slipped, and three balls went through his body; which,
however, had no other consequence than giving him a stroke of a
palsy, of which he is quite recovered, except being dead.(964)
Some, indeed, are so malicious as to say, that the Jesuits, who
are the most conscientious men in the world, murdered him,
because he had an intrigue with another man's wife: but all
these histories I supposed your ladyship knew better than me,
as, till I came to town yesterday, I imagined you was returned.
For my own part, about whom you are sometimes so good as to
interest yourself, I am as well as can be expected after the
murder of a king and the death of a person of the next
consequence to a king, the master of the ceremonies, poor Sir
Clement,(965) who is supposed to have been suffocated by my
Lady Macclesfield's(966) kissing hands.

This will be a melancholy letter, for I have nothing to tell
your ladyship but tragical stories.  Poor Dr. Shawe(967) being
sent for in great haste to Claremont--(It seems the Duchess had
caught a violent cold by a hair of her own whisker getting up
her nose and making her sneeze)--the poor Doctor, I say, having
eaten a few mushrooms before he set out, was taken so ill, that
he was forced to stop at Kingston; and, being carried to the
first apothecary's, prescribed a medicine for himself which
immediately cured him.  This catastrophe so alarmed the Duke of
Newcastle, that he immediately ordered all the mushroom beds to
be destroyed, and even the toadstools in the park did not
escape scalping in this general massacre.  What I tell you is
literally true.  Mr. Stanley, who dined there last Sunday, and
is not partial against that court, heard the edict repeated,
and confirmed it to me last night.  And a voice of lamentation
was heard at Ramah in Claremont, Chlo`e(968) weeping for her
mushrooms, and they are not!

After all these important histories, I would try to make you
smile, If I was not afraid you would resent a little freedom
taken with a great name.  May I venture?

"Why Taylor the quack calls himself Chevalier,
'Tis not easy a reason to render;
Unless blinding eyes, that he thinks to make clear,
Demonstrates he's but a Pretender.

A book has been left at your ladyship's house; it is Lord
Whitworth's Account of Russia.(969)  Monsieur Kniphausen has
promised me some curious anecdotes of the Czarina Catherine-so
my shop is likely to flourish.  I am your ladyship's most
obedient servant.

the correct account:--As the King was taking The air in his

was attacked in a solitary lane near Belem by three men, one of
whom discharged his carbine at the coachman, and wounded him
dangerously; the other two fired their blunderbusses at the
King, loaded with pieces of iron, and wounded him in the face
and several parts of his body, but chiefly in the right arm,
which disabled him for a long time.

in 1725, the title became extinct.-E.



457 Letter 289
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(970)
Arlington Street, Oct. 17, 1758.

I have read your letter, as you may believe, with the strictest
attention, and will tell you my thoughts as sincerely as you do
and have a right to expect them.

In the first place, I think you far from being under any
obligation for this notice.  If Mr. Pitt is sensible that he
has used you very ill, is it the part of an honest man to
require new submissions, new supplications from the person he
has injured?  If he thinks you proper to command, as one must
suppose by this information, is it patriotism that forbids him
to employ an able officer, unless that officer sues to be
employed?  Does patriotism bid him send out a man that has had
a stroke of a palsy, preferable to a young man of vigour and
capacity, only because the latter has made' no Application
within these two months!--But as easily as I am inclined to
believe that your merit makes its way even through the cloud of
Mr. Pitt's proud prejudices, yet I own in the present case I
question it.  I can see two reasons why he should wish to
entice you to this application: the first is, the clamour
against his giving all commands to young or improper officers
is extreme; Holmes, appointed admiral of the blue but six weeks
ago, has writ a warm letter on the chapter of subaltern
commanders: the second, and possibly connected in his mind with
the former, may be this; he would like to refuse you, and then
say, you had asked when it was too late; and at the same time
would have to say that he would have employed you if you had
asked sooner.  This leads me to the point of time: Hobson is
not Only appointed,(971) but Haldane, though going governor to
Jamaica, is made a brigadier and joined to him,--Colonel
Barrington set out to Portsmouth last night.  All these
reasons, I think, make it very improper for you to ask this
command now.  You have done more than enough to satisfy your
honour, and will certainly have opportunities again of
repeating offers of your service.  But though it may be right
to ask in general to serve, I question much if it is advisable
to petition for particulars, any failure in which would be
charged entirely on you.  I should wish to have you vindicated
by the rashness of Mr. Pitt and the miscarriages of others, as
I think they hurry to -make you be; but while he bestows only
impracticable commands, knowing that, if there is blood enough
shed, the city of London will be content even with
disappointments, I hope you will not be sacrificed either to
the mob or the minister.  And this leads me to the article of
the expedition itself.  Martinico is the general notion; a
place the strongest in the world, with a garrison of ten
thousand men.  Others now talk of Guadaloupe, almost as strong
and of much less consequence.  Of both, every body that knows,
despairs.  It is almost impossible for me to find out the real
destination.' I avoid every one of the three factions--and
though I might possibly learn the secret from the chief of one
of them, if he knows it, yet I own I do not care to try; I
don't think it fair to thrust myself into secrets with a man
(972) of whose ambition and views I do not think well, and
whose purposes (in those lights) I have declined and will
decline to serve.  Besides, I have reason just now to think
that he and his court are meditating some attempt which may
throw us again into confusion; and I had rather not be told
what I am sure I shall not approve: besides, I cannot ask
secrets of this nature without hearing more with which I would
not be trusted, and which, if divulged, would be imputed to me.
I know you will excuse me for these reasons, especially as you
know how much I would do to serve you, and would even in this
case, if I was not convinced that it is too late for you to
apply; and being too late, they would be glad to say you had
asked too late.  Besides if any information could be got from
the channel at which I have hinted, the Duke of Richmond could
get it better than I; and the Duke of Devonshire could give it
you without.

I can have no opinion of the expedition itself, which certainly
started from the disappointment at St. Cas, if it can be called
a disappointment where there was no object.  I have still more
doubts on Lord Milton's authority; Clarke(973) was talked to by
the Princess yesterday much more than any body in the room.
Cunningham is made quartermaster-general to this equipment;
these things don't look as if your interest was increased.  As
Lord George has sent over his commands for Cunningham, might
not his art at the same time have suggested some application to
you--tell me, do you think he would ask this command for
himself I, who am not of so honest and sincere a nature as you
are, suspect that this hint is sent to you with some bad view-I
don't mean on Lord Milton's part, who I dare say is deceived by
his readiness to serve you; and since you do me the honour of
letting me at all judge for you, which in one light I think I
am fit to do, I mean, as your spirit naturally makes you
overlook every thing to get employed, I would wish you to
answer to Lord Milton,,"that you should desire of all things to
have had this command, but that having been discouraged from
asking what you could not flatter yourself would be granted, it
would look, you think, a vain offer, to sue for what is now
given away, and would not be consistent with your honour to ask
when it is too late."  I hint this, as such an answer would
turn their arts on themselves, if, as I believe, they mean to
refuse you, and to reproach you with asking too late.

If the time is come for Mr. Pitt to want you, you will not long
be unemployed; if it is not, then you would get nothing by
asking.  Consider, too, how much more graceful a reparation of
your honour it will be, to have them forced to recall you, than
to force yourself on desperate service, as if you yourself, not
they, had injured your reputation.

I can say nothing now on any other chapter, this has so much
engrossed all my thoughts.  I see no one reason upon earth for
your asking now.  If you ever should ask again, you will not
want opportunities; and the next time you ask, will have just
the same merit that this could have, and by asking in time,
would be liable to none of the objections of that sort which I
have mentioned! Adieu!  Timeo Lord George et dona.

459 Letter 290
To The Rev. Henry Zouch.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 21st, 1758.

Sir,
Every letter I receive from you is a new obligation, bringing
me new information; but, sure, my Catalogue was not worthy of
giving you so much trouble.  Lord Fortescue is quite new to me:
I have sent him to the press.  Lord Dorset's poem it will be
unnecessary to mention separately, as I have already said that
his works are to be found among those of the minor poets.

I don't wonder, Sir, that you prefer Lord Clarendon to
Polybius; nor can two authors well be more unlike: the
former(974) wrote a general history in a most obscure and
almost unintelligible style; the latter-, a portion of private
history, in the noblest style in the world.  Whoever made the
comparison, I will do them the justice to believe that they
understood bad Greek better than their own language in its
elevation.

For Dr. Jortin's Erasmus, which I have very nearly finished, it
has given me a good opinion of the author, and he has given me
a very bad one of his subject.  By the Doctor's labour and
impartiality, Erasmus appears a begging parasite, who had parts
enough to discover truth, and not courage enough to profess it:
whose vanity made him always writing; yet Ills writings ought
to have cured his vanity, as they were the most abject things
in the world.  Good Erasmus's honest mean was alternate
time-serving.  I never had thought much about him, and now
heartily despise him.

When I speak my opinion to you, Sir, about what I dare say you
care as little for as I do, (for what is the merit of a mere
man of letters?) it is but fit I should answer you as sincerely
on a question about which you are so good as to interest
yourself.  that my father's life is likely to be written, I
have no grounds for believing.  I mean I know nobody that
thinks of it.  For myself, I certainly shall not, for many
reasons, which you must have the patience to hear.  A reason to
me myself is, that I think too highly of him, and too meanly of
myself, to presume I am equal to the task.  They who do not
agree with me in the former part of my position, will
undoubtedly allow the latter part.  In the next place, the very
truths that I should relate would be so much imputed to
partiality, that he would lose of his due praise by the
suspicion of my prejudice.  In the next place, I was born too
late in his life to be acquainted with him in the active part
of it.  Then I was at school, at the university, abroad, and
returned not till the last moments of his administration.  What
I know of him I could only learn from his own mouth in the last
three years of his life; when, to my shame, I was so idle, and
young, and thoughtless, that I by no means profited of his
leisure as I might have done; and, indeed, I have too much
impartiality in my nature to care, if I could, to give the
world a history, collected solely from the person himself of
whom I should write. With the utmost veneration for his truth,
I can easily conceive, that a man who had lived a life of
party, and who had undergone such persecution from party,
should have had greater bias than he himself could be sensible
of.  The last, and that a reason which must be admitted, if all
the others are not--his papers are lost.  Between the confusion
of his affairs, and the indifference of my elder brother to
things of that sort, they were either lost, burnt, or what we
rather think, were stolen by a favourite servant of my brother,
who proved a great rogue, and was dismissed in my brother's
life; and the papers were not discovered to be missing till
after my brother's death.  Thus, Sir, I should want vouchers
for many things I could say of much importance.  I have another
personal reason that discourages me from attempting this task,
or any other, besides the great reluctance that I have to being
a voluminous author.  Though I am by no means the learned man
you are so good as to call me in compliment; though, on the
contrary, nothing can be more superficial than my knowledge, or
more trifling than my reading,--yet, I have so much strained my
eyes, that it is often painful to me to read even a newspaper
by daylight.  In short, Sir, having led a very dissipated life,
in all the hurry of the world of pleasures scarce ever read,
but by candlelight, after I have come home late at nights.  As
my eyes have never had the least inflammation or humour, I am
assured I may still recover them by care and repose.  I own I
prefer my eyes to any thing I could ever read, much more to any
thing I could write.  However, after all I have said, perhaps I
may now and then, by degrees, throw together some short
anecdotes of my father's private life and particular story, and
leave his public history to more proper and more able hands, if
such will undertake it.  Before I finish on this chapter, I can
assure you he did forgive my Lord Bolingbroke(975)--his nature
was forgiving: after all was over, and he had nothing to fear
or disguise, I can say with truth, that there were not three
men of whom he ever dropped a word with rancour.  What I meant
of the clergy not forgiving Lord Bolingbroke, alluded not to
his doctrines, but to the direct attack and war he made on the
whole body.  And now, Sir, I will confess my own weakness to
you.  I do not think so highly of that writer, as I seem to do
in my book; but I thought it would be imputed to prejudice in
me, if I appeared to undervalue an author of whom so many
persons of sense still think highly.  My being Sir Robert
Walpole's son warped me to praise, instead of censuring, Lord
Bolingbroke.  With regard to the Duke of Leeds, I think you
have misconstrued the decency of my expression.  I said, Burnet
had treated him severely; that is, I chose that Burnet should
say so, rather than myself.  I have never praised where my
heart condemned.  Little attentions, perhaps, to worthy
descendants, were excusable in a work of so extensive a nature,
and that approached so near to these times.  I may, perhaps,
have an opportunity at one day or other of showing you some
passages suppressed on these motives, which yet I do not intend
to destroy.

Crew, Bishop of Durham, was is abject a tool as possible.  I
would be very certain he is an author before I should think him
worth mentioning.  If ever you should touch on Lord
Willoughby's sermon, I should be obliged for a hint of it.  I
actually have a printed copy of verses by his son, on the
marriage of the Princess Royal; but they are so ridiculously
unlike measure, and the man was so mad and so poor,(976) that I
determined not to mention them.

If these details, Sir, which I should have thought interesting
to no mortal but myself', should happen to amuse you, I shall
be glad; if they do not, you will learn not to question a man
who thinks it his duty to satisfy the curiosity of men of sense
and honour, and who, being of too little consequence to have
secrets, is not ambitious of the less consequence of appearing
to have any.

P. S. I must ask you one question, but to be answered entirely
at your leisure.  I have a play in rhyme called Saul, said to
be written by a peer.  I guess Lord Orrery.  If ever you happen
to find out, be so good to tell me.

(974) It is evident that Mr. Walpole has here transposed,
contrary to his meanings the references to lord Clarendon and
Polybius: the latter wrote the general history, the former the
portion of history.-C.

(975) This alludes to an epigrammatic passage in the article
"Bolingbroke" in the Noble Authors.  "He wrote against Sir
Robert Walpole, who did forgive him; and against the clergy,
who never will forgive him."@.

(976) this seems a singular reason for excluding him from a
list of authors@-C.



462 Letter 291
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Oct. 24, 1758.

I am a little sorry that my preface, like the show-cloth to a
sight, entertained you more than the bears it invited you in to
see.  I don't mean that I am not glad to have written any thing
that meets your approbation, but if Lord Whitworth's work is
not better than my preface, I fear he has much less merit than
I thought he had.

Your complaint of your eyes makes me feel for you: mine have
been very weak again, and I am taking the bark, which did them
so much service last year.  I don't know how to give up the
employment of them, I mean reading; for as to writing, I am
absolutely winding up my bottom, for twenty reasons.  The
first, and perhaps the best, I have writ enough.  The next; by
what I have writ, the world thinks I am not a fool, which was
just what I wished them to think, having always lived in terror
of that oracular saying Ermu naidex luchoi, which Mr. Bentley
translated with so much more parts than the vain and malicious
hero could have done that set him the task, --I mean his
father, the sons of heroes are loobies.  My last reason is, I
find my little stock of reputation very troublesome, both to
maintain and to undergo the consequences--it has dipped me in
erudite correspondences--I receive letters every week that
compliment my learning; now, as there is nothing I hold so
cheap as a learned man, except an unlearned one, this title Is
insupportable to me; if' I have not a care, I shall be called
learned, till somebody abuses me for not being learned, as
they, not I, fancied I was.  In short, I propose to have
nothing more to do with the world, but divert myself in it as
an obscure passenger--pleasure, virt`u, politics, and
literature, I have tried them all, and have had enough of them.
Content and tranquillity, with now and then a little of three
of them, that I may not grow morose, shall satisfy the rest of
a life that is to have much idleness, and I hope a little
goodness; for politics--a long adieu! With some of the Cardinal
de Retz's experience, though with none of his genius, I see the
folly of taking a violent part without any view, (I don't mean
to commend a violent part with a view, that is still worse;) I
leave the state to be scrambled for by Mazarine, at once
cowardly and enterprising, ostentatious, jealous, and false; by
Louvois, rash and dark; by Colbert, the affecter of national
interest, with designs not much better; and I leave the Abb`e
de la Rigbi`ere to sell the weak Duke of Orleans to whoever has
money to buy him, or would buy him to get money; at least these
are my present reflections--if I should change them to-morrow,
remember I am not only a human creature, but that I am I, that
is, one of the weakest of human creatures, and so sensible of
my fickleness that I am sometimes inclined to keep a diary of
my mind, as people do of the weather.  To-day you see it
temperate, to-morrow it may again blow politics and be stormy;
for while I have so much quicksilver left, I fear my
passionometer will be susceptible of sudden changes.  What do
years give one? Experience; experience, what? Reflections;
reflections, what?  nothing that I ever could find--nor can I
well agree with Waller, that

"The soul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,
Lets in new light through chinks that time has made."

Chinks I am afraid there are, but instead of new light, I find
nothing but darkness visible, that serves only to discover
sights of Wo.  I look back through my chinks--I find errors,
follies, faults; forward, old age and death, pleasures fleeting
from me, no virtues succeeding to their place--il faut avouer,
I want all my quicksilver to make such a background receive any
other objects!

I am glad Mr. Frederick Montagu thinks so well of me as to be
sure I shall be glad to see him without an invitation.  For
you, I had already perceived that you would not come to
Strawberry this year.  Adieu!



463 Letter 292
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 24, 1758.

It is a very melancholy present I send you here, my dear Sir;
yet, considering the misfortune that has befallen us, perhaps
the most agreeable I could send you.  You will not think it the
bitterest tear you have shed when you drop one over this plan
of an urn inscribed with the name of your dear brother, and
with the testimonial of my eternal affection to him!  This
little monument is at last placed over the pew of your family
at Linton, and I doubt whether any tomb was ever erected that
spoke so much truth of the departed, and flowed from so much
sincere friendship in the living.  The thought was my own,
adopted from the antique columbaria, and applied to Gothic.
The execution of the design was Mr. Bentley's, who alone, of
all mankind, could unite the grace of Grecian architecture and
the irregular lightness and solemnity of Gothic.  Kent and many
of our builders sought this, but have never found it.  Mr.
Chute, who has as much taste @s Mr. Bentley, thinks this little
sketch a perfect model.  The soffite is more beautiful than any
thing of either style separate.  There is a little error in the
inscription; it should be Horatius Walpole posuit.  The urn is
of marble, richly polished; the rest of stone.  On the whole, I
think there is simplicity and decency, with a degree of
ornament that destroys neither.

What do you say in Italy on the assassination of the King of
Portugal?  Do you believe that Portuguese subjects lift their
hand against a monarch for gallantry?  Do you believe that when
a slave murders an absolute prince, he goes a walking with his
wife the next morning and murders her too'! Do you believe the
dead King is alive?  and that the Jesuits are as wrongfully
suspected of this assassination as they have been of many
others they have committed?  If you do believe this, and all
this, you are not very near turning Protestants.  It is scarce
talked of here, and to save trouble, we admit just what the
Portuguese minister is ordered to publish.  The King of
Portugal murdered, throws us two hundred years back--the King
of Prussia not murdered, carries us two hundred years forward
again.

Another King, I know, has had a little blow: the Prince de
Soubise has beat some Isenbourgs and Obergs, and is going to be
Elector of Hanover this winter.  There has been a great
sickness among our troops in the other German army; the Duke of
Marlborough has been in great danger, and some officers are
dead.  Lord Frederick Cavendish is returned from France.  He
confirms and adds to the amiable accounts we had received of
the Duc d'Aiguillon's behaviour to our prisoners.  You
yourself, the pattern of attentions and tenderness, could not
refine on what he has done both in good-nature and
good-breeding: he even forbad any ringing of bells or
rejoicings wherever they passed--but how your representative
blood will curdle when you hear of the absurdity of one of your
countrymen: the night after the massacre at St. Cas, the Duc
d'Aiguillon gave a magnificent supper of eighty covers to our
prisoners--a Colonel Lambert got up at the bottom of the table,
and asking for a bumper, called out to the Duc, "My Lord Duke,
here's the Roy de France!"  You must put all the English you
can crowd into the accent.  My Lord Duke was so confounded at
this preposterous compliment, which it was impossible for him
to return, that he absolutely sank back into his chair and
could not utter a syllable: our own people did not scorn to
feel more.

You will read and hear that we have another expedition sailing,
somewhither in the West Indies.  Hobson, the commander, has in
his whole life had but one stroke of a palsy, so possibly may
retain half of his understanding at least.  There is great
tranquillity at home, but I should think not promising
duration.  The disgust in the army on the late frantic measures
will furnish some warmth probably to Parliament--and if the
French should think of returning our visits, should you wonder?
There are even rumours of some stirring among your little
neighbours at Albano--keep your eye on them--if you could
discover any thing in time, it would do you great credit.
Apropos to them,, I will send you an epigram that I made the
other day on Mr. Chute's asking why Taylor the oculist called
himself Chevalier.

Why Taylor the quack calls himself Chevalier,
'Tis not easy a reason to render;
Unless he would own, what his practice makes clear,
That at best he is but a Pretender.



465 Letter 293
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Nov. 26, 1758.

How can you make me formal excuses for sending me a few covers
to frank?  Have you so little right to any act of friendship
from me, that you should apologize for making me do what is
scarce any act at all?  However, your man has not called for
the covers, although they have been ready this fortnight.

I shall be very glad to see your brother in town, but I cannot
quite take him in full of payment.  I trust you will stay the
longer for coming the later.  There is not a syllable of news.
The Parliament is met, but empty and totally oppositionless.
Your great Cu moved in the lords, but did not shine much.  The
great Cu of all Cues is out of order, not in danger, but
certainly breaking.

My eyes are performing such a strict quarantine, that you must
excuse my brevity.  Adieu.



465 Letter 294
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 27, 1758.


it seems strange that at this time of the year, with armies
still in the field and Parliaments in town, I should have had
nothing to tell you for above a month--yet so it was.  The King
caught cold on coming to town, and was very ill,(977) but the
gout, which had never been at court above twice in his reign,
came, seized his foot a little, and has promised him at least
five or six years more--that is, if he will take care of
himself; but yesterday, the coldest day we have felt, he would
go into the drawing-room, as if he was fond of showing the new
stick @e is forced to walk with.

The Parliament is all harmony, and thinks of nothing but giving
away twelve more millions.  Mr. Pitt made the most artful
speech he ever made: provoked, called for, defied objections;
promised enormous expense, demanded never to be judged by
events.  Universal silence left him arbiter of his own terms.
In short, at present he is absolute master, and if he can coin
twenty millions may command them.  He does every thing, the
Duke of Newcastle gives every thing.  As long as they can agree
in this partition, they may do what they will.

We have been in great anxiety for twenty-four hours to learn
the fate of Dresden, and of the King of resources, as Mr.
Beckford called the King of Prussia the other day.  We heard
that while he was galloped to raise the siege of Neiss, Marshal
Daun was advanced to Dresden; that Schmettau had sent to know
if he meant to attack it, having orders to burn the Fauxbourgs
and defend it street by street; that Daun not deigning a reply,
the Conflagration had been put in execution; that the King was
posting back, and Dohna advancing to join him.  We expect to
hear either of the demolition of the city, or of a bloody
decision fought under the walls--an account is just arrived
that Daun(978) is retired, thus probably the campaign is
finished, and another year of massacre to come.  One could not
but be anxious at such a crisis-one felt for Dresden, and
pitied the Prince Royal shut up in his own capital, a mere
spectator of its destruction; one trembled for the decisive
moment of the life of such a man as the King of Prussia.  It is
put off--yet perhaps he will scarce recover so favourable a
moment.  He had assembled his whole force, except a few
thousands left to check the Swedes.  Next year this force must
be again parcelled out against Austrians, Russians, Swedes, and
possibly French.  He must be more than a King Of resources if
he can for ever weather such tempests!

Knyphausen(979) diverted me yesterday with some anecdotes of
the Empress's college of chastity-not the Russian Empress's.
The King of Prussia asked some of his Austrian prisoners
whether their mistress consulted her college of chastity on the
letters she wrote (and he intercepted) to Madame Pompadour.

You have heard some time ago of the death of the Duke of
Marlborough.(980)  The estate is forty-five thousand pounds
a-year--nine of which are jointured out.  He paid but eighteen
thousand pounds a-year in joint lives.  This Duke and the
estate save greatly by his death, as the present wants a year
of being of age, and would certainly have accommodated his
father in agreeing to sell and pay.  Lord Edgcumbe(981) is dead
too, one of the honestest and most steady men in the world.

I was much diverted with your histories of our Princess(982)
and Madame de Woronzow.  Such dignity as Madame de Craon's
wants a little absolute power to support it!  Adieu! my dear
Sir.

(977) Lord Chesterfield, writing on the 21st to his son, says,
"The King has been ill; but his illness has terminated in a
good fit of the gout.  It was generally thought he would have
died, and for a very good reason; for the oldest lion in the
Tower, much about the King's age, died about a fortnight ago.
This extravagancy, I can assure you, was believed by many above
people.  So wild and capricious is the human mind!"-E.

(978) "The King of Prussia has just compelled Daun to raise the
siege of Dresden, in spite of his (the King's) late most
disastrous defeat by the same general at Bochkirchen, which had
taken place on the 14th of October, 1758.-D.

(979) The Prussian minister.

(980) Charles Spencer, second Duke of Marlborough.  He died, on
the 28th of October at Munster, in Westphalia.-E.

(981) Richard, first Lord Edgcumbe; an intimate friend of Sir
Robert Walpole.

(982) The Princess Craon.



467 Letter 295
To The Rev. Henry Zouch.
Arlington Street, Dec. 9, 1758.

Sir,
I have desired Mr. Whiston to convey to you the second edition
of my Catalogue, not so complete as it might have been, if
great part had not been printed before I received your remarks,
but yet more correct than the first sketch with which I
troubled you.  Indeed, a thing of this slight and idle nature
does not deserve to have much more pains employed upon it.

I am just undertaking an edition of Lucan, my friend Mr.
Bentley having in his possession his father's notes and
emendations on the first seven books.  Perhaps a partiality for
the original author concurs a little. with this circumstance of
the notes, to make me fond of printing, at Strawberry Hill, the
works of a man who, alone of all the classics, was thought to
breathe too brave and honest a spirit for the perusal of the
Dauphin and the French.  I don't think that a good or bad taste
in poetry is of so serious a nature, that I should be afraid of
owning too, that, with that great judge Corneille, and with
that, perhaps, no judge Heinsius, I prefer Lucan to Virgil.  To
speak fairly, I prefer great sense to poetry with little sense.
There are hemistics in Lucan that go to one's soul and one's
heart;--for a mere epic poem, a fabulous tissue of
uninteresting battles that don't teach one even to fight, I
know nothing more tedious.  The poetic images, the
versification and language of the Aeneid are delightful; but
take the story by itself, and can any thing be more silly and
unaffeCting?  There are a few gods without power, heroes
without character, heaven-directed wars without justice,
inventions without probability, and a hero who betrays one
woman with a kingdom that he might have had, to force himself
upon another woman and another kingdom to which he had no
pretensions, and all this to show his obedience to the gods! In
short, I have always admired his numbers so much, and his
meaning so little, that I think I should like Virgil better if
I understood him less.

Have you seen, Sir, a book which has made some noise--Helvetius
de l'Esprit?  The author is so good and moral a man, that I
grieve he should have published a system of as relaxed morality
as can well be imagined.-. 'tis a large quarto, and in general
a very superficial one.  His philosophy may be new in France,
but is greatly exhausted here.  He tries to imitate
Montesquieu, and has heaped commonplaces upon commonplaces,
which supply or overwhelm his reasoning; yet he has often wit,
happy allusion;, and sometimes writes finely: there is merit
enough to give an obscure man fame; flimsiness enough to
depreciate a great man.  After his book was licensed, they
forced him to retract it by a most abject recantation.  Then
why print this book?  If zeal for his system pushed him to
propagate it, did not he consider that a recantation would hurt
his cause more than his arguments could support it.

We are promised Lord Clarendon in February from Oxford, though
I hear shall have the surreptitious edition from Holland much
sooner.

You see, Sir, I am a sceptic as well as Helvetius, but of a
more moderate complexion.  There is no harm in telling mankind
that there is not so much divinity in the Aeneid as they
imagine; but, (Even if I thought so,) I would not preach that
virtue and friendship are mere names, and resolvable into
self-interest; because there are numbers that would remember
the grounds of the principle, and forget what was to be
engrafted on it.  Adieu!



468 Letter 296
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Christmas-day, 1758.

Adieu! my dear Sir--that is, adieu to our correspondence, for I
am neither dying nor quarrelling with you; but as we, Great-
Britons, are quarrelling with all Europe, I think very soon I
shall not be able to convey a letter to you, but by the way of
Africa, and am afraid the post-offices are not very well
regulated.  In short, we are on the brink of a Dutch war too.
Their merchants are so enraged that we will not only not suffer
them to enrich themselves by carrying all the French trade, and
all kinds of military stores to the French settlements, but
that they lose their own ships into the bargain, that they are
ready to despatch the Princess Royal(983) into the other world
even before her time; if her death arrives soon, and she is
thought in great danger, it will be difficult for any body else
to keep the peace.  Spain and Denmark are in little better
humour--well, if We have not as many lives as a cat or the King
of Prussia!  However, our spirits do not droop; we are raising
thirteen millions, we look upon France as totally undone, and
that they have not above five loaves and a few small fishes
left; we intend to take all America from them next summer, and
then if Spain and Holland are not terrified, we shall be at
leisure to deal with them.  Indeed, we are rather in a hurry to
do all this, because people may be weary of paying thirteen
millions; and besides it may grow decent for Mr. Pitt to visit
his gout, which this year he has been forced to send to the
Bath without him.  I laugh, but seriously we are in a critical
situation; and it is as true, that if Mr. Pitt had not exerted
the spirit and activity that he has, we should ere now have
been past a critical situation.  Such a war as ours carried on
by my Lord Hardwicke, with the dull dilatoriness of a Chancery
suit, would long ago have reduced us to what suits in Chancery
reduce most people!  At present our unanimity is prodigious--
you Would as soon hear No from an old maid as from the House of
Commons--but I don't promise you that this tranquillity will
last.(984)  One has known more ministries overturned of late
years by their own squabbles than by any assistance from
Parliaments.

Sir George Lee, formerly an heir-apparent(985) to the ministry
is dead.  it was almost sudden, but he died with great
composure.  Lord Arran(986) went off with equal philosophy.  Of
the great house of Ormond there now remains only his sister,
Lady Emily Butler, a young heiress of ninety-nine.

It is with great pleasure I tell you that Mr. Conway is going
to Sluys to settle a cartel with the French.  The commission
itself is honourable, but more pleasing as it re-establishes
him--I should say his merit re-establishes him.  All the world
now acknowledges it--and the insufficiency of his
brother-generals makes it vain to oppress him any longer.

I am happy that you are pleased with the monument, and vain
that you like the Catalogue(987)--if it would not look too
vain, I would tell you that it was absolutely undertaken and
finished within five months.  Indeed, the faults in the first
edition and the deficiencies show it was; I have just printed
another more correct.

Of the Pretender's family one never hears a word: unless our
Protestant brethren the Dutch meddle in their affairs, they
will be totally forgotten; we have too numerous a breed of our
own, to want Princes from Italy.  The old Chevalier by your
account is likely to precede his rival, who with care may still
last a few years, though I think will scarce appear again out
of his own house.

I want to ask you if it is possible to get the royal edition of
the Antiquities of Herculaneum?(988) and I do not indeed want
you to get it for me unless I am to pay for it.  Prince San
Severino has told the foreign ministers here that there are to
be twelve hundred volumes, of it--and they believe it.  I
imagine the fact is, that there are but twelve hundred copies
printed.  Could Cardinal Albani get it for me?  I would send
him my Strawberry-editions, and the Birmingham-editions(988) in
exchange--things here much in fashion.

The night before I came from town, we heard of the fall of the
Cardinal de Bernis,(989) but not the cause of it(990)--if we
have a Dutch war, how many cardinals will fall in France and in
England, before you hear of these or I of the former!  I have
always written to you with the greatest freedom, because I care
more that you should be informed of the state of your own
country, than what secretaries of state or their clerks think
of me,--but one must be more circumspect if the Dey of Algiers
is to open one's letters.  Adieu!

(983) The Princess Dowager of Orange, eldest daughter of George
II.

(984) Lord Chesterfield, in a letter of the 15th, says, "The
estimates for the expenses of the year 1759 are made up.  I
have seen them; and what do you think they amount to?  No less
than twelve millions three hundred thousand pounds: a most
incredible sum, and its yet already all subscribed, and even
more offered!  The unanimity in the House of Commons in voting
such a sum, and such forces, both by sea and land, is not less
astonishing.  This is Mr. Pitt's doing, and it is marvellous in
our eyes."-E.

(985) Frederick, Prince of Wales, had designed, if he outlived
the King, to make Sir George Lee chancellor of the exchequer.

(986) He was Charles Butler, the second and last surviving son
of Thomas, Earl of Ossory, eldest son of the first Duke of
Ormond.  He had been created, in 1693, Baron Clogligrenan,
Viscount Tullough, and Earl of Arran, in Ireland; and at the
same time Baron Butler of Weston, in the Peerage of England.
Dying without issue his titles became extinct.-D.

(987) The Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors.

(988) Editions printed with the Baskerville types.-D.

(989) The Cardinal de Bernis was a frivolous and incapable
minister, who was equally raised and overthrown by the
influence of the King of France's mistress, Madame de
Pompadour.-D.

(990) "Cardinal Bernis's disgrace," says Lord Chesterfield, "is
as sudden, and hitherto as little understood, as his elevation
was.  I have seen his poems printed at Paris, not by a friend,
I dare say; and, to judge by them, I humbly conceive his
excellency is a puppy.  I will say nothing of that excellent
headpiece that made him and unmade him in the same month,
except O King, live for ever!"-E.



470 Letter 297
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Dec. 26th, 1758.

it is so little extraordinary to find you doing what is
friendly and obliging, that one don't take half notice enough
of it.  Can't you let Mr. Conway go to Sluys without taking
notice of it?  How would you be hurt, if he continued to be
oppressed? what is it to you whether I am glad or sorry?  Can't
you enjoy yourself whether I am happy or not'--'@ I suppose If
I were to have a misfortune, you would immediately be concerned
at it!  How troublesome it is to have you sincere and
good-natured!  Do be a little more like the rest of the world.

I have been at Strawberry these three days, and don't know a
tittle.  The last thing I heard before I went was that Colonel
Yorke is to be married to one or both of the Miss Crasteyns,
nieces of the rich grocer that died three years ago.  They have
two hundred and sixty thousand pounds apiece.  A marchioness--
or a grocer---nothing comes amiss to the digestion of that
family.(991)  If the rest of the trunk was filled with money, I
believe they would really marry Carafattatouadaht--what was the
lump of deformity called in the Persian Tales, that was sent to
the lady in a coffer?  And as to marrying both the girls, it
would cost my Lord Hardwicke but a new marriage-bill: I suppose
it is all one to his conscience whether he prohibits matrimony
or licenses bigamy.  Poor Sir Charles Williams is relapsed, and
strictly confined.

As you come so late, I trust you will stay with us the longer.
Adieu!


(991) Colonel Yorke, afterwards Lord Dover, married in 1783 the
Dowager Baroness de Boetzalaer, widow of the first noble of the
province of Holland.-E.



471 Letter 298
To The Rev. Henry Zouch.
Strawberry Hill, Jan. 12, 1759.

Sir,
I shall certainly be obliged to you for an account of that
piece of Lord Lonsdale:(992) besides my own curiosity in any
thing that relates to a work in which I have engaged so far, I
think it a duty to the public to perfect, as far as one can,
whatever one gives to it; and yet I do not think of another
edition; two thousand have peen printed, and though nine
hundred went off at once, it would be presumption in me to
expect that the rest will be sold in any short time.  I only
mean to add occasionally to my private copy whatever more I can
collect and correct; and shall perhaps, but leave behind me
materials for a future edition, in which should be included
what I have hitherto omitted.  Yet it is very vain in me to
expect that any body should care for such a trifle after the
novelty is worn off; I ought to be content with the favourable
reception I have found; so much beyond my first expectations,
that, except in two Magazines, not a word of censure has passed
on me in print.  You may easily believe, Sir, that having
escaped a trial, I am not mortified by having dirt thrown at me
by children in the kennel.  With regard to the story of Lord
Suffolk, I wish I had been lucky enough to have mentioned it to
you in time, it should not have appeared: yet it was told me by
Mr. Mallet, who did not seem to have any objection that I
should even mention his name as the very person to whom it
happened.  I must suppose that Lord Suffolk acted that foolish
scene in imitation of Lord Rochester.(993)

I am happy, Sir, that I have both your approbation to my
opinion of Lucan, and to my edition of him; but I assure you
there will not be one word from me.  I am sensible that it
demands great attention to write even one's own language well:
how can one pretend to purify a foreign language? to any merit
in a dead one?  I would not alone undertake to correct the
press; but I am so lucky as to live in the strictest friendship
with Dr. Bentley's Only Son, Who, to all the ornament of
learning, has the amiable turn of mind, disposition, and easy
wit.  Perhaps you have heard that his drawings and architecture
are admirable,--perhaps you have not: he is modest--he is poor-
-he is consequently little known, less valued.

I am entirely ignorant of Dr. Burton and his Monasticon,(994)
and after the little merit you tell me it has, I must explain
to you that I have a collection of books of that sort, before I
own that I wish to own it; at the same time, I must do so much
justice to myself as to protest that I don't know so
contemptible a class of writers as topographers, not from the
study itself, but from their wretched execution.  Often and
often I have had an inclination to show how topography should
be writ, by pointing out the curious particulars of places,
with descriptions of principal houses, the pictures, portraits,
and Curiosities they contain.

I scarce ever yet found any thing one wanted to know in one of
those books; all they contain, except encomiums on the Stuarts
and the monks, are lists of institutions and inductions, and
inquiries how names of places were spelt before there was any
spelling.  If the Monasticon Eboracense is only to be had at
York, I know Mr. Caesar Ward, and can get him to send it to me.

I will add but one short word: from every letter I receive from
you, Sir, my opinion of you increases, and I much wish that so
much good sense and knowledge were not thrown away only on me.
I flatter myself that you are engaged, or will engage, in some
work or pursuit that will make you better known.  In the mean
time, I hope that some opportunity will bring us personally
acquainted, for I am, Sir, already most sincerely yours,
Hor. Walpole.

P. S. You love to be troubled, and therefore I will make no
apology for troubling you.  Last summer, I bought of Vertue's
widow forty volumes of his ms. corrections relating to English
painters, sculptors, gravers, and architects.  He had actually
begun their lives: unluckily he had not gone far, and could not
write grammar.  I propose to digest and complete this work (I
mean after the Conway Papers).(995)  In the mean time, Sir,
shall I beg the favour of you just to mark down memorandums of
the pages where you happen to meet with any thing relative to
these subjects, especially of our antienter buildings,
paintings, and artists.  I would not trouble you for more
reference, if even that is not too much.

(992) Mr. Walpole did not insert any notice of Lord Lonsdale in
his subsequent editions, though the omission has been remedied
by Mr. Park.  The piece to which Mr. Zouch probably alluded,
the knowledge of which he may have derived from the noble
family of Lowther, was " a "Treatise on Economies" addressed to
his son, by Sir John Lowther, created Baron Lonsdale in 1696.
This treatise was never published.-C.

(993) The story here alluded to is told, in the Noble Authors,
of Edward Howard, eighth Earl of Suffolk.  But Mr. Zouch had
probably apprised Mr. Walpole, that a similar story had been
told of Lord Rochester.  The Earl is represented as having sent
for " a gentleman well known in the literary world," (Mallet,)
upon whom he inflicted the hearing of some of his verses; but
coming to the description of a beautiful woman, he suddenly
stopped, and said, "Sir, I am not like most poets; I do not
draw from ideal mistresses; I always have my subject before
me;" and ringing the bell, be said to a footman, "Call up Fine
Eyes."  A woman of the town appeared--"Fine Eyes," said the
Earl, "look full on this gentleman."  She did, and retired.
Two or three others of the seraglio were summoned in their
turns, and displayed their respective charms for which they had
been distinguished by his lordship's pencil.-C.

(994) Dr. John Burton was a physician and antiquary of
Yorkshire, who died in 1771.  His principal work, here alluded
to, is entitled "Monasticon Eboracense."  This work was never
completed, the first volume only having appeared in folio.
Some imputations on the Doctor's loyalty in 1745, diminished,
it is said, his means and materials for continuing the Work.-C.

473 Letter 299
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Arlington Street, Jan. 19, 1759.

I hope the treaty of Sluys advances rapidly.(996)  Considering
that your own court is as new to you as Monsieur de Bareil and
his, you cannot be very well entertained: the joys of a Dutch
fishing town and the incidents of a cartel will not compose a
very agreeable history.  In the mean time you do not lose much:
though the Parliament is met, no politics are come to town: one
may describe the House of Commons like the price of stocks;
Debates, nothing done.  Votes, under par.  Patriots, no price.
Oratory, books shut.  Love and war are as much at a stand;
neither the Duchess of Hamilton nor the expeditions are gone
off yet.  Prince Edward has asked to go to Quebec, and has been
refused.  If I was sure they would refuse me, I would ask to go
thither too.  I should not dislike about as much laurel as I
could stick in my window at Christmas.

We are next week to have a serenata at the Opera-house for the
King of Prussia's birthday: it is to begin, "Viva Georgio, e
Federico viva!" It will, I own, divert me to see my Lord Temple
whispering for this alliance, on the same bench on which I have
so often seen him whisper against all Germany.  The new opera
pleases universally, and I hope will yet hold up its head.
Since Vanneschi is cunning enough to make us sing the roast
Beef of old Germany, I am persuaded it will revive: politics
are the only lhotbed for keeping such a tender plant as Italian
music alive in England.

You are so thoughtless about your dress, that I cannot help
giving you a little warning against your return.  Remember,
every body that comes from abroad is cens`e to come from
France, and whatever they wear at their first reappearance
immediately grows the fashion.  Now if, as is very likely, you
should through inadvertence change hats with a master of a
Dutch smack, Offley will be upon the watch, will conclude you
took your pattern from M. de Bareil, and in a week's time we
shall all be equipped like Dutch skippers.  You see I speak
very disinterestedly; for, as I never wear a hat myself, it is
indifferent to me what sort of hat I don't wear.  Adieu! I hope
nothing in this letter, if it is opened, will affect the
conferences, nor hasten our rupture with Holland.  Lest it
should, I send it to Lord Holderness's office; concluding, like
Lady Betty Waldegrave, that the government never suspect what
they send under their own covers.

(996) Mr. Conway was sent to Sluys to settle a cartel for
prisoners with the French.  M. de Bareil was the person
appointed by the French court for the same business.



473 Letter 300
The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Arlington Street, Jan. 28, 1759.

You and M. de Bareil may give yourselves what airs you please
of settling cartels with expedition: you don't exchange
prisoners with half so much alacrity as Jack Campbell(997) and
the Duchess of Hanillton have exchanged hearts.  I had so
little observed the negotiation, Or suspected any, that when
your brother told me of it yesterday morning, I would not
believe a tittle--I beg Mr. Pitt's pardon, not an iota.  It is
the prettiest match in the world since yours, and every body
likes it but the Duke of Bridgewater and Lord Coventry. What an
extraordinary fate is attached to those two women!  Who could
have believed that a Gunning would unite the two great houses
of Campbell and Hamilton?  For my part, I expect to see my Lady
Coventry Queen of Prussia.  I would not venture to marry either
of them these thirty years, for fear of being shuffled out of
the world prematurely, to make room for the rest of their
adventures.  The first time Jack carries the Duchess into the
Highlands, I am persuaded that some of his second-sighted
subjects will see him in a winding-sheet, with a train of kings
behind him as long as those in Macbeth.

We had a scrap of a debate on Friday, on the Prussian and
Hessian treaties.  Old Vyner opposed the first, in pity to that
poor woman, as he called her, the Empress-Queen.(998)  Lord
Strange objected to the gratuity of sixty thousand pounds to
the Landgrave, unless words were inserted to express his
receiving that Sum in full of all demands.  If Hume Campbell
had cavilled at this favourite treaty, Mr. Pitt could scarce
have treated him with more haughtiness; and, what is far more
extraordinary, Hume Campbell could scarce have taken it more
dutifully.  This long day was over by half an hour after four.


As you and M. de Bareil are on such amicable terms, you will
take care to soften to him a new conquest we have made.  Keppel
has taken the island of Goree.  You great ministers know enough
Of its importance: I need not detail it.  Before your letters
came we had heard of the death of the Princess Royal:(999) you
will find us black and all black.  Lady Northumberland and the
great ladies put off their assemblies: diversions begin again
to-morrow with the mourning.

You perceive London cannot furnish half so long a letter as the
little town of Sluys; at least I have not the art of making one
out.  In truth, I believe I should not have writ this unless
Lady Ailesbury had bid me; but she does not care how much
trouble it gives me, provided it amuses you for a moment.  Good
night!

P. S. I forgot to tell you that the King has granted my Lord
Marischall's pardon, at the request of M. de Knyphausen.(1000)
I believe the Pretender himself could get his attainder
reversed if he would apply to the King of Prussia.

(997) Afterwards Duke of Argyle.

(998) "There never was so quiet or so silent a session of
Parliament as the present: Mr. Pitt declares only what he would
have them do, and they do it, nemine contradicente, Mr. Vyner
only excepted."  Lord Chesterfield.-E.

(999) The Princess of Orange died on the 12th of January.-E.

(1000) By a letter from Sir Andrew Mitchell, of the 8th of
January, in the Chatham correspondence, it will be seen that
the Lord of Marischal's pardon was granted at the earnest
request of the King of Prussia, who said he " should consider
it as a personal favour done to himself." The Earl Marischal
was attainted for his share in the rebellion of 1715.-E.



475 Letter 301
To John Chute, Esq.(1001)
Arlington Street, Feb. 1, 1759.

Well! my dear Sir, I am now convinced that both Mr. Keate's
panic and mine were ill-founded; but pray, another time, don't
let him be afraid of being afraid for fear of frightening me:
on the contrary, if you will dip your gout in lemonade, I hope
I shall be told of it. If you have not had it in Your stomach,
it is not your fault: drink brandy, and be thankful.  I would
desire you to come to town, but I must rather desire you not to
have a house to come to.  Mrs. H. Grenville is passionately
enamoured of yours, and begged I would ask you what will be the
lowest price, with all the particulars, which I assured her you
had stated very ill for yourself.  I don't quite like this
commission; if you part with your house in town, you will never
come hither; at least, stow your cellars with drams and
gunpowder as full as Guy Fawkcs's-you will be drowned if you
don't blow yourself up.  I don't believe that the Vine is
within the verge of the rainbow: seriously, it is too damp for
you.
Colonel Campbell marries the Duchess of Hamilton forthwith.
the house of Argyle is CONTENT, and think that the head of the
Hamilton's had purified the blood of Gunning; but I should be
afraid that his grace was more likely to corrupt blood than to
mend it.

Never was any thing so crowded as the house last night for the
Prussian cantata; the King was hoarse, and could not go to Sing
his own praises.  The dancers seemed transplanted from Sadler's
Wells; there were milkmaids riding on dolphins; Britain and
Prussia kicked the King of France off the stage, and there was
a petit-maitre with his handkerchief full of holes; but this
vulgarism happily was hissed.

I am deeper than ever in Gothic antiquities: I have bought a
monk of Glastonbury's chair, full of scraps of the Psalms; and
some seals of most reverend illegibility.  I pass all my
mornings in the thirteenth century, and my evenings with the
century that is coming on.  Adieu!

(1001) Now first printed.



475 Letter 302
To John Chute, Esq.(1002)
Arlington Street, Feb. 2, 1759.

My dear sir,
I am glad to see your writing again, and can now laugh very
cordially at my own fright, which you take a great deal too
kindly.  I was not quite sure you would like my proceedings,
but just then I could not help it, and perhaps my natural
earnestness had more merit than my friendship; and yet it is
worth my while to save a friend if I think I can--I have not so
many!  You yourself are in a manner lost to me!  I must not,
cannot repine at your having a fortune that delivers you from
uneasy connexions with a world that is sure to use ill those
that have any dependence on it; but undoubtedly some of the
satisfaction that you have acquired is taken out of my scale; I
will not, however, moralize, though I am in a very proper
humour for it, being just come home from an outrageous crowd at
Northumberland-house, where there were five hundred people,
that would have been equally content or discontent with any
other five hundred.  This is pleasure!  You invite so many
people to your house, that you are forced to have constables at
your door to keep the peace; just as the royal family, when
they hunted, used to be attended by surgeons.  I allow honour
and danger to keep company with one another, but diversion and
breaking one's neck are strangely ill-matched.  Mr. Spence's
Magliabechi(1003) is published to-day from Strawberry; I
believe you saw it, and shall have it; but 'tis not worth
sending you on purpose.  However, it is full good enough for
the generality of readers.  At least there is a proper dignity
in my saying so, who have been so much abused in all the
magazines lately for my Catalogue.  The points in dispute lie
in a very narrow compass: they think I don't understand
English, and I am sure they don't: yet they will not be
convinced, for I shall certainly not take the pains to set them
right.  Who them are I don't know; the highest, I believe, are
Dr. Smollet, or some chaplain of my uncle.

Adieu! I was very silly to alarm you so; but the wisest of' us,
from Solomon to old Carr's cousin, are poor souls!  May be you
don't know any thing of Carr's cousin.  Why then, Carr's cousin
was--I don't know who; but Carr was very ill, and had a cousin,
as I may be, to sit up with her.  Carr had not slept for many
nights--at last she dozed--her cousin jogged her: "Cousin,
cousin!"--"Well!" said Carr, "what would you have?"--"Only,
cousin, if you die where will you be buried?"  This resemblance
mortifies me ten times more than a thousand reviews could do:
there is nothing in being abused by Carr's cousin, but it is
horrid to be like Carr's cousin Good night!

476 Letter 303
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Feb. 9, 1759.

The Dutch have not declared war and interrupted our
correspondence, and yet it seems ceased as if we had declared
war with one another.  I have not heard from you this age--how
happens it?  I have not seized any ships of yours--you carry on
no counterband trade--oh! perhaps you are gone incognito to
Turin, are determined to have a King of Prussia of your own!  I
expect to hear that the King of Sardinia, accompanied by Sir
Horace Mann, the British minister, suddenly appeared before
Parma at the head of an hundred thousand men, that had been
privately landed at Leghorn.  I beg, as Harlequin did when he
had a house to sell, that you will send me a brick, as a sample
of the first town you take-the Strawberry-press shall be
preparing a congratulatory ode.

The Princess Royal has been dead some time: and yet the Dutch
and we continue in amity, and put on our weepers together.  In
the mean time our warlike eggs have been some time under the
hen, and one has hatched and produced Gor`ee.  The expedition,
called to Quebec, departs on Tuesday next, under Wolfe, and
George Townshend, who has thrust himself again into the
service, and as far as wrongheadedness will go, very proper for
a hero.  Wolfe, who was no friend of Mr. Conway last year, and
for whom I consequently have no affection, has great merit,
spirit, and alacrity, and shone extremely at Louisbourg.  I am
not such a Juno but I will forgive him after eleven more
labours.(1004)  Prince Edward asked to go with them, but was
refused.  It is clever in him to wish to distinguish himself;
I, who have no partiality to royal blood, like his good-nature
and good-breeding.

Except the horrid Portuguese histories, that between
Jesuits(1005) and executions make one's blood run hot and cold,
we have no news.  The Parliament has taken a quieting-draught.
Of private story, the Duchess of Hamilton is going to marry
Colonel Campbell, Lady Ailesbury's brother.  It is a match that
would not disgrace Arcadia.  Her beauty has made sufficient
noise, and in some people's eyes is even improved--he has a
most pleasing countenance, person, and manner, and if they
could but carry to Scotland some of our sultry English weather,
they might restore the ancient pastoral life, when fair Kings
and queens reigned at once over their subjects and their sheep.
Besides, exactly like antediluvian lovers, they reconcile
contending clans, the great houses of Hamilton and Campbell-and
all this is brought about by a GUnning!  I talked of our sultry
weather, and this is no air.  While Italy, I suppose, is buried
in snow, we are extinguishing fires, and panting for breath.
In short, we have had a wonderful winter--beyond an earthquake
winter-we shall soon be astonished at frost, like an Indian.
Shrubs and flowers and blossoms are all in their pride; I am
not sure that in some counties the corn is not cut.

I long to hear from you; I think I never was so long without a
letter.  I hope it is from no bad reason.  Adieu!

(1004) Speaking of Wolfe in his Memoires, Walpole says,
"Ambition, industry, passion for the service, were conspicuous
in him. He seemed to breathe for nothing but fame, and lost no
moments in qualifying himself to compass that object.
Presumption on himself was necessary for his object, and he had
it.  He was formed to execute the designs of such a master as
Pitt."-E.

(1005) The strange and mysterious conspiracy against the life
of the King of Portugal, which was attempted as he was going,
one night through the streets of Lisbon in his coach. many
Jesuits were put to death for it, and also several of the noble
families of the Dukes d'Aveiro, and Marquises of Tavora.-D.

478 Letter 304
To Mr. Gray.
Arlington Street, Feb. 15, 1759

The enclosed, which I have this minute received from Mr.
Bentley, explains much that I had to say to you-yet I have a
question or two more.

Who and what sort of a man is a Mr. Sharp of Benet?  I have
received a most obliging and genteel letter from him, with the
very letter of Edward VI. which you was so good as to send me.
I answered his, but should like to know a little more about
him.  Pray thank the Dean of Lincoln too for me: I am much
obliged to him for his offer, but had rather draw upon his
Lincolnship than his Cambridgehood.(1006)  In the library of
the former are some original letters of Tiptoft, as you will
find in my Catalogue.  When Dr. Greene is there, I shall be
glad if he will let me have them copied.

I will thank you if you will look in some provincial history of
Ireland for Odo (Hugh) Oneil, King of Ulster.  When did he
live?  I have got a most curious seal of his, and know no more
of him than of Ouacraw King of the Pawwaws.

I wanted to ask you, whether you, or anybody that you believe
in, believe in the Queen of Scots' letter to Queen
Elizabeth.(1007)  If it is genuine, I don't wonder she cut her
head off--but I think it must be some forgery that was not made
use of.

Now to my distress.  You must have seen an advertisement
perhaps the book itself, the villanous book itself, that has
been published to defend me against the Critical Review.(1008)
I have been childishly unhappy about it, and had drawn up a
protestation or affidavit of my knowing nothing of it; but my
friends would not let me publish it.  I sent to the printer,
who would not discover the author--nor could I guess.  They
tell me nobody can suspect my being privy to It but there is an
intimacy affected that I think will deceive many--and yet I
must be the most arrogant fool living, if I could know and
suffer any body to speak of me in that style.  For God's sake
do all you can for me, and publish my abhorrence.  To-day I am
told that it Is that puppy Dr. Hill, who has chosen to make war
with the magazines through my sides.  I could pardon him any
abuse, but I never can forgive this friendship.  Adieu!

(1006 He was master of Benet College, Cambridge.

(1007) See Murden's State Papers, p. 558, for this curious
letter.

(1008) It was called "Observations on the account given of the
Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors of England, etc. etc. in
article v'- of the Critical review, No. xxv. December, 1758,
where the unwarrantable liberties taken with that work, and the
honourable author of it, are examined and exposed."



479  Letter 305
To The Right Hon. Lady hervey.
Feb. 20, 1759.

I met with this little book t'other day by chance, and it
pleased me so much that I cannot help lending it to your
ladyship, as I know it will amuse you from the same causes.  It
contains many of those important truths which history is too
proud to tell, and too dull from not telling.

Here Grignon's soul the living canvass warms:
Here fair Fontagno assumes unfading charms:
Here Mignard's pencil bows to female wit;
Louis rewards, but ratifies Fayette:
The philosophic duke, and painter too,
Thought from her thoughts--from her ideas drew.



479 Letter 306
To Sir David Dalrymple.(1009)
Strawberry Hill, Feb. 25, 1759.

I think, sir, I have perceived enough of the amiable benignity
of your mind, to be sure that you will like to hear the praises
of your friend.  Indeed, there is but one opinion about Mr.
Robertson's history.(1010)  I don't remember any other work
that ever met universal approbation.  Since the Romans and the
Greeks, who have now an exclusive charter for being the best
writers in every kind, he is the historian that pleases me
best; and though what he has been so indulgent as to say of me
ought to shut my mouth, I own I have been unmeasured in my
commendations.  I have forfeited my own modesty rather than not
do justice to him.  I did send him my opinion some time ago,
and hope he received it.  I can add, with the strictest truth,
that he is regarded here as one of the greatest men that this
island has produced.  I say island, but you know, Sir, that I
am disposed to say Scotland.  I have discovered another very
agreeable writer among your countrymen, and in a profession
where I did not look for an author; It is Mr. Ramsay,(1011) the
painter, whose pieces being anonymous have been overlooked.  He
has a great deal of genuine wit, and a very just manner of
reasoning.  In his own walk he has great merit.  He and Mr.
Reynolds are our favourite painters, and two of the very best
we ever had.  Indeed, the number of good has been very small,
considering the numbers there are.  A very few years ago there
were computed two thousand portrait painters in London; I do
not exaggerate the computation, but diminish; though I think it
must have been exaggerated.  Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Ramsay can
scarce be rivals; their manners are so different.  The former
is bold, and has a kind of tempestuous colouring, yet with
dignity and grace; the latter is all delicacy.  Mr. Reynolds
seldom succeeds in women; Mr. Ramsay is formed to paint them.

I fear I neglected, Sir, to thank you for your present of the
history of the conspiracy of the Gowries: but I shall never
forget all the obligations I have to you.  I don't doubt but in
Scotland you approve what is liked here almost as much as Mr.
Robertson's history; I mean the marriage of Colonel Campbell
and the Duchess of Hamilton.  If her fortune is singular, so is
her merit.  Such uncommon noise as her beauty made has not at
all impaired the modesty of her behaviour.  Adieu!

(1009) Now first collected.

(1010) Dr. Robertson's "History of Scotland during the Reigns
of Mary and James the Sixth," was published in the beginning of
this month.-E.

(1011) Alan Ramsay, the eminent portrait-painter, and eldest
son of the poet; on whose death, in 1757, in somewhat
embarrassed circumstances, he paid his debts.  He was an
excellent classical scholar, understood French and Italian, and
had all the polish and liberal feeling of a highly instructed
man.  In Bouquet's pamphlet on "The Present State of the Fine
Arts in England," published in 1755, he is described as "an
able painter, who, acknowledging no other guide than nature,
brought a rational taste of resemblance with him from Italy."
He died in 1784.-E.



480 Letter 307
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, March 1, 1759.

I know you are ministerial enough, or patriot enough, (two
words that it is as much the fashion to couple now as it was
formerly to part them,) to rejoice over the least bit of a
conquest, and therefore I hurry to send you a morsel of
Martinico, which you may lay under your head, and dream of
having taken the whole island.  As dreams often go by
contraries, you must not be surprised if you wake and find we
have been beaten back; but at this present moment, we are all
dreaming of victory.  A frigate has been taken going to France
with an account that our troops landed on the island on the
16th of January, without opposition.  A seventy-gun ship was
dismissed at the same time, which is thought a symptom of their
not meaning to resist.  It certainly is not Mr. Pitt's fault if
we have not great success; and if we have, it is certainly
owing to him.  The French talk of invading us; I hope they will
not come quite so near either to victory or defeat, as to land
on our Martinico! But you are going to have a war of your own.
Pray send me all your gazettes extraordinary.  I wish the King
of Sardinia's heroism may not be grown a little rusty.  Time
was when he was the only King in Europe that had fought in his
waistcoat; but now the King of Prussia has almost made it part
of their coronation oath.  Apropos, pray remember that the
Emperor's pavilion is not the Emperor's pavillon; though you
are so far in the right, that he may have a pavilion, but I
don't conceive how he comes by a pavillon.  What Tuscan colours
has he, unless a streamer upon the belfry at Leghorn?  You was
so deep in politics when you wrote your last letter, that it
was almost in cipher, and as I don't happen to have a key to
bad writing, I could not read a word that interests my vanity
extremely-I unravelled enough to learn that a new
governor(1012) of Milan is a great admirer of me, but I could
not guess at one syllable of his name, and it is very
uncomfortable in a dialogue between one's pride and oneself, to
be forced to talk of Governor What-d'ye-call-em, who has so
good a taste.  I think you never can have a more important
occasion for despatching a courier than to tell me Governor -
-'s name.  In the mean time, don't give him any more Strawberry
editions; of some I print very few, they are all begged
immediately, and then you will not have a complete set, as I
wish you to have, notwithstanding all my partiality for the
governor of Milan.  Perhaps, upon the peace I may send him a
set richly bound! I am a little more serious in what I am going
to say; you will oblige me if at your leisure you will pick up
for me all or any little historical tracts that relate to the
house of Medici.  I have some distant thoughts of writing their
history, and at the peace may probably execute what you know I
have long retained in my wish, another journey to Florence.
Stosch, I think, had great collections relating to them; would
they sell a separate part of his library?  Could I get at any
state letters and papers there?  Do think of this; I assure you
I do Thank you for the trouble you have taken about the
Neapolitan books, and for the medals that are coming.

Colonel Campbell and the Duchess of Hamilton are married.  My
sister(1013) who was at the Opera last Tuesday, and went from
thence to a great ball at the Duke of Bridgewater's, where she
stayed till three in the morning, was brought to bed in less
than four hours afterwards of a fifth boy: she has had two
girls, too, and I believe left it entirely to this child to
choose what it would be.  Adieu! my dear Sir.

I am puzzled to know how to deal with you: I hate to be

die at the Vine of mildew, goes against my conscience, Don't it
go against yours to keep all your family there till they are
mouldy?  Instead of sending you a physician, I will send you a
dozen brasiers; I am persuaded that you want to be dried and
aired more than physicked.  For God's sake don't stay there any
longer:--

482 Letter 309
To The Rev. Henry Zouch.
Arlington Street, March 15, 1759.

Sir,
You judge very rightly, Sir, that I do not intend to meddle
with accounts of religious houses; I should not think of them
at all unless I could learn the names of any of the architects,
not of the founders.  It is the history of our architecture
that I should search after, especially the beautiful Gothic.  I
have by no means digested the plan of my intended work.  The
materials I have ready in great quantities in Vertue's MSS.;
but he has collected little with regard to our architects,
except Inigo Jones.  As our painters have been very
indifferent, I must, to make the work interesting, make it
historical; I would mix it with anecdotes of patrons of the
arts, and with dresses and customs from old pictures. something
in the manner of Moulfaucon's Antiquities of France.  I think
it capable of being made a very amusing work, but I don't know
whether I shall ever bestow the necessary time on it.  At
present, even my press is at a stop, my printer, who was a
foolish Irishman, and who took himself for a genius, and who
grew angry when I thought him extremely the former, and not the
least of the latter, has left me, and I have Not yet fixed upon
another.

In what edition, Sir, of Beaumont and Fletcher, is the copy of
verses you mention, signed "Grandison?"(1015)  They are not in
mine.  In my Catalogue I mention the Countess of Montgomery's
Eusebia; I shall be glad to know what her Urania is. I fear you
will find little satisfaction in a library of noble works.  I
have got several, some duplicates, that shall be at your
service if you continue Your collection; but in general they
are mere curiosities.

Mr. Hume has published his History of the House of Tudor.  I
have not advanced far in it, but it appears an inaccurate and
careless, as it certainly has been a very hasty, performance.
Adieu! Sir.

(1015) There has been some mistake here.  Amidst the vast
number of verses to Beaumont and Fletcher, none are found with
this signature.  There is one copy signed Gardiner.-C.



482 Letter 310
To Sir David Dalrymple.(1016)
Strawberry Hill, March 25, 1759.

I should not trouble you, Sir, so soon again with a letter, but
some questions and some passages in yours seem to make it
necessary. I know nothing of the Life of Gustavus, nor heard of
it, before it was advertised.  Mr. Harte(1017) was a favoured
disciple of Mr. Pope, whose obscurity he imitated more than his
lustre.  Of the History of the Revival of Learning I have not
heard a word.  Mr. Gray a few years ago began a poem on that
subject; but dropped it, thinking it would cross too much upon
some parts of the Dunciad.  It would make a signal part of a
History of Learning which I lately proposed to Mr. Robertson.
Since I wrote to him, another subject has started to me, which
would make as agreeable a work, both to the writer and to the
reader, as any I could think of; and would be a very tractable
one, because capable of being extended or contracted as the
author should please.  It is the History of the House of
Medici.(1018)  There is an almost unknown republic, factions,
banishment, murders, commerce, conquests, heroes, cardinals,
all of a new stamp, and very different from what appear in any
other country.  There is a scene of little polite Italian
courts, where gallantry and literature were uncommonly blended,
particularly in that of Urbino, which without any violence
might make an episode.  The Popes on the greater plan enter of
course.  What a morsel Leo the Tenth! the revival of
letters!(1019) the torrent of Greeks that imported them! Extend
still farther, there are Catherine and Mary, Queens of France.
In short, I know nothing one could wish in a subject that would
not fall into this--and then it is a Complete Subject, the
family is extinct: even the state is so, as a separate
dominion.

I could not help smiling, Sir, at being taxed with insincerity
for my encomiums on Scotland.  They were given in a manner a
little too serious to admit of irony, and (as partialities
cannot be supposed entirely ceased) with too much risk of
disapprobation in this part of the world, not to flow from my
heart.  My friends have long known my opinion on this point,
and it is too much formed on fact for me to retract it, if I
were so disposed.  With regard to the magazines and reviews, I
can say with equal and great truth, that I have been much more
hurt at a gross defence of me than by all that railing.

Mallet still defers his life of the Duke of Marlborough;(1020)
I don't know why: sometimes he says he will stay till the
peace; sometimes that he is translating it, or having it
translated into French, that he may not lose that advantage.

(1016) Now first collected.

(1017) Walter Harte was tutor to Mr. Stanhope, Lord
Chesterfield's natural son, and through bis lordship's interest
made canon of Windsor.  Dr. Johnson describes him as a scholar,
and a man of the most companionable talents he had ever known."
"Poor man!" he adds, "he left London the day of the publication
of his book, that he might be out of the way of the great
praise he was to receive; and he was ashamed to return, when he
found how ill his book had succeeded.  It was unlucky in coming
out on the same day with Robertson's History of Scotland." See
Boswell, vol. viii. p. 53.  Lord Chesterfield writes to his
son, on the 30th of March, "Harte's work will, upon the whole,
be a very curious and valuable history.  You will find it
dedicated to one of your acquaintance, who was forced to prune
the luxuriant praises bestowed upon him, and yet has left
enough of all conscience to satisfy a reasonable man."-E.

(1018) It was afterwards written in five volumes in quarto,
from authentic documents furnished by the Great-Duke himself.
It was published in Florence in 1781, and was entitled "Istoria
del Gran Ducato di Toscana sotto il Governo delta Casa Medici,
per Riguccio Galuzzi."-E.

484 Letter 311
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, April 11, 1759.

I have waited and waited, in hopes of sending you the rest of
Martinico or Guadaloupe; nothing else, as you guessed, has
happened, or I should -have told you.  But at present I can
stay no longer, for I, who am a little more expeditious than a
squadron, have made a conquest myself, and in less than a month
since the first thought started.  I hurry to tell you, lest you
should go and consult the map of Middlesex, to see -whether I
have any dispute about boundaries with the neighbouring Prince
of Isleworth, or am likely to have fitted out a secret
expedition upon Hounslow Heath--in short, I have married, that
is, am marrying, my niece Maria,(1021) my brother's second
daughter, to Lord Waldegrave.(1022)  What say you?  A month ago
I was told he liked her.--does he? I jumbled them together, and
he has Already proposed.  For character and credit, he is the
first match in England-for beauty, I think she is.  She has not
a fault in her face and person, and the detail is charming.  A
warm complexion tending to brown, fine eyes, brown hair, fine
teeth, and infinite wit and vivacity.  Two things are odd in
this match; he seems to have been doomed to a Maria Walpole--if
his father had lived, he had married my sister;(1023) and this
is the second of my brother's daughters that has married into
the house of Stuart.  Mr. Keppel(1024) comes from Charles, Lord
Waldegrave from James II.  My brother has luckily been
tractable, and left the whole management to me.  My family
don't lose any rank or advantage, when they let me dispose of
them--a knight of the garter for my niece; 150,000 pounds for
my Lord Orford if he would have taken her;(1025) these are not
trifling establishments.

It were miserable after this to tell you that Prince Ferdinand
has cut to pieces two or three squadrons of Austrians.  I frame
to myself that if I was commander-in-chief.  I should on a
sudden appear in the middle of Vienna, and oblige the Empress
to give an Archduchess with half a dozen provinces to some
infant prince or other, and make a peace before the bread
wagons were come up.  Difficulties are nothing; all depends on
the sphere in which one is placed.

You must excuse my altitudes I feel myself very impertinent
just now, but as I know it, I trust I shall not be more so than
is becoming.

The Dutch cloud is a little dispersed; the privy council have
squeezed out some rays of sunshine by restoring One Of' their
ships, and by adjudging that we captors should prove the
affirmative of contraband goods, instead of the goods proving
themselves so: just as if one was ordered to believe that if a
blackamoor is christened Thomas, he is a white.  These
distinctions are not quite adapted to the meridian of a
flippant English privateer's comprehensions: however, the
murmur is not great yet.  I don't know what may betide if the
minister should order the mob to be angry with the Ministry,
nor whether Mr. Pitt or the mob will speak first.  He is laid
up with the gout, and it is as much as the rest of the
administration can do to prevent his flying out.  I am sorry,
after you have been laying in such bales of Grotius and
Puffendorf, that you must be forced to correct the text by a
Dutch comment.  You shall have the pamphlet you desire, and
Lord Mansfield's famous answer to the Prussian manifesto, (I
don't know whether it is in French,) but you must now read
Hardwickius usum Batavorum.(1026)

We think we have lost Fort St. David, but have some scanty
hopes of a victorious codicil, as our fleet there seems to have
had the superiority.  The King of Spain is certainly not dead,
and the Italian war in appearance is blown over.  This summer,
I think, must finish all war, for who will have men, who will
have money to furnish another campaign?  Adieu!

P. S. Mr. Conway has got the first regiment of dragoons on
Hawley's death.

(1021) Maria, second daughter of Sir Edward Walpole, afterwards
married to William Henry, Duke of Gloucester, brother of King
George III.

(1022) James, second Earl of Waldegrave, knight of the garter,
and governor of George Prince of Wales, afterwards George III.

(1023) Lady Maria Churchill, daughter of Sir Robert Walpole.

(1024) Frederick Keppel, fourth son of William Anne, Earl of
Albemarle, by Lady Anne Lennox, daughter of the first Duke of
Richmond.

(1025) Miss Nichols, afterwards Marchioness of Carnarvon.

485 Letter 312
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, April 26, 1759.

Your brother, your Wetenhalls, and the ancient Baron and
Baroness Dacre of the South, are to dine with me at Strawberry
Hill next Sunday.  Divers have been the negotiations about it:
your sister, you know, is often impeded by a prescription or a
prayer; and I, on the other hand, who never rise in the
morning, have two balls on my hands this week to keep me in bed
the next day till dinner-time.  Well, it is charming to be so
young! the follies of the town are so much more agreeable than
the wisdom of my brethren the authors, that I think for the
future I shall never write beyond a card, nor print beyond Mrs.
Clive's benefit tickets.  Our great match approaches; I dine at
Lord Waldegrave's presently, and suppose I shall then hear the
day.  I have quite reconciled my Lady Townshend to the match
(saving her abusing us all), by desiring her to choose my
wedding clothes; but I am to pay the additional price of being
ridiculous. to which I submit; she has chosen me a white ground
with green flowers.  I represented that, however young my
spirits may be, my bloom is rather past; but the moment I
declared against juvenile colours, I found it was determined I
should have nothing else: so be it. T'other night I had an
uncomfortable situation with the duchess of Bedford: we had
played late at loo at Lady Joan Scot's; I came down stairs with
their two graces of Bedford and Grafton: there was no chair for
me: I said I will walk till I meet one. "Oh!" said the Duchess
of Grafton, "the Duchess of Bedford will set you down:" there
were we charmingly awkward and complimenting: however, she was
forced to press it, and I to accept it; in a minute she spied a
hackney chair--"Oh! there is a chair,-but I beg your pardon, it
looks as if I wanted to get rid of you, but indeed I don't;
only I am afraid the Duke will want his supper."  You may
imagine how much I was afraid of making him wait.  The ball at
Bedford-house, on Monday, was very numerous and magnificent.
The two Princes were there, deep hazard, and the Dutch
deputies, who are a proverb for their dulness: they have
brought with them a young Dutchman, who is the richest man of
Amsterdam.  I am amazed Mr. Yorke has not married him! But the
delightful part of the night was the appearance of the Duke of
Newcastle, who is veering round again, as it is time to betray
Mr. Pitt.  The Duchess(1027) was at the very upper end of the
gallery, and though some of the Pelham court were there too,
yet they showed so little cordiality to this revival of
connexion, that Newcastle had nobody to attend him but Sir
Edward Montagu, who kept pushing him all up the gallery.  From
thence he went into the hazard-room, and wriggle(], and
shuffled, and lisped, and winked, and spied, till he got behind
the Duke of Cumberland, the Duke of Bedford, and Rigby; the
first of whom did not deign to notice him; but he must come to
it.  You would have died to see Newcastle's pitiful and
distressed figure,--nobody went near him: he tried to flatter
people, that were too busy to mind him; in short, he was quite
disconcerted; his treachery used to be so sheathed in folly,
that he was never out of countenance; but it is plain he grows
old.  To finish his confusion and anxiety, George Selwyn,
Brand, and I, went and stood near him, and in half whispers,
that he might hear, said, "Lord, how he is broke! how old he
looks!" then I said, "This room feels very cold: I believe
there never is a fire in it."  Presently afterwards I said,
"Well, I'll not stay here; this room has been washed to-day."
In short, I believe we made him take a double dose of
Gascoign's powder when he went home.  Next night Brand and I
communicated this interview to Lord Temple, who was in agonies;
and yesterday his chariot was seen in forty different parts of
the town.  I take it for granted that Fox will not resist these
overtures, and then we shall have the paymastership, the
secretaryship of Ireland, and all Calcraft's regiments once
more afloat.

May 1.

I did not finish this letter last week, for the picture could
not set out till next Thursday.  Your kin brought Lord
Mandeville with them to Strawberry; he was very civil and
good-humoured, and I trust I was so too.  My nuptialities dined
here yesterday.  The wedding is fixed for the 15th.  The town,
who saw Maria set out in the Earl's coach, concluded it was
yesterday.  He notified his marriage to the Monarch last
Saturday, and it was received civilly.  Mrs. Thornhill is dead,
and I am inpatient to hear the fate of Miss Mildmay.  the
Princes Ferdinand and Henry have been skirmishing, have been
beaten, and have beat, but with no decision.

The ball at Mr. Conolly's(1028) was by no means delightful.
the house is small, it was hot, and was composed Of young
Irish. I was retiring when they went to supper, but was fetched
back to sup with Prince Edward and the Duchess of Richmond, who
is his present passion.  He had chattered as much love to her
as would serve ten balls.  The conversation turned on the
Guardian--most unfortunately the Prince asked her if she should
like Mr. Clackit--"No, indeed, Sir,"  said the Duchess.  Lord
Tavistock(1029) burst out into a loud laugh, and I am afraid
none of the company quite kept their countenances.  Adieu! This
letter is gossiping enough for any Mrs. Clackit, but I know you
love these details.

(1027) Gertrude Duchess of Bedford, daughter of Earl Gower.

(1028) Thomas Conolly, Esq., son of Lady Anne Conolly, sister
of Thomas Earl of Strafford, and who inherited great part of
her brother's property.  Mr. Conolly was married to Lady Louisa
Lenox, sister of the Duke of Richmond, and of Lady Holland.
They died without issue.-E.

(1029) Francis Marquis of Tavistock, only son of John Duke of
Bedford.  He died before his father, in 1767, in consequence of
a fall from his horse when hunting.-E.



487 Letter 313
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, May 10, 1759.

The laurels we began to plant in Guadaloupe do not thrive--we
have taken half the island, and despair of the other half which
we are gone to take.  General Hobson is dead, and many of our
men-it seems all climates are not equally good for
conquest-Alexander and Caesar would have looked wretchedly
after a yellow fever! A hero that would have leaped a rampart,
would perhaps have shuddered at the thought of being scalped.
Glory will be taken in its own way, and cannot reconcile itself
to the untoward barbarism of America. In short, if we don't
renounce expeditions, our history will be a journal of
miscarriages.  What luck must a general have that escapes a
flux, or being shot abroad--or at home! How fatal a war has
this been! From Pondicherry to Canada, from Russia to Senegal,
the world has been a great bill of mortality?  The King of
Prussia does not appear to have tapped his campaign yet--he was
slow last year; it is well if he concludes this as thunderingly
as he did the last.  Our winter-politics are drawn to the
dregs.  The King is gone to Kensington, and the Parliament is
going out of town.  The ministers who don't agree, will, I
believe, let the war decide their squabbles too.  Mr. Pitt will
take Canada and the cabinet-council together, or miscarry in
both.  There are Dutch deputies here, who are likely to be here
some time: their negotiations are not of an epigrammatic
nature. and we are in no hurry to decide on points which we
cannot well give up, nor maintain without inconvenience.  But
it is idle to describe what describes itself by not being
concluded.

I have received yours of the 7th of last month, and fear you
are quite in the right about a history of the house of Medici--
yet it is pity it should not be written!(1030)  You don't, I
know, want any spur to incite you to remember me and any
commission with which I trouble you; and therefore you must not
take it in that light, but as the consequence of my having just
seen the Neapolitan book of Herculaneum, that I mention it to
you again.  Though it is far from being finely engraved, yet
there are bits in It that make me wish much to have it, and if
you could procure it for me, I own I should be pleased.  Adieu!
my dear Sir.

488 Letter 314
To The Rev. Henry Zouch.
Strawberry Hill, May 14, 1759.

Sir,
You accuse me with so much delicacy and with so much seeming
justice, that I must tell you the truth, cost me what it will.
It is in fact, I own, that I have been silent, not knowing what
to say to you, or how not to say something about your desire
that I would attend the affair of the navigation of Calder in
Parliament.  In truth, I scarce ever do attend private business
on solicitation.  If I attend, I cannot help forming an
opinion, and when formed I do not care not to be guided by it,
and at the same time it is very unpleasant to vote against a
person whom one went to serve.  I know nothing of the merits of
the navigation in question, and it would have given me great
pain to have opposed, as it might have happened, a side
espoused by one for whom I had conceived such an esteem as I
have for you, Sir.  I did not tell you my scruples, because you
might have thought them affected, and because, to say the
truth, I choose to disguise them.  I have seen too much of the
parade of conscience to expect that an ostentation of it in me
should be treated with uncommon lenity.  I cannot help having
scruples; I can help displaying them; and now, sir, that I have
made you my confessor, I trust you will keep my secret for my
sake, and give me absolution for what I have committed against
you.

I certainly do propose to digest the materials that Vertue had
collected(1031) relating to English arts; but doubting of the
merit of the subject, as you do, Sir, and not proposing to give
myself much trouble about it, I think, at present, that I shall
still call the work his.  However, at your leisure, I shall be
much obliged to you for any hints.  For nobler or any other
game, I don't think of it; I am sick of the character of
author; I am sick of the consequences of it; I am weary Of
Seeing my name in the newspapers; I am tired with reading
foolish criticisms on me, and as foolish defences of me; and I
trust my friends will be so good as to let the last abuse of me
pass unanswered.  It is called "Remarks" on my Catalogue,
asperses the Revolution more than it does my book, and, in one
word, is written by a non-juring preacher, who was a
dog-doctor.  Of me he knows so little, that he thinks to punish
me by abusing King William! Had that Prince been an author,
perhaps I might have been a little ungentle to him too.  I am
not dupe enough to think that any body wins a crown for the
sake of the people.  Indeed, I am Whig enough to be glad to be
abused; that is, that any body may write what they please; and
though the Jacobites are the only men who abuse outrageously
that liberty of the press which all their labours tend to
demolish, I would not have the nation lose such a blessing for
their impertinences.  That their spirit and projects revive is
certain.  All the histories of England, Hume's, as you observe,
and Smollett's more avowedly, are calculated to whiten the
house of Stuart.  All the magazines are elected to depress
writers of the other side, and as it has been learnt within
these few days, France is preparing an army of
commentators1032) to illustrate the works of those professors.
But to come to what ought to be a particular part of this
letter.  I am very sensible, Sir, to the confidence you place
in me, and shall assuredly do nothing to forfeit it; at the
same time, I must take the liberty you allow me, of making some
objections to your plan.  As your friend, I must object to the
subject.  It is heroic to sacrifice one's own interest to do
good, but I would be sure of doing some before I offered myself
up.  You will make enemies; are you sure you shall make
proselytes?  I am ready to believe you have no ambition now--
but may you not have hereafter? Are bishops corrigible or
placable? Few men are capable of forgiving being told their
faults in private; who can bear being told of them publicly?-
-Then, you propose to write in Latin: that is, you propose to
be read by those only whom you intend to censure, and whose
interest it will be to find faults in your work.  If I proposed
to attack the clergy, I would at least call in the laity to
hear my arguments, and I fear the laity do not much listen to
Latin.  In Short, Sir, I wish much to see something of your
writing, and consequently I wish to see it in a shape in which
it would give me most pleasure.

You will say, that your concealing your name is an answer to
all I have said.  A bad author may be concealed, but then what
good does he do? I am persuaded you would write well-ask your
heart, Sir, if you then would like to conceal yourself.
Forgive my frankness; I am not old, but I have lived long
enough to be sure that I give you good advice.  There -is
lately published a voluminous history of Gustavus Adolphus,
sadly written, yet very amusing from the matter.

(1031) Mr. Walpole, in his dedication of the "Anecdotes of
painting," says, he is rather an Editor than an Author; but
much as he certainly derived from Vertue, his own share in this
interesting work entitles him to the thanks of every lover of
the fine arts, and of British antiquities.-C.

(1032) The French were at this time attempting to play the
farce of invasion.  Flat-bottomed boats were building in all
the ports of Normandy and Brittany, calculated to transport an
army of a hundred thousand men.-C.



489 Letter 315
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, May 16, 1759.

I packed up a long letter to you in the case with the Earl of
Manchester, which I suppose did not arrive at Greatworth before
you left it.  Don't send for it, for there are private
histories in it, that should not travel post, and which will be
full as new to you a month hence.

Well! Maria was married yesterday.  Don't we manage well!  the
original day was not once put off: lawyers and milliners were
all ready canonically.  It was as sensible a wedding as ever
was.  There was neither form nor indecency, both which
generally meet on such occasions.  They were married at my
brother's in Pall-Mall, just before dinner, by Mr. Keppel; the
company, my brother, his son, Mrs. Keppel, and Charlotte, Lady
Elizabeth Keppel, Lady Betty Waldegrave, and I. We dined there;
the Earl and new Countess got into their postchaise at eight
o'clock, and went to Navestock alone, where they stay till
Saturday night: on Sunday she is to be presented, and to make
my Lady Coventry distracted, who, t'other day, told Lady Anne
Connolly how she dreaded Lady Louisa's arrival; "But," said
she, "now I have seen her, I am easy."

Maria was in a white silver gown, with a hat pulled very much
over her face; what one could see of it was handsomer than
ever; a cold maiden blush gave her the sweetest delicacy in the
world.  I had liked to have demolished the solemnity of the
ceremony by laughing, when Mr. Keppel read the words, "Bless
thy servant and thy handmaid;" it struck me how ridiculous it
would have been, had Miss Drax been the handmaid, as she was
once to have been.

Did I ever tell you what happened at my Lord Hertford's
wedding?  You remember that my father's style was not purity
itself.  As the bride was so young and so exceedingly bashful,
and as my Lord Hertford is a little of the prude himself, great
means were used to keep Sir Robert within bounds.  He yawned,
and behaved decently.  When the dessert was removed, the
Bishop, who married them, said, "Sir Robert, what health shall
we drink?"  It was just after Vernon's conquest of Porto Bello.
"I don't know," replied my father: "why, drink the admiral in
the straights of Bocca Cieca."

We have had a sort of debate in the House of Commons on the
bill for fixing the augmentation of the salaries of the judges:
Charles Townshend says, the book of Judges was saved by the
book of Numbers.

Lord Weymouth(1033) is to be married on Tuesday, or, as he said
himself, to be turned off.  George Selwyn told him he wondered
that he had not been turned off before, for he still sits up
drinking all night and gaming.

Well! are you ready to be invaded? for it seems invasions from
France are coming into fashion again.  A descent on Ireland at
least is expected.  There has been a great quarrel -between Mr.
Pitt and Lord Anson, on the negligence of the latter.  I
suppose they will be reconciled by agreeing to hang some
admiral, who will come too late to save Ireland, after it is
impossible to save it.

Dr. Young has published a new book,(1034) on purpose. he says
himself, to have an opportunity of telling a story that he has
known these forty years.  Mr. Addison sent for the young Lord
Warwick, as he was dying, to show him in what peace a Christian
could die--unluckily he died of brandy-nothing makes a
Christian die in peace like being maudlin! but don't say this
in Gath, where you are.  Adieu!

P. S. I forgot to tell you two good stories of the little
Prince Frederick.  He was describing to Lady Charlotte Edwin
the eunuchs of the Opera; but not easily finding proper words,
he said, "I can't tell you, but I will show you how they make
them," and began to unbutton.  T'other day as he was with the
Prince of Wales, Kitty Fisher passed by, and the child named
her; the Prince, to try him, asked who that was?  "Why, a
Miss."  "A Miss," said the Prince of Wales; "why, are not all
girls Misses?"  "Oh! but a particular sort of Miss--a Miss that
sells oranges."  "Is there any harm in selling oranges?"  "Oh!
but they are not such oranges as you buy; I believe they are a
sort that my brother Edward buys."

(1033) Afterwards created Marquis of Bath.  He married Lady
Elizabeth Cavendish Bentinck, daughter of William, third Duke
of Portland.-E.

author of Sir Charles Grandison."  The article on this work in
the Critical Review was written by Oliver Goldsmith.  See the

491 Letter 316
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, June 1, 1759.

I have not announced to you in form the invasion from France,
of which all our newspapers have been so full, nor do I tell
you every time the clock strikes.  An invasion frightens one
but once.  I am grown to fear no invasions but those we make.
Yet I believe there are people really afraid of this--I mean
the new militia, who have received orders to march.  The war in
general seems languishing: Prince Henry of Prussia is the only
one who keeps it up with any spirit.  The Parliament goes into
the country to-morrow.

One of your last friends, Lord Northampton,(1035) is going to
marry Lady Anne Somerset, the Duke of Beaufort's sister.  She
is rather handsome.  He seems to have too much of the coldness
and dignity of the Comptons.

Have you had the comet in Italy?  It has made more noise here
than it deserved, because Sir Isaac Newton foretold it, and it
came very near disappointing him.  Indeed, I have a notion that
it is not the right, but a little one- that they put up as they
were hunting the true--in short, I suppose, like pine-apples
and gold pheasants, comets will grow so common as to be sold at
Covent-garden market.

I am glad you approve the marriage of my charming niece--she is
now Lady Waldegrave in all the forms.

I envy you who can make out whole letters to me--I find it grow
every day more difficult, we are so far and have been so long
removed from little events in common that serve to fill up a
correspondence, that though my heart is willing, my hand is
slow.  Europe is a dull magnificent subject to one who cares
little and thinks still les about Europe.  Even the King of
Prussia, except on post-days don't
occupy a quarter of an inch in my memory.  He must kill a
hundred thousand men once a fortnight to Put me in mind of him.
Heroes that do so much in a book, and seem so active to
posterity, lie fallow a vast while to their contemporaries--and
how it would humble a vast Prince who expects to occupy the
whole attention of an age, to hear an idle man in his easy
chair cry "Well! why don't the King of Prussia do something?"
If one means to make a lasting bustle, one should contrive to
be the hero of a village; I have known a country rake talked of
for a riot, whole years after the battle of Blenheim has grown
obsolete.  Fame, like an essence, the farther it is diffused,
the sooner it vanishes.  The million in London devour an event
and demand another to-morrow.  Three or four families in a
hamlet twist and turn it, examine, discuss, mistake, repeat
their mistake, remember their mistake, and teach it to their
children.  Adieu!

(1035) Charles Compton, seventh Earl of Northampton, married
Lady Anne Somerset, daughter of Charles, fourth Duke of
beaufort; by whom he had an only Child, Lady Elizabeth Compton,
married to Lord George Henry Cavendish, now Earl of Burlington.
Lord Northampton died in 1763.-D.



492 Letter 317
To George Montagu, Esq.
June 2, 1759.

Strawberry Hill is grown a perfect Paphos; it is the land of
beauties.  On Wednesday the Duchesses of Hamilton and Richmond
and Lady Ailesbury dined there; the two latter stayed all
night.  There never was so pretty a sight as to see them all
three sitting in the shell; a thousand years hence, when I
begin to grow old, if that can ever be, I shall talk of that
event, and tell young people how much handsomer the women of my
time were than they will be then: I shall say, "Women alter
now; I remember Lady Ailesbury looking handsomer than her
daughter, the pretty Duchess of Richmond, as they were sitting
in the shell on my terrace with the Duchess of Hamilton, one of
the famous Gunnings."  Yesterday t'other more famous
Gunning(1036) dined there.  She has made a friendship with my
charming niece, to disguise her jealousy of the new Countess's
beauty: there were they two, their lords, Lord Buckingham, and
Charlotte.  You will think that I did not choose men for my
parties so well as women.  I don't include Lord Waldegrave in
this bad election.

Loo is mounted to its zenith; the parties last till one and two
in the morning.  We played at Lady Hertford's last week, the
last night of her lying-in, till deep into Sunday morning,
after she and her lord were retired.  It Is now adjourned to
Mrs. Fitzroy's, whose child the town called "Pam--ela'.  I
proposed, that instead of receiving cards for assemblies, one
should send in a morning to Dr. Hunter's, the man-midwife, to
know where there is loo that evening.  I find poor Charles
Montagu is dead:(1037) is it true, as the papers say, that his
son comes into Parliament? The invasion is not half so much in
fashion as loo, and the King demanding the assistance of' the
militia does not add much dignity to it.  The great Pam of
Parliament, who made the motion, entered into a wonderful
definition of the several sorts of fear; from fear that comes
from pusillanimity, up to fear from magnanimity.  It put me in
mind of that wise Pythian, My Lady Londonderry, who, when her
sister, Lady DOnnegal was dying, pronounced, that if it were a
fever from a fever, she would live; but if it were a fever from
death, she would die.

Mr. Mason has published another drama, called Caractacus; there
are some incantations poetical enough, and odes so Greek as to
have very little meaning.  But the whole is laboured,
uninteresting, and no more resembling the manners of Britons
than of Japanese.  It is introduced by a piping elegy; for
Mason, in imitation of Gray, "will cry and roar all
night"(1038) without the least provocation.

Adieu! I shall be glad to hear that your Strawberry tide is
fixed.

(1037) Only son of the Hon.  James Montagu, son of Henry Earl
of Manchester.-E.

493 Letter 318
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 8, 1759.

This is merely a letter about your commission, and I hope it
will get to you with wondrous haste.  I have not lost a minute
in trying to execute what you desire, but it is impossible to
perform all that is required.  A watch, perfect by Ellicot or
Gray, with all the accompaniments, cannot possibly be had for
near seventy-five pounds.  Though the directions do not
expressly limit me to seventy-five, yet I know Italians enough
to be sure that when they name seventy-five, they would not
bear a codicil of fifty-five more.  Ellicot (and Gray is rather
dearer) would have for watch and chain a hundred and
thirty-four guineas; the seals will cost sixteen more.  Two
hundred and sixty-eight sequins are more than I dare lay out.
But I will tell you what I have done: Deard, one of the first
jewellers and toymen Here, has undertaken to make a watch and
chain, enamelled according to a pattern I have chosen of the
newest kind, for a hundred guineas; with two seals for sixteen
more; and he has engaged that, if this is not approved, he will
keep it himself; but to this I must have an immediate answer.
He will put his own name to it, as a warrant to the goodness of
the work; and then, except the nine of Ellicot or Gray, your
friend will have as good a watch as he can desire.  I take for
granted, at farthest, that I can have an answer by the 15th of
July; and then there will be time, I trust, to convey it to
you; I suppose by sea, for unless a fortunate messenger should
be going `a point nomm`e, you may imagine that a traveller
would not arrive there in any time.  My dear Sir, you know how
happy I am to do any thing you desire; and I shall pique myself
on your credit in this, but your friend has expected what,
altogether, it is almost impossible to perform--what can be
done, shall be.

There is not a syllable of news--if there was, I should not
confine myself solely to the commission.  Some of our captains
in the East Indies have behaved very ill; if there is an
invasion, which I don't believe there will, I am glad they were
not here.  Adieu!



494 Letter 319
To The Earl Of Strafford.
Strawberry Hill, June 12, 1759.

My dear lord,
After so kind a note as you left for me at your going Out Of
town, you cannot wonder that I was determined to thank you the
moment I knew you settled in Yorkshire.  At least I am not
ungrateful, if I deserve your goodness by no other title.  I
was willing to stay till I could amuse you, but I have not a
battle big enough even to send in a letter.  A war that reaches
from Muscovy to Alsace, and from Madras to California, don't
produce an article half so long as Mr. Johnson's riding three
horses at Once.  The King of Prussia's campaign is still. in
its papillotes; Prince Ferdinand is laid up like the rest of
the pensioners on Ireland; Guadaloupe has taken a sleeping-
draught, and our heroes in America seem to be planting suckers
of laurels that will not make any future these three years.
All the war that is in fashion lies between those two
ridiculous things, an invasion and the militia. - Prince Edward
is going to sea, to inquire after the invasion from France: and
the old potbellied country colonels are preparing to march and
make it drunk when it comes.  I don't know, as it is an event
in Mr. Pitt's administration, whether the Jacobite
corporations, who are converted by his eloquence which they
never heard, do not propose to bestow their freedom on the
first corps of French that shall land.

Adieu, my lord and my lady! I hope you are all beauty and
verdure.  We are drowned with obtaining ours.



495 Letter 320
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, June 22, 1759.

Well! they tell us in good earnest that we are to be invaded;
Mr. Pitt is as positive of it as of his own invasions.  As the
French affect an air of grandeur in all they do, "Mr. Pitt sent
ten thousands, but they send fifty thousands."  You will be
inquisitive after our force--I can't tell you the particulars;
I am only in town for to-day, but I hear of mighty
preparations.  Of one thing I am sure; they missed the moment
when eight thousand men might have carried off England and set
it down in the gardens of Versailles.  In the last war, when we
could not rake together four thousand men, and were all
divided, not a flat-bottomed boat lifted up its leg against us!
There is great spirit in Motion; my Lord Orford is gone with
his Norfolk militia to Portsmouth; every body is raising
regiments or themselves--my Lord Shaftsbury,(1039) . one of the
new colonels of militia, is to be a brigadier-general.  I shall
not march my Twickenham militia for some private reasons; my
farmer has got an ague, my printer has run away, my footboy is
always drunk, and my gardener is a Scotchman, and I believe
would give intelligence to the enemy.  France has notified the
Dutch that she intends to -surprise us; and this makes us still
more angry.  In the mean time, we have got Guadaloupe to play
with.  I did not send you any particulars, for this time the
Gazette piqued itself upon telling its own story from beginning
to end; I never knew it so full of chat.  It is very
comfortable, that if we lose our own island, we shall at least
have all America to settle in.  Quebec is to be conquered by
the 15th of July, and two more expeditions, I don't know
whither, are to be crowned with all imaginable success, I don't
know when; so you see our affairs, upon the whole, are in a
very prosperous train.  Your friend, Colonel Clavering, is the
real hero of Guadaloupe; he is come home, covered "with more
laurels than a boar's head: indeed he has done exceedingly
well.  A much older friend of yours is just dead, my Lady
Murray;(1040) she caught her death by too strict attendance on
her sister, Lady Binning, who has been ill.  They were a family
of love, and break their hearts for her.  She had a thousand
good qualities; but no mortal was ever so surprised as I when I
was first told that she was the nymph Arthur Gray would have
ravished.  She had taken care to guard against any more such
danger by more wrinkles than ever twisted round a human face.
Adieu! If you have a mind to be fashionable, you must raise a
regiment of Florentine militia.

have lived at her grandfather's, Lord Marchmont."-E.]



496 Letter 321
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, June 23, 1759.

As you bid me fix a day about six weeks from the date of your
last, it will suit me extremely to see you here the 1st of
August.  I don't mean to treat you with a rowing for a badge,
but it will fall in very commodely between my parties.  You
tell me nothing of the old house you were to see near Blenheim:
I have some suspicion that Greatworth is coming into play
again.  I made your speeches to Mr. Chute, and to Mr. M`untz,
and to myself; your snuff-box is bespoke, your pictures not
done, the print of Lady Waldegrave not begun.

news there are none, unless you have a mind for a panic about
the invasion.  I was in town yesterday, and saw a thousand
people at Kensington with faces as long as if it was the last
accession of this family that they were ever to See.  The
French are coming with fifty thousand men, and we shall meet
them with fifty addresses.  Pray, if you know how, frighten
your neighbours, and give them courage at the same time.

My Lady Coventry and my niece Waldegrave have been mobbed in
the Park.  I am sorry the people of England take all their
liberty out in insulting pretty women.

You will be diverted with what happened to Mr. Meynell lately.
He was engaged to dine at a formal old lady's, but stayed so
late hunting that he had not time to dress, but -went as he
was, with forty apologies.  The matron very affected, and
meaning to say something very civil, cried, "Oh! Sir, I assure
you I can see the gentleman through a pair of buckskin breeches
as well as if he was in silk or satin."

I am sure I can't tell you any thing better, so good night!
Yours ever.

P. s. I hope you have as gorgeous weather as we have; it is
even hot enough for Mr. Bentley.  I live upon the water.



497 Letter 322
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, July 8, 1759.

This will be the most indecisive of all letters: I don't write
to tell you that the French are not landed at Deal, as was
believed yesterday.  An officer arrived post in the middle of
the night, who saw them disembark.  The King was called; my
lord Ligonier buckled on his armour.  Nothing else was talked
of in the streets; yet there was no panic.(1041)  Before noon,
it was known that the invasion was a few Dutch hoys.  The day
before, it was triumph.  Rodney was known to be before Havre de
Grace; with two bomb-ketches he set the town on fire in
different places, and had brought up four more to act,
notwithstanding a very smart fire from the forts, which,
however, will probably force him to retire without burning the
flat-bottomed boats, which are believed out of his reach.  The
express came from him on Wednesday morning.  This is Sunday
noon, and I don't know that farther intelligence is arrived.  I
am sorry for this sort of war, not only for the sufferers, but
I don't like the precedent, in case the French should land.  I
think they will scarce venture; for besides the force on land,
we have a mighty chain of fleet and frigates along the coast.
There is great animosity to them, and few can expect to return.

Our part of the war in Germany seems at an end: Prince
Ferdinand is retiring, and has all the advantage of that part
of great generalship, a retreat.  From America we expect the
greatest things; our force there by land and sea is vast.  I
hope we shall not be to buy England back by restoring the North
Indies! I will gladly give them all the hundred thousand acres
that may fall to my share on the Olio for my twenty acres here.
Truly I don't like having them endangered for the limits of
Virginia!

I wait impatiently for your last orders for the watch; if the
worst comes to the worst, I can convey it to you by some French
officer.

The weather is sultry; this country never looked prettier.  I
hope our enemies will not have the heart to spoil it! It would
be much disappointment to me, who am going to make great
additions to my castle; a gallery, a round tower, and a
cabinet, that is to have all the air of a Catholic chapel--bar
consecration.  Adieu! I will tell you more soon, or I hope no
more.

(1041) "Every body," says Gray, in a letter to Dr. Wharton, of
the 21st, "continues as quiet about the invasion as if a
Frenchman, as soon as he set his foot on our coast, would die,
like a toad in Ireland.  Yet the King's tents and equipage are
ordered to be ready at an hour's warning." Works, vol. iii. p.
218.-E.



498 Letter 323
To Sir David Dalrymple.(1042)
Strawberry Hill, July 11, 1759.

You will repent, Sir, I fear, having drawn such a correspondent
upon yourself.  An author flattered and encouraged is not
easily shaken- off again; but if the interests of my book did
not engage me to trouble you, while you are so good as to write
me the most entertaining letters in the world, it is very
natural for me to lay snares to inveigle more of them.
However, Sir, excuse me this once, and I will be more modest
for the future in trespassing on your kindness.  Yet, before I
break out on my new wants, it will be but decent, Sir, to
answer some particulars of your letter.

I have lately read Mr. Goodall,S(1043) book.  There is
certainly ingenuity in parts 'of his defence: but I believe one
seldom thinks a defence ingenious without meaning that it is
unsatisfactory.  His work left me fully convinced of what he
endeavoured to disprove; and showed me, that the piece you
mention is not the only one that he has written against
moderation.

I have lately got Lord Cromerty's Vindication of the legitimacy
of King Robert,(1044) and his Synopsis Apocalyptica, and thank
you much, Sir, for the notice of any of his pieces.  But if you
expect that his works should lessen my esteem for the writers
of Scotland, you Will please to recollect, that the letter
which paints Lord Cromerty's pieces in so ridiculous a light,
is more than a counterbalance in favour of the writers of your
country: and of all men living, Sir, you are the last who will
destroy my partiality for Scotland.

There is another point, Sir, on which, with all your address,
you will persuade me as little.  Can I think that we want
writers of history while Mr. Hume and Mr. Robertson are living?
It is a truth, and not a compliment, that I never heard
objections made to Mr. Hume's History without endeavouring to
convince the persons who found fault wit@ it, of its great
merit and beauty; and for what I saw of Mr. -Robertson's work,
it is one of the purest styles, and of the greatest
impartiality, that I ever read.  It is impossible for me to
recommend a subject to him: because I cannot judge of what
materials he can obtain.  His present performance will
undoubtedly make him so well known and esteemed, that he will
have credit to obtain many new lights for a future history; but
surely those relating to his own country will always lie most
open to him.  This is much my way of thinking with regard to
myself.  Though the Life of Christina is a pleasing and a most
uncommon subject, yet, totally unacquainted as I am with Sweden
and its language, how could I flatter myself with saying any
thing new of her?  And when original letters and authentic
papers shall hereafter appear, may not they contradict half one
should relate on the authority of what is already published?
for though memoirs written nearest to the time are likely to be
the truest, those published nearest to it are generally the
falsest.

But, indeed, Sir, I am now making you only civil excuses; the
real one is, I have no kind of intention of continuing to
write.  I could not expect to succeed again with so much
luck,--indeed, I think it so,--as I have done; it Would mortify
me more now, after a little success, to be despised, than it
would have done before; and if I could please as much as I
should wish to do, I think one should dread being a voluminous
author.  My own idleness, too, bids me desist.  If I continued,
I should certainly take more pains than I did in my Catalogue;
the trouble would not only be more than I care to encounter,
but would probably destroy what I believe the only merit of my
last work, the ease.  If I could incite you to tread in steps
which I perceive you don't condemn, and for which it is evident
you are so well qualified, from your knowledge, the grace,
facility, and humour of your expression and manner, I shall
have done a real service, where I expected at best to amuse.

499 Letter 324
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, July 19, 1759.

Well, I begin to expect you; you must not forget the first of
August.  If we do but look as well as we do at present, you
will own Strawberry is still in its bloom.  With English
verdure, we have had an Italian summer, and

Whatever sweets Sabaean springs disclose,
Our Indian jasmin, and the Persian rose.

I am forced to talk of Strawberry, lest I should weary you with
what every body wearies me, the French and the militia.  They,
I mean the latter only, not the former, passed just by us
yesterday, and though it was my own clan, I had not the
curiosity to go and see them.  The crowds in Hyde Park, when
the King reviewed them, were unimaginable.  My Lord Orford,
their colonel, I hear, looked gloriously martial and genteel,
and I believe it;(1045) his person and air have a noble
wildness in them; the regiments, too, are very becoming,
scarlet faced with black, buff waistcoats, and gold buttons.
How knights of shires, who have never shot any thing but
woodcocks, like this warfare, I don't know; but the towns
through which they pass adore them; every where they are
treated and regaled.  The Prince of Wales followed them to
Kingston, and gave fifty guineas among the private men.

I expect some anecdotes from you of the coronation at Oxford; I
hear my Lord Westmoreland's own retinue was all be-James'd with
true-blue ribands; and that because Sir William Calvert, who
was a fellow of a college, and happened to be Lord Mayor,
attended the Duke of Newcastle at his inthronization, they
dragged down the present Lord Mayor to Oxford, who is only a
dry-salter.

I have your Butler's posthumous works.(1046)  The poetry is
most uncouth and incorrect, but with infinite wit; especially
one thing on plagiaries is equal to any thirty in Hudibras.
Have you read my Lord Clarendon's? I am enchanted with it; 'tis
very incorrect, but I think more entertaining than his History.
It makes me quite out of humour with other memoirs.  Adieu!

500 Letter 325
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, July 26, 1759.

I am dying in a hot street, with my eyes full of dust, and my
table full of letters to be answered--yet I must write you a
line.  I am sorry your first of Augustness is disordered; I'll
tell you why.  I go to Ragley on the twelfth.  There is to be a
great party at loo for the Duchess of Grafton, and thence they
adjourn to the Warwick races.  I have been engaged so long to
this, that I cannot put it off; besides, I am under
appointments at George Selwyn's, etc. afterwards.  If you
cannot come before all this to let me have enough of your
company, I should wish you to postpone it to the first of
September, when I shall be at leisure for ten or twelve days,
and could go with you from Strawberry to the Vine; but I could
like to know certainly, for as I never make any of my visits
while Strawberry is in bloom, I am a little crowded with them
at the end of the season.

I came this morning in all this torrent of heat from Lord
Waldegrave's at Navestock.  It is a dull place, though it does
not want prospect backwards.  The garden is small, consisting
of two French all`ees of old limes, that are comfortable, two
groves that are not so, and a green canal; there is besides a
paddock.  The house was built by his father, and ill finished,
but an air seigneurial in the furniture; French glasses in
quantities, handsome commodes, tables, screens, etc. goodish
pictures in rich frames, and a deal of noblesse `a la St.
Germain--James the Second, Charles the Second, the Duke of
Berwick, her Grace of Buckingham, the Queen Dowager in the
dress she visited Madame Maintenon, her daughter the Princess
Louisa, a Lady Gerard that died at Joppa, returning from a
pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and above all La Goqfrey, and not at
all ugly, Though she does not show her thighs.  All this is
leavened with the late King, the present King, and Queen
Caroline.  I shall take care to sprinkle a little unholy water
from our well.

I am very sorry you have been so ill; take care of yourself.
there are wicked sore-throats in vogue; poor Lady Essex and
Mrs. Charles Yorke died of them in an instant.

Do let me have a line, and do fix a day; for instead of keeping
me at home one by fixing it, you will keep me there five or six
days by not fixing it.  Adieu!



501 letter 326
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, August 1, 1759.

I have received your two letters about the watch, the first
came with surprising celerity.  I wish, when the watch is
finished, I may be able to convey it to you with equal
expedition.

Nothing is talked of here, as you may imagine, but the
invasion--yet I don't grow more credulous.  Their ridiculous
lists of fifty thousand men don't contribute to frighten me--
nay, though they specify the numbers of apothecaries and
chaplains that are to attend.  Fifty thousand men cannot easily
steal a march over the sea.  Sir Edward Hawke will take care of
them till winter, and by that time we shall have a great force
at land.  The very militia is considerable: the spirit, or at
least the fashion of it, catches every day.  We are growing
such ancient Britons, that I don't know whether I must not
mount some popguns upon the battlements of my castle, lest I
should not be thought hero enough in these West-Saxon times.
Lord Pulteney has done handsomely, and what is more surprising,
so has his father.  The former has offered to raise a regiment,
and to be only lieutenant-colonel, provided the command is
given to a Colonel Crawford, an old soldier, long postponed--
Lord Bath is at the expense, which will be five thousand
pounds.  All the country squires are in regimentals --a
pedestal is making for little Lord Mountford, that he may be
placed at the head of the Cambridgeshire militia.  In short, we
have two sorts of armies, and I hope neither will be
necessary--what the consequences of this militia may be
hereafter, I don't know.  Indifferent I think it cannot be.  A
great force upon an old plan, exploded since modern
improvements, must make some confusion.  If they do not become
ridiculous, which the real officers are disposed to make them,
the crown or the disaffected will draw considerable
consequences, I think, from an establishment popular by being
constitutional, and of great weight from the property it will
contain.

If the French pursue their vivacity in Germany, they will send
us more defenders; our eight thousand men there seem of very
little use.  Both sides seem in all parts weary of the war; at
least are grown so cautious, that a battle will be as great a
curiosity in a campaign as in the midst of peace.  For the
Russians, they quite make one smile; they hover every summer
over the north of Germany, get cut to pieces by September,
disappear, have a general disgraced, and in winter out comes a
memorial of the Czarina's steadiness to her engagements, and of
the mighty things she will do in spring.  The Swedes follow
them like Sancho Panza, and are rejoiced at not being bound by
the laws of chivalry to be thrashed too.

We have an evil that threatens us more nearly than the French.
The heat of the weather has produced a contagious sore-throat
in London.  Mr. Yorke, the solicitor-general, has lost his
wife, his daughter, and a servant.  The young Lady Essex(1047)
died of it in two days.  Two servants are dead in
Newcastle-house, and the Duke has left it; any body else would
be pitied, but his terrors are sure of being a joke.(1048)  My
niece, Lady Waldegrave, has done her part for repairing this
calamity, and is breeding.


Your Lord Northampton has not acted a much more gallant part by
his new mistress than by his fair one at Florence.  When it was
all agreed, he refused to marry unless she had eighteen
thousand pounds.  Eight were wanting.  It looked as if he was
more attached to his old flame than to his new one; but her
uncle, Norborne Berkeley,(1049) has nobly made up the
deficiency.

I told Mr. Fox of the wine that is coming, and he told me what
I had totally forgot, that he has left off Florence, and
chooses to have no more.  He will take this parcel, but you
need not trouble yourself again.  Adieu! my dear Sir, don't let
Marshal Botta terrify you: when the French dare not stir out of
any port they have, it will be extraordinary if they venture to
come into the heart of us.

(1047) Frances, eldest daughter of Sir Charles Hanbury
Williams.  See ant`e, p. 216, letter 108.-E.

(1048) "I have heard the Duke of Newcastle is much broke ever
since his sister Castlecorner died; not that he cared for her,
or saw her above once a year: but she was the last of the brood
that was left; and he now goes regularly to church, which he
never did before." Gray, Works, vol. iii. p. 218.-E.

(1049) Brother of the Duchess of Beaufort, mother of Lady Anne
Somerset, whom Lord Northampton did marry. (Norborne Berkeley

502 Letter 327
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Aug. 8, 1759.

If any body admires expedition, they should address themselves
to you and me, who order watches, negotiate about them by
couriers, and have them finished, with as little trouble as if
we had nothing to do, but, like the men of business in the
Arabian tales, rub a dark lantern, a genie appears, one
bespeaks a bauble worth two or three Indies, and finds it upon
one's table the next morning at breakfast.  The watch was
actually finished, and delivered to your brother yesterday.  I
trust to our good luck for finding quick conveyance.  I did
send to the White@horse cellar here in Piccadilly, whence all
the stage-coaches set out, but there was never a genie booted
and spurred, and going to Florence on a sunbeam.  If you are
not charmed with the watch, never deal with us devils any more.
If any thing a quarter so pretty was found in Herculaneum, One
should admire Roman enamellers more than their Scipios and
Caesars.  The device of the second seal I stole; it is old, but
uncommon; a Cupid standing on two joined hands over the sea; si
la foy manque, l'amour perira--I hope for the honour of the
device. it will arrive before half the honeymoon is over!--But,
alack! I forget the material point; Mr. Deard, who has forty
times more virtue than if he had been taken from the plough to
be colonel of the militia, instead of one hundred and sixteen
pounds to which I pinned him down, to avoid guineas, will
positively take but one hundred and ten pounds.  I did all I
could to corrupt him with six more, but he is immaculate--and
when our posterity is abominably bad, as all posterity always
is till it grows one's ancestors, I hope Mr. Deard's integrity
will be quoted to them as an instance of the virtues that
adorned the simple and barbarous age of George the Second.  Oh!
I can tell you the age of George the Second is likely to be
celebrated for more primitivity than the disinterestedness of
Mr. Deard-here is such a victory come over that--it can't get
over.  Mr. Yorke has sent word that a Captain Ligonier is
coming from Prince Ferdinand to tell us that his Serene
Highness has beaten Monsieur Contades to such a degree, that
every house in London is illuminated, every street has two
bonfires, every bonfire has two hundred squibs, and the poor
charming moon yonder, that never looked so well in her life, is
not at all minded, but seems only staring out of a garret
window at the frantic doings all over the town.(1050)  We don't
know a single particular, but we conclude that Prince Ferdinand
received all his directions from my Lord Granby, who is the
mob's hero.  We are a little afraid, if we could fear any thing
to-night, that the defeat of the Russians by General Weidel was
a mistake for this victory of Prince Ferdinand.  Pray Heaven!
neither of these glories be turned sour, by staying so long at
sea!  You said in your last, what slaughter must be committed
by the end of August!  Alas! my dear Sir, so there is by the
beginning of it; and we, wretched creatures, are forced to be
glad of it, because the greatest part falls on our enemies.

Fifteen hundred men have stolen from Dunkirk, and are said to
be sailed northward--some think, to Embden--too poor a pittance
surely where they thought themselves so superior, unless they
meaned to hinder our receiving our own troops from thence--as
paltry, too, if this is their invasion--but if to Scotland, not
quite a joke.  However, Prince Ferdinand seems to have found
employment for the rest of their troops, and Monsieur de Botta
will not talk to you in so high a style.

D'Aubreu, the pert Spanish minister, said the other day at
court to poor Alt, the Hessian, "Monsieur, je vous f`elicite;
Munster est pris."  Mr. Pitt, who overheard this cruel
apostrophe, called out, "Et moi, Monsieur Alt, Je vous
f`elicite; les Russes sont battus."

I am here in town almost every day; Mrs. Leneve, who has long
lived with my father, and with me, is at the point of death;
she is seventy-three, and has passed twenty-four of them in
continual ill health; so I can but wish her released.  Her long
friendship with our family makes this attention a duty;
otherwise I should certainly not be in town this most gorgeous
of all summers! I should like to know in how many letters this
wonderful summer has been talked of.

It is above two years, I think, since you sent home any of my
letters--will you by any convenient opportunity?

Adieu! There is great impatience, as you may believe, to learn
the welfare of our young lords and heroes--there are the Duke
of Richmond, Lord Granby, Lord George Sackville, Lord Downe,
Fitzroy, General Waldegrave, and others of rank.

(1050) "I have the joy to tell you," writes Mr. Pitt, on the
6th, to Lady Hester, "that our happy victory ne fait que
croitre et embellir: by letters come this day, the hereditary
Prince, with his troops, had passed the Weser, and attacked,
with part of them, a body of six thousand French, defeated it,
took many prisoners, some trophies and
cannon: M. de Contades's baggage, coaches, mules, letters, and
correspondences have fallen into our hands.  Words in letters
say, 'qu'on se lasse de prendre des prisoniers.'"  Chatham

504 Letter 328
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Aug. 9, 1759.

Unless your Colonel Johnson is a man of no note, he is well.
for we have not lost one officer of any note--now will you
conclude that we are beaten, and will be crying and roaring all
night for Hanover.  Lord! where do you live? If you had any
ears, as I have none left with the noise, you would have heard
the racket that was made from morning till night yesterday on
the news of the victory(1051) gained by Prince Ferdinand over
the French.  He has not left so many alive as there are at any
periwig-maker's in London.  This is all we know, the
particulars are to come at their leisure, and with all the
gravity due to their importance.  If the King's heart were not
entirely English, I believe he would be complimented with the
title of Germanicus from the name of the country where this
great event happened; for we don't at all know the precise
spot, nor has the battle yet been christened--all that is
certain is, that the poor Duke(1052) is neither father nor
godfather.

I was sent for to town yesterday, as Mrs. Leneve was at the
point of death: but she has had a surprising change, and may
linger on still.  I found the town distracted, and at night it
was beautiful beyond description.  As the weather was so hot,
every window was open, and all the rails illuminated; every
street had one or two bonfires, the moon was in all its glory,
the very middle of the streets crowded with officers and people
of fashion talking of the news.  Every squib in town got drunk,
and rioted about the streets till morning.  Two of our
regiments are said to have suffered much, of which Napier's
most.  Adieu! If you should be over-English with this, there is
a party of one thousand five hundred men stolen out of Dunkirk,
that some weeks hence may bring you to your senses again,
provided they are properly planted and watered in Scotland.

(1051) At the battle of Minden.

(1052) Duke of Cumberland.



505 Letter 329
To The Earl Of Strafford.
Strawberry Hill, Thursday, 3 o'clock, August 9, 1759.

My dear lord,
Lord Granby has entirely defeated the French!--The foreign
gazettes, I suppose, will give this victory to Prince
Ferdinand: but the mob of London, whom I have this minute left,
and who must know best, assure me that it is all their own
Marquis's doing.  Mr. Yorke(1053) was the first to send this
news, "to be laid with himself and all humility at his
Majesty's feet",(1054) about eleven o'clock yesterday morning.
At five this morning came Captain Ligonier, who was despatched
in such a hurry that he had not time to pack up any particulars
in his portmanteau: those we are expecting with our own army,
who we conclude are now at Paris, and will be tomorrow night at
Amiens.  All we know is, that not one Englishman is killed, nor
one Frenchman left alive.  If you should chance to meet a
bloody wagon-load of heads, you will be sure that it is the
part of the spoils that came to Downe's share, and going to be
hung up in the great hall at Cowick.(1055)

We have a vast deal of other good news; but as not one word of
it is true, I thought you would be content with this victory.
His Majesty is in high spirits, and is to make -,a triumphal
entry into Hanover on Tuesday fortnight.  I envy you the
illuminations and rejoicings that will be made at Worksop on
this occasion.

Four days ago we had a great victory over the Russians; but in
the hurry of this triumph it has somehow or other been mislaid,
and nobody can tell where to find it:--however, it is not given
over for lost.

Adieu, my dear lord! As I have been so circumstantial in the
account of this battle, I will not tire you with any thing
else.  My compliments to the lady of the menagerie.  I see your
new offices rise(1056) every day in a very respectable manner.

(1053) Afterwards Lord Dover,, then Minister at the Hague.

506 Letter 330
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(1057)
Arlington Street, Aug. 14, 1759.

I am here in the most unpleasant way in the world, attending
poor Mrs. Leneve's deathbed, a spectator of all the horrors of
tedious suffering and clear sense, and with no one soul to
speak to-but I will not tire you with a description of what has
quite worn me out.

Probably by this time you have seen the Duke of Richmond or
Fitzroy--but lest you should not, I will tell you all I can
learn, and a wonderful history it is.  Admiral Byng was not
more unpopular than Lord George Sackville.  I should scruple
repeating his story, if Betty(1058) and the waiters at Arthur's
did not talk of it publicly, and thrust Prince Ferdinand's
orders into one's hand.

You have heard, I suppose, of the violent animosities that have
reigned for the whole campaign between him and Lord Granby--in
which some other warm persons have been very warm too.  In the
heat of the battle, the Prince, finding thirty-six squadrons of
French coming down upon our army, sent Ligonier to order our
thirty-two squadrons, under Lord George to advance.  During
that transaction, the French appeared to waver; and Prince
Ferdinand, willing, as it is supposed, to give the honour to
the British horse of terminating the day, sent Fitzroy to bid
Lord George bring up only the British cavalry.  Ligonier had
but just delivered his message, when Fitzroy came with his.-
-Lord George said, "This can't be so--would he have me break
the line?  here is some mistake."  Fitzroy replied, he had not
argued upon the orders, but those were the orders. "Well!" said
Lord George, "but I want a guide."  Fitzroy said, he would be
his guide.  Lord George, "Where is the Prince?"  Fitzroy, "I
left him at the head of the left wing, I don't know where he is
now."  Lord George said he would go seek him, and have this
explained.  Smith then asked Fitzroy, to repeat the orders to
him; which being done, Smith went and whispered Lord George,
who says he then bid Smith carry up the cavalry: Smith is come,
and says he is ready to answer any body any question.  Lord
George says, Prince Ferdinand's behaviour to him has been most
infamous, has asked leave to resign his command, and to come
over, which is granted., Prince Ferdinand's behaviour is summed
up in the enclosed extraordinary paper; which you will doubt as
I did, but which is certainly genuine.  I doubted, because, in
the military, I thought direct disobedience of orders was
punished with an immediate -arrest, and because the last
paragraph seemed to me very foolish.  The going Out Of the way
to compliment Lord Granby with what he would have done, seems
to take off a little from the compliments paid to those that
have done something; but, in short, Prince Ferdinand or Lord
George, one of them, is most outrageously in the wrong, and the
latter has much the least chance of being thought in the right.

The particulars I tell you, I collect from the most accurate,
authorities.--I make no comments on Lord George, it would look
like a little dirty court to you; and the best compliment I can
make you, is to think, as I do, that you will be the last man
to enjoy this revenge.

You will be sorry for poor M'Kinsey and Lady Betty, who have
lost their only child at Turin.  Adieu!

(1059) Mr. Pitt in a letter of the 15th to Lord Bute, says,
"The king has given leave to Lord George Sackville to return to
England; his lordship having in a letter to Lord Holderness,
requested to be recalled from his command.  This mode of
returning, your lordship will perceive, is a very considerable
softening of his misfortune.  The current in all parts bears
hard upon him.  As I have already, so I shall continue to give
him, as a most unhappy man, all the offices of humanity which
our first, sacred duty, the public good, will allow." Chatham

507 Letter 331
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, August 29, 1759.

Truly I don't know whether one is to be rejoicing or lamenting!
Every good heart is a bonfire for Prince Ferdinand's success,
and a funeral pile for the King of Prussia's defeat.(1060)  Mr.
Yorke, who every week," "lays himself most humbly at the King's
feet" with some false piece of news, has almost ruined us in
illuminations for defeated victories--we were singing Te Deums
for the King of Prussia, when he was actually reduced to be
King of Custrin, for he has not only lost his neighbour's
capital, but his own too.  Mr. Bentley has long said, that we
should see him at Somerset House next winter; and really I
begin to be afraid that he will not live to write the history
of the war himself-I shall be content, if he is forced to do it
even by subscription.  Oh, that Daun! how he sits silent on his
drum, and shoves the King a little and a little farther out of
the world! The most provoking part of all is, (for I am mighty
soon comforted when a hero tumbles from the top of Fame's
steeple and breaks his neck,) that that tawdry toad,
Bruhl(1061) Will make a triumphant entry into the ruins of
Dresden, and rebuild all his palaces with what little money
remains in the country!

The mob, to comfort themselves under these mishaps, and for the
disappointment of a complete victory, that might have been more
compleater, are new grinding their teeth and nails, to tear
Lord George(1062) to pieces the instant he lands.  If he finds
more powerful friends than poor Admiral Byng, assure yourself
he has ten thousand times the number of personal enemies; I was
going to say real, but Mr. Byng's were real enough, with no
reason to be personal.  I don't talk of the event itself', for
I suppose all Europe knows just as much as we know here.  I
suspend my opinion till Lord George speaks himself--but I pity
his father, who has been so unhappy in his sons, who loved this
so much, and who had such fair prospects for him.  Lord
George's fall is prodigious; nobody stood higher, nobody has
more ambition or more sense.

You, I suppose, are taking leave of your new King of
Spain,(1064)--what a bloody war is saved by this death, by its
happening in the midst of one that cannot be more bloody!  I
detest a correspondence now; it lives like a vampire upon dead
bodies! Adieu! I have nothing to write about.

P. S. I forgot to ask you if you are not shocked with
Bellisle's letter to Contades? The French ought to behave with
more spirit than they do, before they give out such sanguinary
orders--@,iii(I if they did, I should think they would not give
such orders.  And did not YOU laugh at the enormous folly of
Bellisle's conclusion? It is so foolish, that I think he might
fairly disavow it.  It puts me in mind of a ridiculous passage
in Racine's Bajazet,
----"et s'il faut que je meure,
Mourons, moi, cher Osmin, comme un Visir; et toi
Comme le favori d'un homme tel que moi."

(1060) Prince Ferdinand's victory was the celebrated battle of

508 Letter 332
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Sept. 13, 1759.

With your unathletic constitution I think you will have a
greater weight of glory to represent than you can bear.  You
will be as `epuis`e as Princess Craon with all the triumphs
over Niagara, Ticonderoga, Crown Point, and such a parcel of
long names.  You will ruin yourself in French horns, to exceed
those of Marshal Botta, who has certainly found a pleasant way
of announcing victories. Besides, all the West Indies, which we
have taken by a panic, there is Admiral Boscawen has demolished
the Toulon squadron, and has made you Viceroy of the
Mediterranean.  I really believe the French will Come hither
now, for they can be safe nowhere else.  If the King of Prussia
should be totally undone in Germany, we can afford to give him
an appanage, as a younger son of England, of some hundred
thousand miles on the Ohio.  Sure universal monarchy was never
so put to shame as that of France! What a figure do they make!
they seem to have no ministers, no generals, no soldiers!  If
any thing could be more ridiculous than their behaviour in the
field, it would be in the cabinet!  Their invasion appears not
to have been designed against us, but against their own people,
who, they fear, will mutiny, and to quiet whom they disperse
expresses, with accounts of the progress of their arms in
England.  They actually have established posts to whom the
people are directed to send their letters for their friends in
England.  If, therefore, you hear that the French have
established themselves at Exeter or Norwich, don't be alarmed,
nor undeceive the poor women who are writing to their husbands
for English baubles.

We have lost another Princess, Lady Elizabeth.(1065)  She died
of an inflammation in her bowels in two days.  Her figure was
so very unfortunate, that it would have been difficult for her
to be happy, but her parts and application -were extraordinary.
I saw her act in "Cato" at eight years old, (when she could not
stand alone, but was forced to lean against the side-scene,)
better than any of her brothers and sisters.  She had been so
unhealthy, that at that age she had not been taught to read,
but had learned the part of Lucia by hearing the others study
their parts.  She went to her father and mother, and begged she
might act.  They put her off as gently as they could--she
desired leave to repeat her part, and when she did, it was with
so much sense, that there was no denying her.

I receive yours of August 25.  To all your alarms for the King
of Prussia I subscribe.  With little Brandenburgh he could not
exhaust all the forces of Bohemia, Hungary, Austria, Muscovy,
Siberia, Tartary,  Sweden, etc. etc. etc.--but not to
politicize too much, I believe the world will come to be fought
for somewhere between the North of Germany and the back of
Canada, between Count Daun and Sir William Johnson.(1066)

You guessed right about the King of Spain; he is dead, and the
Queen Dowager may once more have an opportunity of embroiling
the little of Europe that remains unembroiled.

Thank you, my dear Sir, for the Herculaneum and Caserta that
you are sending me. I wish the watch may arrive safe, to show
you that I am not insensible to all your attentions for me, but
endeavour, at a great distance, to imitate you in the execution
of commissions.

I would keep this letter back for a post, that I might have but
one trouble of sending you Quebec too; but when one has taken
so many places, it is not worth while to wait for one more.

Lord George Sackville, the hero of all conversation, if one can
be so for not being a hero, is arrived.  He immediately applied
for a court-martial, but was told it was impossible now, as the
officers necessary are in Germany.  This was in writing from
Lord Holderness--but Lord Ligonier in words was more squab--"If
he wanted a court-martial, he might go seek it in Germany." All
that could be taken from him is his regiment, above two
thousand pounds a-year: commander in Germany at ten pounds
a-day, between three and four thousand pounds:
lieutenant-general of the ordnance, one thousand five hundred
pounds: a fort, three hundred pounds.  He remains with a patent
place in Ireland, of one thousand two hundred pounds, and about
two thousand pounds a-year of his own and wife's.  With his
parts and ambition, it cannot end here; he calls himself
ruined, but when the Parliament meets, he will probably attempt
some sort of revenge.

They attribute, I don't know with what grounds, a sensible kind
of plan to the French; that De la Clue was to have pushed for
Ireland, Thurot for Scotland, and the Brest fleet for England--
but before they lay such great plans, they should take care of
proper persons to execute them.

I cannot help shifting at the great objects of our letters.  We
never converse on a less topic than a kingdom.  We are a kind
of citizens of the world, and battles and revolutions are the
common incidents of our neighbourhood.  But that is and must be
the case of distant correspondences: Kings and Empresses that
we never saw are the only persons we can be acquainted with in
common.  We can have no more familiarity than the Daily
Advertiser would have if it wrote to the Florentine Gazette.
Adieu! My compliments to any monarch that lives within five
hundred miles of you.

510 Letter 333
To The Earl Of Strafford.
Arlington Street, Sept. 13, 1759.

My dear lord,
You are very good to say you would accept of my letters, though
I should have no particular news to tell you; but at present it
would be treating heroes and conquerors with great
superciliousness, if I made use of your indulgence and said
nothing of them.  We have taken more places and ships in a week
than would have set up such pedant nations as Greece and Rome
to all futurity.  If we did but call Sir William Johnson
"Gulielmus Johnsonus Niagaricus," and Amherst "Galfridus
Amhersta Ticonderogicus," we should be quoted a thousand years
hence as the patterns of valour, virtue, and disinterestedness;
for posterity always ascribes all manner of modesty and
self-denial to those that take the most pains to perpetuate
their own glory.  Then Admiral Boscawen has, in a very Roman
style, made free with the coast of Portugal, and used it to
make a bonfire of the French fleet.  When Mr. Pitt was told of
this infraction of a neutral territory, he replied, "It is very
true, but they are burned."  In short, we want but a little
more insolence and a worse cause to make us a very classic
nation.

My Lady Townshend, who has not learning enough to copy a
Spartan mother, has lost her youngest son.(1067)  I saw her
this morning --her affectation is on t'other side she affects
grief--but not so much for the son she has lost, as for t'other
that she may lose.

Lord George is come, has asked for a court-martial, was put
off; and is turned out of every thing.  Waldegrave has his
regiment, for what he did; and Lord Granby the ordnance--for
what he would have done.

Lord Northampton is to be married(1068) to-night in full
Comptonhood.  I am indeed happy that Mr. Campbell(1069) is a
general; but how will his father like being the dowager-general
Campbell?

You are very kind, my lord (but that is not new,) in
interesting Yourself about Strawberry Hill.  I have just
finished a Holbein-chamber, that I flatter myself you will not
dislike; and I have begun to build a new printing-house, that
the old one may make room for the gallery and round tower.
This noble summer is not yet over us--it seems to have cut a
colt's week-.  I never write without talking of it, and should
be glad to know in how many letters this summer has been
mentioned.

I have lately been at Wilton, and was astonished at the heaps
of rubbish.  The house is grand, and the place glorious; but I
should shovel three parts of the marbles and pictures into the
river.  Adieu, my lord and lady!

511 Letter 334
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(1070)
Arlington Street, Sept. 13, 1759.

I intended to send you the brief chronicle of Lord George
Sackville but your brother says he has writ to you this
morning.  If you want to know minute particulars, which neither
he nor I should care to detail in a letter, I will tell you
them if you will call for a minute at Strawberry on Sunday or
Monday, as you go to your camp.  I ask this boldly, though I
have not been with you; but it was impossible; George Montagu
and his brother returned to Strawberry with me from the Vine,
and I am expecting Mr. Churchill and Lady Mary, who sent me
word they would come to me as soon as I came back, and I think
you will find them with me.

Lady Mary Coke is stripping off all the plumes that she has
been wearing for Niagara, etc., and is composing herself into
religious melancholy against to-morrow night, when she goes to
Princess Elizabeth's burial.  I passed this whole morning most
deliciously at my Lady Townshend's.  Poor Roger, for whom she
is not concerned, has given her a hint that her hero George may
be mortal too; she scarce spoke, unless to improve on some
bitter thing that Charles said, who was admirable.  He made me
all the speeches that Mr. Pitt will certainly make next winter,
in every one of which Charles says, and I believe, he will talk
of this great campaign, "memorable to all posterity with all
its imperfections-a campaign which, though obstructed, cramped,
maimed--but I will say no more."

The campaign in Ireland, I hear, will be very warm; the Primate
is again to be the object; Ponsonby, commander against him.
Lord George's situation will not help the Primate's.  Adieu!

512 Letter 335
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Saturday, October 11, 1759.

I don't desire any such conviction of your being ill as seeing
you nor can you wonder that I wish to persuade myself that what
I should be very sorry for, never happens.  Poor Fred.
Montagu's gout seems more serious: I am concerned that he has
so much of a judge in him already.

You are very good in thinking of me about the sofas; but you
know the Holbein chamber is complete, and old matters arc not
flung away upon you yourself Had not you rather have your sofa
than Lord Northampton's running footman? Two hundred years
hence one might be amused with reading of so fantastic a dress,
but they are horrid in one's own time.  Mr. Bentley and I go
to-morrow to Chaffont for two or three days.  Mr. Chute is at
the Vine already, but, I believe, will be in town this week.

I don't know whether it proceeds from the menaced invasion or
the last comet, but we are all dying of heat.  Every body has
put out their fires, and, if it lasts, I suppose will next week
make summer clothes.  The mornings are too hot for walking:
last night I heard of strawberries.  I impute it to the hot
weather that my head has been turned enough to contend with the
bards of the newspapers.  You have seen the French epigram on
Madame Pompadour, and fifty vile translations of it.  Here IS
Mine--

O yes! here are flat-bottom boats to be sold,
And soldiers to let-rather hungry than bold:
Here are ministers richly deserving to swing,
And commanders whose recompense should be a string.
O France! still your fate you may lay at Pitt's door;
You were saved by a Maid, and undone by a * * *

People again believe the invasion; and I don't wonder,
considering how great a militia we have, with such a boy as you
mention.  I own, before I begin to be afraid, I have a little
curiosity to see the militia tried.  I think one shall at least
laugh before one cries.  Adieu!  what time have you fixed for
looking southwards?

P. S. Your pictures you may have when you please; I think you
had better stay and take them with you, than risk the rubbing
them by the wagon.  Mr. M`untz has not been lately in town--
that is, Hannah has drawn no bill on him lately--so he knows
nothing of your snuff-box.  This it is to trust to my vivacity,
when it is past Its bloom.  Lord! I am a mere antiquarian, a
mere painstaking mortal.  Mr. Bentley says, that if all
antiquarians were like me, there would be no such thing as an
antiquarian, for I set down every thing, SO circumstantially
that I leave them nothing to find out.



513 Letter 336
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.(1071)
Strawberry Hill, October 14th, 1759.

If Strawberry Hill was not so barren of events as Chatham, I
would have writ to you again; nay, if it did not produce the
very same events.  Your own Light Horse are here, and commit
the only vivacities of the place--two or three of them are in
the cage every day for some mischief or other.  Indeed, they
seem to have been taken from school too soon, and, as Rigby
said of some others of these new troops, the moment their
exercise is over, they all go a bird's-nesting.  If the French
load their flat-bottom boats with rods instead of muskets, I
fear all our young heroes will run away.  The invasion seems
again come into fashion: I wish it would come, that one might
hear no more of it--nay, I wish it for two or three reasons.
If they don't come, we shall still be fatigued with the
militia, who will never go to plough again till they see an
enemy: if there is a peace before the militia runs away, one
shall be robbed every day by a constitutional force.  I want
the French too, to have come, that you may be released; but
that will not be soon enough for me, who am going to
Park-place.  I came from Chaffont to-day, and I cannot let the
winter appear without making my Lady Ailesbury a visit.
Hitherto my impediments may have looked like excuses, though
they were nothing less.  Lady Lyttelton goes on Wednesday: I
propose to follow her on Monday; but I won't announce myself,
that I may not be disappointed, and be a little more welcome by
the surprise; though I should be very ungrateful, if I affected
to think that I wanted that.

I cannot say I have read the second letter on Lord George: but
I have done what will satisfy the booksellers more; I have
bought nine or ten pamphlets: my library shall be au fait about
him, but I have an aversion to paper wars, and I must be a
little more interested than I am about him, before I can attend
to them: my head is to be filled with more sacred trash.

The Speaker was here t'other day, and told me of the intimacy
between his son and you and the militia.  He says the lawyers
are examining whether Lord George can be tried or not.  I am
sorry Lord Stormont is marriediski;(1072) he will pass his life
under the north pole, and whip over to Scotland by way of
Greenland without coming to London.

I dined t'other day at Sion with the Holdernesses; Lady Mary
Coke was there, and in this great dearth of candidates she
permits Haslang to die for her.  They were talking in the
bow-window, when a sudden alarm being given that dinner was on
the table, he expressed great joy and appetite.  You can't
imagine how she was offended.  Adieu!

514 Letter 337
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Oct. 16, 1759.

I love to prepare your countenance for every event that may
happen, for an ambassador, who is nothing but an actor, should
be that greatest of actors, a philosopher; and with the leave
of wise men (that is, hypocrites), philosophy I hold to be
little more than presence of mind now undoubtedly preparation
is a prodigious help to presence of mind.  In short, you must
not be surprised that we have failed at Quebec, as we certainly
shall.  You may say, if you please, in the style of modern
politics that your court never supposed it could be taken; the
attempt was only made to draw off the Russians from the King of
Prussia, and leave him at liberty to attack Daun.  Two days ago
came letters from Wolfe, despairing, as much as heroes can
despair The town is well victualled, Amherst is not arrived,
and fifteen thousand men encamped defend it.  We have lost many
men by the enemy, and some by our friends-that is, we now call
our nine thousand only seven thousand.  How this little army
will get away from a much larger, and in this season in that
country, I don't guess--yes, I do.

You may be making up a little philosophy too against the
invasion, which is again come into fashion, and with a few
trifling incidents in its favour, such as our fleet dispersed
and driven from their coasts by a great storm.  Before that,
they were actually embarking, but with so ill a grace that an
entire regiment mutinied, and they say is broke.  We now expect
them in Ireland, unless this dispersion of our fleet tempts
them hither.  If they do not come in a day or two, I shall give
them over.

You will see in our gazettes that we make a great figure in the
East Indies.  In short, Mr. Pitt and this little island appear
of some consequence even in the map of the world.  He is a new
sort of Fabius,

----Qui verbis restituit rem.

Have you yet received the -watch? I see your poor Neapolitan
Prince(1073) is at last set aside--I should honour Dr. Serrao's
integrity, if I did not think it was more humane to subscribe
to the poor boy's folly, than hazard his being poisoned by
making it doubtful.

My charming niece is breeding--you see I did not make my lord
Waldegrave an useless present.  Adieu! my dear Sir.

514 Letter 338
To The Hon. H. S. Conway.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 18, 1759.

I intended my visit to Park-place to show my lady Ailesbury
that when I come hither it is not solely on your account, and
yet I will not quarrel with my journey thither if I should find
you there; but seriously I cannot help begging you to think
whether you will go thither or not, just now.  My first thought
about you has ever been what was proper for you to do; and
though you are the man in the world that think of that the most
yourself, yet you know I have twenty scruples, which even you
sometimes laugh at.  I will tell them to You, and then you will
judge, as you can best.  Sir Edward Hawke and his fleet is
dispersed, at least driven back to Plymouth: the French, if one
may believe that they have broken a regiment for mutinying
against embarking, were actually embarked at that instant.  The
most sensible people I know, always thought they would postpone
their invasion, if ever they intended it, till our great ships
could not keep the sea, or were eaten up by the scurvy.  Their
ports are now free; their situation is desperate: the new
account of our taking Quebec leaves them in the most deplorable
condition; they will be less able than ever to raise money, we
have got ours for next year;                     and this event
would facilitate it, if we had not: they must try for a
          peace, they have nothing to go to market with but
Minorca.  In short, if they cannot strike some desperate blow
in this island or Ireland, they are undone: the loss of twenty
thousand men to do us                     some mischief, would
be cheap.  I should even think Madame Pompadour in danger of
being torn to pieces, if they did not make some attempt.
Madame Maintenon, not half so unpopular, mentions in one of her
letters her unwillingness to trust her niece Mademoiselle
            Aumale on the road, for fear of some such
accident.  You will smile perhaps at all this reasoning and
pedantry; but it tends to this--if desperation should send the
French somewhere, and the wind should force them to your coast,
which I do not suppose their object, and you should be out of
the way, you know what your enemies would say; and strange as
it is, even you have been proved to have enemies.
    My dear Sir, think of this! Wolfe, as I am convinced, has
fallen a                     sacrifice to his rash blame of
you.             If I understand any thing in the
    world, his letter that came on Sunday said this: "Qu`ebec
is impregnable; it is flinging away the lives of brave men to
attempt it.                I am in the situation of Conway at
Rochefort; but having blamed him, I must do what I now see he
was in the right to see was wrong and yet what he would have
done; and as I am commander-, which he was not, I have the
melancholy power of doing what he was prevented doing."(1074)
Poor man! his life has paid the price of his injustice; and as
his death has purchased such benefit to his country, I lament
him, as I am sure you, who have twenty times more courage and
good-nature than I have, do too.  In short, I, who never did
any thing right or prudent myself, (not, I am afraid, for want
of knowing what was so,) am content with your being perfect,
and with suggesting any thing to you that may tend to keep you
so;--and (what is not much to the present purpose) if such a
pen as mine can effect it, the world hereafter shall know that
you was so.  In short, I have pulled down my Lord Falkland, and
desire you will take care that I may speak the truth when I
erect you in his place; for remember, I love truth even better
than I love you.  I always confess my own faults, and I will
not palliate yours.  But, laughing apart, if you think there is
no weight in what I say, I shall gladly meet you at Park-place,
whither I shall go on Monday, and stay as long as I can, unless
I hear from you to the contrary.  If you should think I have
hinted any thing to you of consequence, would not it be
handsome, if, after receiving leave you should write to my Lord
Llegonier, that though you had been at home but one week in the
whole summer, yet there might be occasion for your presence in
the camp, you should decline the permission he had given you?-
-See what it is to have a wise relation, who preaches a
thousand fine things to you which he would be the last man in
the world to practise himself.  Adieu!

(1074) General Wolfe's letter, written four days before his
death, which will be found in the Chatham Correspondence, does
not contain a single sentence which can be tortured into the
construction here given to it. "The extreme heat of the weather
in August," he says, "and a good deal of fatigue, threw me into
a fever; but that the business might go on, I begged the
generals to consider amongst themselves what was fittest to be
done.  Their sentiments were unanimous, that (as the easterly
winds begin to blow, and ships can pass the town in the night
with provisions, Artillery, etc.) we "should endeavour, by
conveying a considerable corps into the upper river, to draw
them from their inaccessible situation and bring them to an
action.  I agreed to the proposal; and we are now here, with
about three thousand six Hundred men, waiting an opportunity to
attack them, when and wherever they can best be got at.  The
weather has been extremely unfavourable for a day or two, so
that we have been inactive.  I am so far recovered as to do
business; but my constitution is entirely ruined, without the
consolation of having done any considerable service to the
state, or without any prospect of it."  Walpole, however, in
his animated description of the capture of Quebec, in his
Memoires, does ample justice to the character of Wolfe. "His
fall," he says, "was noble indeed.  He received a wound in the
head, but covered it from his soldiers with his handkerchief.
A second ball struck him in the belly: that too he dissembled.
A third hitting him on the breast, he sunk under the anguish,
and was carried behind the ranks.  Yet, fast as life ebbed out,
his whole anxiety centred on the fortune of the day. He begged
to be borne nearer to the action; but his sight being dimmed by
the approach of death, he entreated to know what they who
supported him saw; he was answered, that the enemy gave ground;
he eagerly repeated the question; heard the enemy was totally
routed; cried, 'I am satisfied!' and expired."-E.



516 Letter 339
To Sir Horace Mann.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 19, 1759.

I had no occasion to be in such a hurry to prepare your
ambassadorial countenance; if I had stayed but one day more, I
might have left its muscles to behave as they pleased.  The
notification of a probable disappointment at Quebec came only
to heighten the pleasure of the conquest.  You may now give
yourself what airs you please, you are master of East and West
Indies.  An ambassador is the only man in the world whom
bullying becomes: I beg your pardon, but you are spies, if you
are not bragadochios.  All precedents are on your side:
Persians, Greeks, Romans, always insulted their neighbours when
they conquered Quebec.  Think how pert the French would have
been on such an occasion, and remember that they are Austrians
to whom you are to be saucy.  You see, I write as if my name
was Belleisle and yours Contades.

It was a very singular affair, the generals on both sides
slain, and on both sides the second in command wounded; in
short, very near what battles should be, in which only the
principals ought to suffer.  If their army has not ammunition
and spirit enough to fall again upon ours before Amherst comes
up, all North America is ours!

Poetic justice could not have been executed with more rigour
than it has been on the perjury, treachery, and usurpations of
the French.  I hope Mr.-Pitt will not leave them at the next
treaty an opportunity of committing so many national crimes
again.  How they or we can make a peace, I don't see; can we
give all back, or they give all up?  No, they must come hither;
they have nothing left for @it but to conquer us.

Don't think it is from forgetting to tell you particulars, that
I tell you none; I am here, and don't know one but what you
will see in the Gazette, and by which it appears that the
victory was owing to the impracticability, as the French
thought, and to desperate resolution on our side.  What a
scene! an army in the night dragging itself up a precipice by
stumps of trees to assault a town and attack an army strongly
entrenched and double in numbers!

Adieu ! I think I shall not write to you again this
twelvemonth; for, like Alexander, we have no more worlds left
to conquer.

P. S. Monsieur Thurot is said to be sailed with his tiny
squadron --but can the lords of America be afraid of half a
dozen canoes ?  Mr. Chute is sitting by me, and says, nobody is
more obliged to Mr. Pitt than you are: he has raised you from a
very comfortable situation to hold your head above the Capitol.



517 Letter 340
To George Montagu, Esq.
Strawberry Hill, Oct. 21, 1759.

Your pictures shall be sent as soon as any of us go to London,
but I think that will not be till the Parliament meets.  Can we
easily leave the remains of such a year as this? It is still
all gold.  I have not dined or gone to bed by a fire till the
day before yesterday.  Instead of the glorious and
ever-memorable year 1759, as the newspapers call it, I call it
this ever-warm and victorious year.  We have not had more
conquest than fine weather: one would think we had plundered
East and West Indies of sunshine.  Our bells are worn
threadbare with ringing for victories.  I believe it will
require ten votes of the House of Commons before the people
will believe it is the Duke of Newcastle that has done this,
and not Mr. Pitt.  One thing is very fatiguing--all the world
is made knights or generals.  Adieu I don't know a word of news
less than the conquest of America.  Adieu! yours ever.

P ' S. You shall hear from me again if we take Mexico or China
before Christmas.

P. S. I had sealed my letter, but break it open again,
having forgot to tell you that Mr. Cowslade has the pictures of
Lord and Lady Cutts, and is willing to sell them.



518 Letter 341
To The Earl Of Strafford.
Strawberry Hill, October 30th, 1759.

My dear lord,
It would be very extraordinary indeed if I was not glad to see
one Whose friendship does me so much honour as your lordship's,
and who always expresses so much kindness to me.  I have an
additional reason for thanking you now, when you are creating a
building after the design of the Strawberry committee.  It will
look, I fear, very selfish if I pay it a visit next year; and
yet it answers so many selfish purposes that I certainly shall.

My ignorance of all the circumstances relating to Quebec is
prodigious; I have contented myself with the rays of' glory
that reached hither, without going to London to bask in them.
I have not even seen the conqueror's mother(1075) though I hear
she has covered herself with more laurel-leaves than were
heaped on the children of the wood.

Seriously it is very great; and as I am too inconsiderable to
envy Mr. Pitt, I give him all the honour he deserves.

I passed all the last week at Park-place, where one of the
bravest men in the world, who is not permitted to contribute to
our conquests, was indulged in being the happiest by being with
one of the most deserving women--for Campbell-goodness no more
wears out than Campbell-beauty--all their good qualities are
huckaback.(1076)  YOU See the Duchess(1077) has imbibed so much
of' their durableness, that she is good-humoured enough to dine
at a tavern at seventy-six.

Sir William Stanhope wrote to Mrs. Ellis,(1078) that he had
pleased himself, having seen much of Mr. Nugent and Lady
Berkeley this summer, and having been so charmed with the
felicity of their menage, that he could not resist marrying
again.  His daughter replied, that it had always been her
opinion, that people should please themselves, and that she was
glad he had; but as to taking the precedent of Lady Berkeley,
she hoped it would answer in nothing but in my Lady Stanhope
having three children the first year.  You see, my lord, Mrs.
Ellis has bottled up her words(1079) till they sparkle at last!

I long to have your approbation of my Holbein-chamber; it has a
comely sobriety that I think answers very well to the tone it
should have.  My new printing-house is finished, in order to
pull down the old one, and lay the foundations next summer of
my round tower.  Then follows the gallery and chapel-cabinet.
I hear your lordship has tapped your magnificent front too.
Well, when all your magnificences and minimificences are
finished, then, we--won't sit down and drink, as Pyrrhus
said,--no, I trust we shall never conclude our plans so
filthily: then--I fear we shall begin others.  Indeed, I don't
know what the Countess may do: if she imitates her mother, she
will go to a tavern at fourscore, and then she and Pyrrhus may
take a bottle together---I hope she will live to try at least
whether she likes it. -Adieu, both!

(1075) Lady Townshend.  On the death of General Wolfe, Colonel
Townshend received the surrender.

(1076) Lady Ailesbury and Lady Strafford, both preserved their
beauty so long, that Mr. Walpole called them huck(iback
beauties, that never wear out.

(1077) The Duchess of Argyle, widow of John Campbell, Duke of
Argyle, and mother to Lady Strafford.

(1078) His daughter.

(1079) She was very silent.



519 Letter 342
To The Right Hon. Lady Hervey.
Saturday, Nov. 3d, 1759.

Poor Robins' Almanack. Thick fogs, and some wet.  Go not out of
town.  Gouts and rheumatisms are abroad.  Warm clothes, good
fires, and a room full of pictures, glasses, and scarlet damask
are the best physic.

In short, for fear your ladyship should think of Strawberry on
Saturday, I can't help telling you that I am to breakfast at
Petersham that day with Mr. Fox and Lady Caroline, Lord and
Lady Waldegrave.  How did you like the farce? George Selwyn
says he wants to see High Life below Stairs (1080) as he is
weary of low life above stairs.

(1080) This popular' farce was written by the Rev.  James
Townley, high master of Merchant Tailors' School . Dr, Johnson
said of it, "Here is a farce which is really very diverting
when you see it acted, and yet one may read it and not know
that one has been reading any thing at all;" and of the actors,
Goldsmith tells us, that "Mr. Palmer and Mr. King were entirely
what they desired to represent; and Mrs. Clive (but what need I
talk of her, since without exaggeration she has more true
humour than any actor or actress, upon the English or any other
stage, I have seen), she, I say, did the part all the justice
it was capable of."  In England it was very successful; but in
Edinburgh the gentlemen of the party-coloured livery raised
violent riots in the theatre whenever it was performed.-E.



519 Letter 343
To George Montagu, Esq.
Arlington Street, Nov. 8, 1759.

Your pictures will set out on Saturday; I give you notice that
you may inquire for them.  I did not intend to be here these
three days, but my Lord Bath taking the trouble to send a man
and horse to ask me to dinner yesterday, I did not know how to
refuse; and, besides, as Mr. Bentley said to me, "you know he
was an old friend of your father."

The town is empty, but is coming to dress itself for Saturday.
My Lady Coventry showed George Selwyn her clothes; they are
blue, with spots of silver, of the size of a shilling, and a
silver trimming, and cost--my lord will know what.  She asked
George how he liked them; he replied, "Why, you will be change
for a guinea."

I find nothing talked of but the French bankruptcy;(1081) Sir
Robert Brown, I hear--and am glad to hear--will be a great
sufferer.  They put gravely into the article of bankrupts in
the newspapers, "Louis le Petit, of the city of Paris,
peace-breaker, dealer, and chapman;"  it would have been still
better if they had said, "Louis Bourbon of petty France." We
don't know what is become of their Monsieur Thurot,(1082) of
whom we had still a little mind to be afraid.  I should think
he would do like Sir Thomas Hanmer, make a faint effort, beg
pardon of the Scotch for their disappointment, and retire.
Here are some pretty verses just arrived.

Pourquoi le baton `a Soubise,
Puisque Chevert est le vainqueur?
C'est de la cour une m`eprise,
Ou bien le but de la faveur.

Je ne vois rien l`a qui m'`etonne,
Repond aussitot un railleur;
C'est `a l'aveugle qu'on le donne,
Et non pas au COnducteur.

Lady Meadows has left nine thousand pounds in reversion after
her husband to Lord Sandwich's daughter.  Apropos to my Lady
Meadow's maiden name,(1083) a name I believe you have sometimes
heard: I was diverted t'other day with a story of a lady of
that name,(1084) and a lord, whose initial is no farther from
hers than he himself is sometimes supposed to be.  Her
postillion, a lad of sixteen, said, "I am not such a child but
I can guess something: whenever my Lord Lyttelton comes to my
lady, she orders the porter to let in nobody else, and then
they call for a pen and ink, and say they are going to Write
history." Is not this finesse so like him? 'Do you know that I
am persuaded, now he is parted, that he will forget- he is
married, and propose himself in form to some woman or other.

When do you come? if it is not soon, you will find a new town.
I stared to-day at Piccadilly like a country squire; there are
twenty new stone houses; at first I concluded that all the
grooms, that used to live there, had got estates to build
palaces.  One young gentleman, who was getting an estate, but
was so indiscreet as to step out of his way to rob a comrade,
is convicted, and to be transported; in short, one of the
waiters at Arthur's.  George Selwyn says, "What a horrid idea
he will give of us to the people
in Newgate!"

I was still more surprised t'other day, than at seeing
Piccadilly, by receiving a letter from the north of Ireland
from a clergyman, with violent encomiums on my Catalogue of
Noble Authors--and this when I thought it quite forgot.  It put
me in mind of the queen that sunk at Charing-cross and rose at
Queenhithe.

Mr. Chute has got his commission to inquire about your Cutts,
but he thinks the lady is not your grandmother.  You are very
ungenerous to hoard tales from me of your ancestry: what
relation have I spared?  If your grandfathers were knaves, will
your bottling up their bad blood amend it?  Do you only take a
cup of it now and then by yourself, and then come down to your
parson, and boast of it, as if it was pure old metheglin?  I
sat last night with the Mater Gracchorum--oh! 'tis a mater
Jagorum; if her descendants taste any of her black blood, they
surely will make as wry faces at it as the servant in Don John
does when the ghost decants a corpse.  Good night!  I am just
returning to Strawberry, to husband my two last days and to
avoid all the pomp of the birthday.  Oh! I had forgot, there is
a Miss Wynne coming forth, that is to be handsomer than my Lady
Coventry; but I have known one threatened with such every
summer for these seven years, and they are always addled by
winter!

521 Letter 344
To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Nov. 16, 1759.

Now the Parliament is met, you will expect some new news; you
will be disappointed: no battles are fought in Parliament now--
the House of Commons is a mere war-office, and only sits for
the despatch of military business.  As I am one of the few men
in England who am neither in the army nor militia, I never go
thither.  By the King's speech, and Mr. Pitt's t'other speech,
it looks as if we intended to finish the conquest of the world
the next campaign.  The King did not go to the House; his last
eye is so bad that he could scarce read his answer to the
address, though the letters were as long and as black as Ned
Finch.  He complains that every body's face seems to have a
crape over it.  A person much more expected and much more
missed, was not at the House neither; Lord George Sackville.
He came to town the night before the opening, but did not
appear--it looks as if he gave every thing up.  Did you hear
that M. de Contades saluted Prince Ferdinand on his
installation with twenty-one cannons?  The French could
distinguish the outside of the ceremony, and the Prince sent
word to the marshal, that if he observed any bustle that day,
he must not expect to be attacked-it would only be a chapter of
the Garter.

A very extraordinary event happened the day after the meeting:
Lord Temple resigned the privy-seal.  The account he gives
himself is, that he continued to be so ill used by the King,
that it was notorious to all the world; that in hopes of taking
off that reproach, he had asked for the Garter.(1085)  Being
refused, he had determined to resign, at the same time
beseeching Mr. Pitt not to resent any thing for him, and
insisting with his two brothers that they should keep their
places, and act as warm as ever with the administration, That
in an audience of twenty-five minutes he hoped he had removed
his Majesty's prejudices, and should now go out of town as well
satisfied as any man in England.  The town says, that it was
concerted that he should not quit till Mr. Pitt made his speech
on the first day, declaring that nothing should make him break
union with the rest of the ministers, no, not for the nearest
friend he had.  All this is mighty fine; but the affair is,
nevertheless, very impertinent.  If Lord Temple hoped to
involve Mr. Pitt in his quarrel, it was very wicked at such a
crisis as this--and if he could, I am apt to believe he would--
if he could not, it was very silly.  To the garter nobody can
have slenderer pretensions; his family is scarce older than his
earldom, which is of the youngest.  His person is ridiculously,
awkward; and if chivalry were in vogue, he has given proofs of
having no passion for tilt and tournament.  Here end@ the
history of King George the Second, and Earl Temple the First.

We are still advised to believe in the invasion, though it
seems as slow in coming as the millennium.  M. Thurot and his
pigmy navy have scrambled to Gottenburg, where it is thought
they will freight themselves with half a dozen pounds of
Swedes.  We continue to militiate, and to raise light troops,
and when we have armed every apprentice in England, I suppose
we shall translate our fears to Germany.  In the mean time the
King is overwhelmed with addresses on our victories he will
have enough to paper his palace.  ITe told the City of London,
that all was owing to unanimity, but I think he should have
said, to unmanimity, for it were shameful to ascribe our
brilliancy to any thing but Mr. Pitt.  The new King of Spain
seems to think that our fleet is the best judge of the
incapacity of his eldest son, and of the fitness of his
disposition of Naples, for he has expressed the highest
confidence of Wall, and the strongest assurances of neutrality.
I am a little sorry that Richcourt is not in Florence; it would
be pleasant to dress yourself up in mural crowns and American
plumes in his face.  Adieu!

(1085) By the following passage of a letter from Lord Temple
himself to Mr. Pitt, of the 13th of October, in the Chatham
Correspondence, it will be seen that it was not his lordship
who solicited the garter, but Mr. Pitt:--"You have been so good
as to ask of his Majesty the garter for me, as a reward to
yourself, and the only one you desire for all the great and
eminent services you have done to, the King, to the nation, and
to the electorate; to which request you have, it seems,
hitherto met with a refusal.  At the same time that I thank
you, and am proud to receive any testimony of your kind regard,
permit me to add, that I am not so mean-spirited as to
condescend to receive, in my own person, the reward of another
man's services, however dear to me you so deservedly are on
every account.  Let the King continue to enjoy in peace the
pleasure and Honour of this refusal; for if he should happen to
be disposed, for other reasons than those of gratitude to you,
which will have no weight with him, to give me that mark of
distinction, I will not accept it on such terms." Vol. i. p.

projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

We need your donations more than ever!

As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,

We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

The most recent list of states, along with all methods for donations
(including credit card donations and international donations), may be
found online at http://www.gutenberg.net/donation.html

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655-4109

Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment
method other than by check or money order.


The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.

We need your donations more than ever!

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the

     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          eBook in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?
