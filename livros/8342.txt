THE PROPHECY OF AGGEUS

AGGEUS was one of those that returned from the captivity of Babylon, in
the first year of the reign of king Cyrus. He was sent by the Lord, in
the second year of the reign of king Darius, the son of Hystaspes, to
exhort Zorobabel the prince of Juda, and Jesus the high priest, to the
building of the temple; which they had begun, but left off again through
the opposition of the Samaritans. In consequence of this exhortation
they proceeded in the building and finished the temple. And the prophet
was commissioned by the Lord to assure them that this second temple
should be more glorious than the former, because the Messiah should
honour it with his presence: signifying withal how much the church of
the New Testament should excel that of the Old Testament.


Aggeus Chapter 1

The people are reproved for neglecting to build the temple. They are
encouraged to set about the work.

1:1. In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the
first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus
the prophet, to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, governor of Juda, and to
Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, saying:

1:2. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, saying: This people saith: The time
is not yet come for building the house of the Lord.

1:3. And the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus the prophet,
saying:

1:4. Is it time for you to dwell in ceiled houses, and this house lie
desolate?

1:5. And now thus saith the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts to consider
your ways.

1:6. You have sowed much, and brought in little: you have eaten, but
have not had enough: you have drunk, but have not been filled with
drink: you have clothed yourselves, but have not been warmed: and he
that hath earned wages, put them into a bag with holes.

1:7. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts upon your ways:

1:8. Go up to the mountain, bring timber, and build the house: and it
shall be acceptable to me, and I shall be glorified, saith the Lord.

1:9. You have looked for more, and behold it became less, and you
brought it home, and I blowed it away: why, saith the Lord of hosts?
because my house is desolate, and you make haste every man to his own
house.

1:10. Therefore the heavens over you were stayed from giving dew, and
the earth was hindered from yielding her fruits:

1:11. And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains,
and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon all
that the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon beasts, and upon
all the labour of the hands.

1:12. Then Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec
the high priest, and all the remnant of the people hearkened to the
voice of the Lord their God, and to the words of Aggeus the prophet, as
the Lord their God sent him to them: and the people feared before the
Lord.

1:13. And Aggeus the messenger of the Lord, as one of the messengers of
the Lord, spoke, saying to the people: I am with you, saith the Lord.

1:14. And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zorobabel the son of
Salathiel governor of Juda, and the spirit of Jesus the son of Josedec
the high priest, and the spirit of all the rest of the people: and they
went in, and did the work in the house of the Lord of Hosts their God.

Aggeus Chapter 2

Christ by his coming shall make the latter temple more glorious than the
former. The blessing of God shall reward their labour in building. God's
promise to Zorobabel.

2:1. In the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth month, in
the second year of Darius the king, they began.

2:2. And in the seventh month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of
Aggeus the prophet, saying:

2:3. Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel the governor of Juda, and
to Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and to the rest of the
people, saying:

2:4. Who is left among you, that saw this house in its first glory? and
how do you see it now? is it not in comparison to that as nothing in
your eyes?

2:5. Yet now take courage, O Zorobabel, saith the Lord, and take
courage, Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and take courage, all
ye people of the land, saith the Lord of hosts: and perform (for I am
with you, saith the Lord of hosts)

2:6. The word that I convenanted with you when you came out of the land
of Egypt: and my spirit shall be in the midst of you: fear not.

2:7. For thus saith the Lord of hosts: Yet one little while, and I will
move the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.

2:8. And I will move all nations: AND THE DESIRED OF ALL NATIONS SHALL
COME: and I will fill this house with glory: saith the Lord of hosts.

2:9. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts.

2:10. Great shall be the glory of this last house more than of the
first, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place I will give peace,
saith the Lord of hosts.

2:11. In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second
year of Darius the king, the word of the Lord came to Aggeus the
prophet, saying:

2:12. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Ask the priests the law, saying:

2:13. If a man carry sanctified flesh in the skirt of his garment, and
touch with his skirt, bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat:
shall it be sanctified? And the priests answered, and said: No.

2:14. And Aggeus said: If one that is unclean by occasion of a soul
touch any of all these things, shall it be defiled? And the priests
answered, and said: It shall be defiled.

By occasion of a soul... That is, by having touched the dead; in which
case, according to the prescription of the law, Num. 19.13, 22, a person
not only became unclean himself, but made every thing that he touched
unclean. The prophet applies all this to the people, whose souls
remained unclean by neglecting the temple of God; and therefore were not
sanctified by the flesh they offered in sacrifice: but rather defiled
their sacrifices by approaching to them in the state of uncleanness.

2:15. And Aggeus answered, and said: So is this people, and so is this
nation before my face, saith the Lord, and so is all the work of their
hands: and all that they have offered there, shall be defiled.

2:16. And now consider in your hearts, from this day and upward, before
there was a stone laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord.

2:17. When you went to a heap of twenty bushels, and they became ten:
and you went into the press, to press out fifty vessels, and they became
twenty.

2:18. I struck you with a blasting wind, and all the works of your hand
with the mildew and with hail, yet there was none among you that
returned to me, saith the Lord.

2:19. Set your hearts from this day, and henceforward, from the four and
twentieth day of the ninth month: from the day that the foundations of
the temple of the Lord were laid, and lay it up in your hearts.

2:20. Is the seed as yet sprung up? or hath the vine, and the fig tree,
and the pomegranate, and the olive tree as yet flourished? from this day
I will bless you.

2:21. And the word of the Lord came a second time to Aggeus in the four
and twentieth day of the month, saying:

2:22. Speak to Zorobabel the governor of Juda, saying: I will move both
heaven and earth.

2:23. And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and will destroy the
strength of the kingdom of the Gentiles: and I will overthrow the
chariot, and him that rideth therin: and the horses and their riders
shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.

2:24. In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, I will take thee, O
Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, my servant, saith the Lord, and will
make thee as a signet, for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord of hosts.

O Zorobabel... This promise principally relates to Christ, who was of
the race of Zorobabel.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
