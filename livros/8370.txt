THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE

The Apostle commends Electa and her family for their steadfastness in
the true faith and exhorts them to persevere, lest they lose the reward
of their labours. He exhorts them to love one another. But with heretics
to have no society, even not to salute them. Although this Epistle is
written to a particular person, yet its instructions may serve as a
lesson to others, especially to those who, from their connections,
situation, or condition in life, are in danger of perversion.


2 John Chapter 1

He recommends walking in truth, loving one another and to beware of
false teachers.

1:1. The Ancient to the lady Elect and her children, whom I love in the
truth: and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth,

The ancient... That is, the ancient bishop St. John, being the only one
of the twelve apostles then living. To the lady Elect...  Some
conjecture that Electa might be the name of a family, or of a particular
church; but the general opinion is, that it is the proper name of a
lady, so eminent for her piety and great charity, as to merit this
Epistle from St. John.

1:2. For the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us and shall be with us
for ever.

1:3. Grace be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father and from
Christ Jesus the Son of the Father: in truth and charity.

1:4. I was exceeding glad that I found of thy children walking in truth,
as we have received a commandment from the Father.

1:5. And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing a new commandment to
thee, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one
another.

1:6. And this is charity: That we walk according to his commandments.
For this is the commandment that, as you have heard from the beginning,
you should walk in the same:

1:7. For many seducers are gone out into the world who confess not that
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a seducer and an antichrist.

1:8. Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have
wrought: but that you may receive a full reward.

1:9. Whosoever revolteth and continueth not in the doctrine of Christ
hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine, the same hath both the
Father and the Son.

1:10. If any man come to you and bring not this doctrine, receive him
not into the house nor say to him: God speed you.

Nor say to him, God speed you... This admonition is in general, to
forewarn the faithful of the dangers which may arise from a familiarity
with those who have prevaricated and gone from the true faith, and with
such as teach false doctrine. But this is not forbidding a charity for
all men, by which we ought to wish and pray for the eternal salvation of
every one, even of our enemies.

1:11. For he that saith unto him: God speed you, communicateth with his
wicked works.

1:12. Having more things to write unto you, I would not by paper and
ink: for I hope that I shall be with you and speak face to face, that
your joy may be full.

1:13. The children of thy sister Elect salute thee.

Produced by David Widger

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
