THE PROPHECY OF MALACHIAS

MALACHIAS, whose name signifies The Angel of the Lord, was contemporary
with NEHEMIAS, and by some is believed to have been the same person as
ESDRAS. He was the last of the prophets, in the order of time, and
flourished about four hundred years before Christ. He foretells the
coming of Christ; the reprobation of the Jews and their sacrifices; and
the calling of the Gentiles, who shall offer up to God in every place an
acceptable sacrifice.


Malachias Chapter 1

God reproaches the Jews with their ingratitude: and the priests for not
offering pure sacrifices. He will accept of the sacrifice that shall be
offered in every place among the Gentiles.

1:1. The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by the hand of
Malachias.

1:2. I have loved you, saith the Lord: and you have said: Wherein hast
thou loved us? Was not Esau brother to Jacob, saith the Lord, and I have
loved Jacob,

I have loved Jacob, etc... I have preferred his posterity, to make them
my chosen people, and to lead them with my blessings, without any merit
on their part, and though they have been always ungrateful; whilst I
have rejected Esau, and executed severe judgments upon his posterity.
Not that God punished Esau, or his posterity, beyond their desert: but
that by his free election and grace he loved Jacob, and favoured his
posterity above their deserts. See the annotations upon Rom. 9.

1:3. But have hated Esau? and I have made his mountains a wilderness,
and given his inheritance to the dragons of the desert.

1:4. But if Edom shall say: We are destroyed, but we will return and
build up what hath been destroyed: thus saith the Lord of hosts: They
shall build up, and I will throw down: and they shall be called the
borders of wickedness, and the people with whom the Lord is angry for
ever.

1:5. And your eyes shall see: and you shall say: The Lord be magnified
upon the border of Israel.

1:6. The son honoureth the father, and the servant his master: if then I
be a father, where is my honour?  and if I be a master, where is my
fear: saith the Lord of hosts.

1:7. To you, O priests, that despise my name, and have said: Wherein
have we despised thy name? You offer polluted bread upon my altar, and
you say: Wherein have we polluted thee? In that you say: The table of
the Lord is contemptible.

1:8. If you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you
offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil? offer it to thy prince, if
he will be pleased with it, or if he will regard thy face, saith the
Lord of hosts.

1:9. And now beseech ye the face of God, that he may have mercy on you,
(for by your hand hath this been done,) if by any means he will receive
your faces, saith the Lord of hosts.

1:10. Who is there among you, that will shut the doors, and will kindle
the fire on my altar gratis? I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord
of hosts: and I will not receive a gift of your hand.

1:11. For from the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is
great among the Gentiles, and in every place there is sacrifice, and
there is offered to my name a clean oblation: for my name is great among
the Gentiles, saith the Lord of hosts.

A clean oblation... Viz., the precious body and blood of Christ in the
eucharistic sacrifice.

1:12. And you have profaned it in that you say: The table of the Lord is
defiled: and that which is laid thereupon is contemptible with the fire
that devoureth it.

1:13. And you have said: Behold of our labour, and you puffed it away,
saith the Lord of hosts, and you brought in of rapine the lame, and the
sick, and brought in an offering: shall I accept it at your hands, saith
the Lord?

Behold of our labour, etc... You pretended labour and weariness, when
you brought your offering; and so made it of no value, by offering it
with an evil mind. Moreover, what you offered was both defective in
itself, and gotten by rapine and extortion.

1:14. Cursed is the deceitful man that hath in his flock a male, and
making a vow offereth in sacrifice that which is feeble to the Lord: for
I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful
among the Gentiles.

Malachias Chapter 2

The priests are sharply reproved for neglecting their covenant. The evil
of marrying with idolaters: and too easily putting away their wives.

2:1. And now, O ye priests, this commandment is to you.

2:2. If you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give
glory to my name, saith the Lord of hosts: I will send poverty upon you,
and will curse your blessings, yea I will curse them, because you have
not laid it to heart.

2:3. Behold, I will cast the shoulder to you, and will scatter upon your
face the dung of your solemnities, and it shall take you away with it.

I will cast the shoulder to you... I will cast away the shoulder, which
in the law was appointed to be your portion, and fling it at you in my
anger: and will reject both you and your festivals like dung.

2:4. And you shall know that I sent you this commandment, that my
covenant might be with Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.

2:5. My covenant was with him of life and peace: and I gave him fear:
and he feared me, and he was afraid before my name.

2:6. The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in
his lips: he walked with me in peace, and in equity, and turned many
away from iniquity.

2:7. For the lips of the priests shall keep knowledge, and they shall
seek the law at his mouth: because he is the angel of the Lord of hosts.

The angel... Viz., the minister and messenger.

2:8. But you have departed out of the way, and have caused many to
stumble at the law: you have made void the covenant of Levi, saith the
Lord of hosts.

2:9. Therefore have I also made you contemptible, and base before all
people, as you have not kept my ways, and have accepted persons in the
law.

2:10. Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why then
doth every one of us despise his brother, violating the covenant of our
fathers?

2:11. Juda hath transgressed, and abomination hath been committed in
Israel, and in Jerusalem: for Juda hath profaned the holiness of the
Lord, which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.

2:12. The Lord will cut off the man that hath done this, both the
master, and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that
offereth an offering to the Lord of hosts.

2:13. And this again have you done, you have covered the altar of the
Lord with tears, with weeping, and bellowing, so that I have no more a
regard to sacrifice, neither do I accept any atonement at your hands.

With tears... Viz., by occasion of your wives, whom you have put away:
and who came to weep and lament before the altar.

2:14. And you have said: For what cause? Because the Lord hath been
witness between thee, and the wife of thy youth, whom thou hast
despised: yet she was thy partner, and the wife of thy covenant.

2:15. Did not one make her, and she is the residue of his spirit? And
what doth one seek, but the seed of God? Keep then your spirit, and
despise not the wife of thy youth.

2:16. When thon shalt hate her put her away, saith the Lord, the God of
lsrael: but iniquity shalt cover his garment, saith the Lord of hosts,
keep your spirit, and despise not.

Iniquity shall cover his garment... Viz., of every man that putteth away
his wife without just cause; notwithstanding that God permitted it in
the law, to prevent the evil of murder.

2:17. You have wearied the Lord with your words, and you said: Wherein
have we wearied him? In that you say: Every one that doth evil, is good
in the sight of the Lord, and such please him: or surely where is the
God of judgment?

Malachias Chapter 3

Christ shall come to his temple, and purify the priesthood. They that
continue in their evil ways shall be punished: but true penitents shall
receive a blessing.

3:1. Behold I send my angel, and he shall prepare the way before my
face. And presently the Lord, whom you seek, and the angel of the
testament, whom you desire, shall come to his temple. Behold, he cometh,
saith the Lord of hosts.

My angel... Viz., John the Baptist, the messenger of God, and forerunner
of Christ.

3:2. And who shall be able to think of the day of his coming? and who
shall stand to see him? for he is like a refining fire, and like the
fuller's herb:

3:3. And he shall sit refining and cleansing the silver, and he shall
purify the sons of Levi, and shall refine them as gold, and as silver,
and they shall offer sacrifices to the Lord in justice.

3:4. And the sacrifice of Juda and of Jerusalem shall please the Lord,
as in the days of old, and in the ancient years.

3:5. And I will come to you in judgment, and will be a speedy witness
against sorcerers, and adulterers, and false swearers, and them that
oppress the hireling in his wages, the widows, and the fatherless: and
oppress the stranger, and have not feared me, saith the Lord of hosts.

3:6. For I am the Lord, and I change not: and you the sons of Jacob are
not consumed.

3:7. For from the days of your fathers you have departed from my
ordinances, and have not kept them: Return to me, and I will return to
you, saith the Lord of hosts. And you have said: Wherein shall we
return?

3:8. Shall a man afflict God, for you afflict me. And you have said:
Wherein do we afflict thee? in tithes and in firstfruits.

3:9. And you are cursed with want, and you afflict me, even the whole
nation of you.

3:10. Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat
in my house, and try me in this, saith the Lord: if I open not unto you
the flood-gates of heaven, and pour you out a blessing even to
abundance.

3:11. And I will rebuke for your sakes the devourer, and he shall not
spoil the fruit of your land: neither shall the vine in the field be
barren, saith the Lord of hosts.

3:12. And all nations shall call you blessed: for you shall be a
delightful land, saith the Lord of hosts.

3:13. Your words have been unsufferable to me, saith the Lord.

3:14. And you have said: What have we spoken against thee? You have
said: He laboureth in vain that serveth God, and what profit is it that
we have kept his ordinances, and that we have walked sorrowful before
the Lord of hosts?

3:15. Wherefore now we call the proud people happy, for they that work
wickedness are built up, and they have tempted God and are preserved.

3:16. Then they that feared the Lord, spoke every one with his
neighbour: and the Lord gave ear, and heard it: and a book of
remembrance was written before him for them that fear the Lord, and
think on his name.

3:17. And they shall be my special possession, saith the Lord of hosts,
in the day that I do judgment: and I will spare them, as a man spareth
his son that serveth him.

3:18. And you shall return, and shall see the difference between the
just and the wicked: and between him that serveth God, and him that
serveth him not.

Malachias Chapter 4

The judgment of the wicked, and reward of the just. An exhortation to
observe the law. Elias shall come for the conversion of the Jews.

4:1. For behold the day shall come kindled as a furnace: and all the
proud, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble: and the day that
cometh shall set them on fire, saith the Lord of hosts, it shall not
leave them root, nor branch.

4:2. But unto you that fear my name, the Sun of justice shall arise, and
health in his wings: and you shall go forth, and shall leap like calves
of the herd.

4:3. And you shall tread down the wicked when they shall be ashes under
the sole of your feet in the day that I do this, saith the Lord of
hosts.  4:4. Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded him
in Horeb for all Israel, the precepts, and judgments.

4:5. Behold, I will send you Elias the prophet, before the coming of the
great and dreadful day of the Lord.

4:6. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the
heart of the children to their fathers: lest I come, and strike the
earth with anathema.

He shall turn the heart, etc... By bringing over the Jews to the faith
of Christ, he shall reconcile them to their fathers, viz., the
partiarchs and prophets; whose hearts for many ages have been turned
away from them, because of their refusing to believe in Christ.-Ibid.
With anathema... In the Hebrew, Cherem, that is, with utter destruction.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
