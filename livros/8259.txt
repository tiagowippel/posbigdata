Book 32 Jonah
001:001 Now the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
001:002 "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach against it,
        for their wickedness has come up before me."
001:003 But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh.
        He went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish;
        so he paid its fare, and went down into it, to go with them
        to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh.
001:004 But Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea, and there
        was a mighty storm on the sea, so that the ship was likely
        to break up.
001:005 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god.
        They threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea,
        to lighten it.  But Jonah had gone down into the innermost parts
        of the ship, and he was laying down, and was fast asleep.
001:006 So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, "What do
        you mean, sleeper?  Arise, call on your God{or, gods}!
        Maybe your God{or, gods} will notice us, so that we won't perish."
001:007 They all said to each other, "Come, let us cast lots,
        that we may know for whose cause this evil is on us."
        So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.
001:008 Then they asked him, "Tell us, please, for whose cause this evil
        is on us.  What is your occupation?  Where do you come from?
        What is your country?  Of what people are you?"
001:009 He said to them, "I am a Hebrew, and I fear Yahweh, the God
        of heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land."
001:010 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him, "What is
        this that you have done?"  For the men knew that he was fleeing
        from the presence of Yahweh, because he had told them.
001:011 Then said they to him, "What shall we do to you, that the sea
        may be calm to us?"  For the sea grew more and more stormy.
001:012 He said to them, "Take me up, and throw me into the sea.
        Then the sea will be calm for you; for I know that because of me
        this great storm is on you."
001:013 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land;
        but they could not, for the sea grew more and more
        stormy against them.
001:014 Therefore they cried to Yahweh, and said, "We beg you,
        Yahweh, we beg you, let us not perish for this man's life,
        and don't lay on us innocent blood; for you, Yahweh, have done
        as it pleased you."
001:015 So they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea
        ceased its raging.
001:016 Then the men feared Yahweh exceedingly; and they offered
        a sacrifice to Yahweh, and made vows.
001:017 Yahweh prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah
        was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
002:001 Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish's belly.
002:002 He said, "I called because of my affliction to Yahweh.
        He answered me.  Out of the belly of Sheol I cried.
        You heard my voice.
002:003 For you threw me into the depths, in the heart of the seas.
        The flood was all around me.  All your waves and your billows
        passed over me.
002:004 I said, 'I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look
        again toward your holy temple.'
002:005 The waters surrounded me, even to the soul.  The deep was around me.
        The weeds were wrapped around my head.
002:006 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains.  The earth barred
        me in forever:  yet have you brought up my life from the pit,
        Yahweh my God.
002:007 "When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh.
        My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.
002:008 Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
002:009 But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving.
        I will pay that which I have vowed.  Salvation belongs to Yahweh."
002:010 Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.
003:001 The word of Yahweh came to Jonah the second time, saying,
003:002 "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it
        the message that I give you."
003:003 So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to the word
        of Yahweh.  Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city,
        three days' journey across.
003:004 Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried out,
        and said, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!"
003:005 The people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast,
        and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to
        the least of them.
003:006 The news reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne,
        and took off his royal robe, covered himself with sackcloth,
        and sat in ashes.
003:007 He made a proclamation and published through Nineveh by the
        decree of the king and his nobles, saying, "Let neither man
        nor animal, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed,
        nor drink water;
003:008 but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and animal,
        and let them cry mightily to God.  Yes, let them turn everyone
        from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.
003:009 Who knows whether God will not turn and relent, and turn away
        from his fierce anger, so that we might not perish?"
003:010 God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way.
        God relented of the disaster which he said he would do to them,
        and he didn't do it.
004:001 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.
004:002 He prayed to Yahweh, and said, "Please, Yahweh, wasn't this what I
        said when I was still in my own country?  Therefore I hurried
        to flee to Tarshish, for I knew that you are a gracious God,
        and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,
        and you relent of doing harm.
004:003 Therefore now, Yahweh, take, I beg you, my life from me;
        for it is better for me to die than to live."
004:004 Yahweh said, "Is it right for you to be angry?"
004:005 Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city,
        and there made himself a booth, and sat under it in the shade,
        until he might see what would become of the city.
004:006 Yahweh God prepared a vine, and made it to come up over Jonah,
        that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him
        from his discomfort.  So Jonah was exceedingly glad because
        of the vine.
004:007 But God prepared a worm at dawn the next day, and it chewed
        on the vine, so that it withered.
004:008 It happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry
        east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah's head, so that he fainted,
        and requested for himself that he might die, and said,
        "It is better for me to die than to live."
004:009 God said to Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry about the vine?"
        He said, "I am right to be angry, even to death."
004:010 Yahweh said, "You have been concerned for the vine,
        for which you have not labored, neither made it grow;
        which came up in a night, and perished in a night.
004:011 Shouldn't I be concerned for Nineveh, that great city,
        in which are more than one hundred twenty thousand persons
        who can't discern between their right hand and their left hand;
        and also much livestock?"

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
