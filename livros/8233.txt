Book 06 Joshua
001:001 Now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh,
        that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying,
001:002 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan,
        you, and all this people, to the land which I give to them,
        even to the children of Israel.
001:003 I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will
        tread on, as I told Moses.
001:004 From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river,
        the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites,
        and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun,
        shall be your border.
001:005 No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life.
        As I was with Moses, so I will be with you.  I will not fail
        you nor forsake you.
001:006 Be strong and of good courage; for you shall cause this
        people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers
        to give them.
001:007 Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according
        to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded you.
        Don't turn from it to the right hand or to the left,
        that you may have good success wherever you go.
001:008 This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth,
        but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may
        observe to do according to all that is written therein:
        for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you
        shall have good success.
001:009 Haven't I commanded you?  Be strong and of good courage.
        Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed:  for Yahweh your God
        is with you wherever you go.
001:010 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
001:011 "Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people,
        saying, 'Prepare food; for within three days you are to pass
        over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh
        your God gives you to possess it.'"
001:012 Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to
        the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,
001:013 "Remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh
        commanded you, saying, 'Yahweh your God gives you rest,
        and will give you this land.
001:014 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock, shall live
        in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but you
        shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty
        men of valor, and shall help them
001:015 until Yahweh has given your brothers rest, as he has given you,
        and they have also possessed the land which Yahweh your God
        gives them.  Then you shall return to the land of your possession,
        and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you
        beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.'"
001:016 They answered Joshua, saying, "All that you have commanded us
        we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
001:017 Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you.
        Only may Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses.
001:018 Whoever rebels against your commandment, and doesn't listen to your
        words in all that you command him, he shall be put to death.
        Only be strong and of good courage."
002:001 Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim
        as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, and Jericho."
        They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name
        was Rahab, and slept there.
002:002 The king of Jericho was told, "Behold, men of the children
        of Israel came in here tonight to spy out the land."
002:003 The king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men
        who have come to you, who have entered into your house;
        for they have come to spy out all the land."
002:004 The woman took the two men and hid them.  Then she said, "Yes,
        the men came to me, but I didn't know where they came from.
002:005 It happened about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it
        was dark, that the men went out.  Where the men went, I don't know.
        Pursue them quickly; for you will overtake them."
002:006 But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with
        the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.
002:007 The men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords:
        and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out,
        they shut the gate.
002:008 Before they had laid down, she came up to them on the roof;
002:009 and she said to the men, "I know that Yahweh has given
        you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen on us,
        and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
002:010 For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the
        Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} before you, when you came out of Egypt;
        and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond
        the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
002:011 As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did
        there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you:
        for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above,
        and on earth beneath.
002:012 Now therefore, please swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt
        kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my
        father's house, and give me a true token;
002:013 and that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers,
        and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver
        our lives from death."
002:014 The men said to her, "Our life for yours, if you don't talk
        about this business of ours; and it shall be, when Yahweh gives
        us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you."
002:015 Then she let them down by a cord through the window;
        for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived
        on the wall.
002:016 She said to them, "Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you;
        and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers
        have returned.  Afterward, you may go your way."
002:017 The men said to her, "We will be guiltless of this your oath
        which you have made us to swear.
002:018 Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line
        of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by.
        You shall gather to yourself into the house your father,
        your mother, your brothers, and all your father's household.
002:019 It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into
        the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless.
        Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head,
        if any hand is on him.
002:020 But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall
        be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear."
002:021 She said, "According to your words, so be it."  She sent them away,
        and they departed.  She tied the scarlet line in the window.
002:022 They went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days,
        until the pursuers had returned.  The pursuers sought them
        throughout all the way, but didn't find them.
002:023 Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain,
        passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told
        him all that had happened to them.
002:024 They said to Joshua, "Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands
        all the land.  Moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt
        away before us."
003:001 Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they moved from Shittim,
        and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel.
        They lodged there before they passed over.
003:002 It happened after three days, that the officers went through
        the midst of the camp;
003:003 and they commanded the people, saying, "When you see the ark
        of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and the priests
        the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place,
        and follow it.
003:004 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two
        thousand cubits by measure.  Don't come near to it, that you
        may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed
        this way before."
003:005 Joshua said to the people, "Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow
        Yahweh will do wonders among you."
003:006 Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, "Take up the ark
        of the covenant, and pass over before the people."
        They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
003:007 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to magnify you
        in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I
        was with Moses, so I will be with you.
003:008 You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant,
        saying, 'When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan,
        you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"
003:009 Joshua said to the children of Israel, "Come here, and hear
        the words of Yahweh your God."
003:010 Joshua said, "Hereby you shall know that the living God is
        among you, and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite,
        and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite,
        and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite out
        from before you.
003:011 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth
        passes over before you into the Jordan.
003:012 Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
        for every tribe a man.
003:013 It shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests
        who bear the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth,
        rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan
        will be cut off, even the waters that come down from above;
        and they shall stand in one heap."
003:014 It happened, when the people moved from their tents to pass
        over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant
        being before the people,
003:015 and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan,
        and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped
        in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its
        banks all the time of harvest),
003:016 that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose
        up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is
        beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea
        of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off.
        Then the people passed over right against Jericho.
003:017 The priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh
        stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan;
        and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation
        had passed completely over the Jordan.
004:001 It happened, when all the nation had completely passed over
        the Jordan, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
004:002 "Take twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
004:003 and command them, saying, 'Take from out of the middle of
        the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm,
        twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them
        down in the lodging place, where you will lodge tonight.'"
004:004 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared
        of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man.
004:005 Joshua said to them, "Pass over before the ark of Yahweh your
        God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you pick up
        a stone and put it on your shoulder, according to the number
        of the tribes of the children of Israel;
004:006 that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask
        in time to come, saying, 'What do you mean by these stones?'
004:007 then you shall tell them, 'Because the waters of the Jordan
        were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
        When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were
        cut off.  These stones shall be for a memorial to the children
        of Israel forever.'"
004:008 The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve
        stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua,
        according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;
        and they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged,
        and laid them down there.
004:009 Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan,
        in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark
        of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.
004:010 For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan,
        until everything was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak
        to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua;
        and the people hurried and passed over.
004:011 It happened, when all the people had completely passed over,
        that the ark of Yahweh passed over, with the priests,
        in the presence of the people.
004:012 The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe
        of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel,
        as Moses spoke to them.
004:013 About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war passed
        over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of Jericho.
004:014 On that day, Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;
        and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days
        of his life.
004:015 Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
004:016 "Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony,
        that they come up out of the Jordan."
004:017 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, "Come up out
        of the Jordan!"
004:018 It happened, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant
        of Yahweh had come up out of the middle of the Jordan,
        and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground,
        that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place,
        and went over all its banks, as before.
004:019 The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day
        of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east
        border of Jericho.
004:020 Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of
        the Jordan, n Gilgal.
004:021 He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, "When your
        children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, 'What do
        these stones mean?'
004:022 Then you shall let your children know, saying, 'Israel came
        over this Jordan on dry land.
004:023 For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from
        before you, until you had passed over, as Yahweh your God
        did to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}, which he dried up
        from before us, until we had passed over;
004:024 that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh,
        that it is mighty; that you may fear Yahweh your God forever.'"
005:001 It happened, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond
        the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites,
        who were by the sea, heard how that Yahweh had dried up
        the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel,
        until we had passed over, that their heart melted, neither was
        there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
005:002 At that time, Yahweh said to Joshua, "Make flint knives,
        and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time."
005:003 Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the children
        of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
005:004 This is the reason Joshua circumcised:  all the people who came
        out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war,
        died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
005:005 For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all
        the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they
        came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
005:006 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,
        until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt,
        were consumed, because they didn't listen to the voice of Yahweh.
        Yahweh swore to them that he wouldn't let them see the land
        which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us,
        a land flowing with milk and honey.
005:007 Their children, whom he raised up in their place,
        were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised,
        because they had not circumcised them on the way.
005:008 It happened, when they were done circumcising all the nation,
        that they stayed in their places in the camp until
        they were healed.
005:009 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach
        of Egypt from off you."  Therefore the name of that place
        was called Gilgal,{"Gilgal" sounds like the Hebrew for "roll."
        } to this day.
005:010 The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal.  They kept
        the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening
        in the plains of Jericho.
005:011 They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce
        of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day.
005:012 The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce
        of the land.  The children of Israel didn't have manna any more;
        but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
005:013 It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up
        his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him
        with his sword drawn in his hand.  Joshua went to him,
        and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"
005:014 He said, "No; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh's army."
        Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped,
        and said to him, "What does my lord say to his servant?"
005:015 The prince of Yahweh's army said to Joshua, "Take your shoes
        off of your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy."
        Joshua did so.
006:001 Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel.
        No one went out, and no one came in.
006:002 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand,
        with its king and the mighty men of valor.
006:003 All your men of war shall march around the city, going around
        the city once.  You shall do this six days.
006:004 Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before
        the ark.  On the seventh day, you shall march around the city
        seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
006:005 It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn,
        and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people
        shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city
        shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man
        straight before him."
006:006 Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them,
        "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear
        seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh."
006:007 They said to the people, "Advance!  March around the city,
        and let the armed men pass on before Yahweh's ark."
006:008 It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people,
        the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
        horns before Yahweh advanced, and blew the trumpets;
        and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them.
006:009 The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets,
        and the ark went after them.  The trumpets sounded as they went.
006:010 Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout,
        nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed
        out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout.
        Then you shall shout."
006:011 So he caused the ark of Yahweh to go around the city,
        going about it once.  Then they came into the camp, and lodged
        in the camp.
006:012 Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up
        the ark of Yahweh.
006:013 The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
        horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually,
        and blew the trumpets:  and the armed men went before them.
        The rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh.  The trumpets
        sounded as they went.
006:014 The second day they marched around the city once, and returned
        into the camp.  They did this six days.
006:015 It happened on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning
        of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times.
        Only on this day they marched around the city seven times.
006:016 It happened at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets,
        Joshua said to the people, "Shout, for Yahweh has given
        you the city!
006:017 The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh.
        Only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with
        her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
006:018 But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing,
        lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing;
        so would you make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.
006:019 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
        are holy to Yahweh.  They shall come into Yahweh's treasury."
006:020 So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets.
        It happened, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,
        that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall
        fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city,
        every man straight before him, and they took the city.
006:021 They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man
        and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey,
        with the edge of the sword.
006:022 Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land,
        "Go into the prostitute's house, and bring out from there
        the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her."
006:023 The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab
        with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had.
        They also brought out all her relatives, and they set them
        outside of the camp of Israel.
006:024 They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it.
        Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of brass
        and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh's house.
006:025 But Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all
        that she had, Joshua saved alive.  She lived in the midst
        of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers,
        whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
006:026 Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, "Cursed be
        the man before Yahweh, who rises up and builds this city Jericho.
        With the loss of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation,
        and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates."
006:027 So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.
007:001 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing;
        for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son
        of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing:
        and the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the children of Israel.
007:002 Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven,
        on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up
        and spy out the land.  The men went up and spied out Ai.
007:003 They returned to Joshua, and said to him, Don't let all
        the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go
        up and strike Ai; don't make all the people to toil there;
        for they are but few.
007:004 So there went up there of the people about three thousand men:
        and they fled before the men of Ai.
007:005 The men of Ai struck of them about thirty-six men; and they
        chased them [from] before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck
        them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted,
        and became as water.
007:006 Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before
        the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel;
        and they put dust on their heads.
007:007 Joshua said, Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you at all brought
        this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand
        of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been
        content and lived beyond the Jordan!
007:008 Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned
        their backs before their enemies!
007:009 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will
        hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name
        from the earth:  and what will you do for your great name?
007:010 Yahweh said to Joshua, Get you up; why are you thus fallen
        on your face?
007:011 Israel has sinned; yes, they have even transgressed my
        covenant which I commanded them:  yes, they have even taken
        of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also;
        and they have even put it among their own stuff.
007:012 Therefore the children of Israel can't stand before their enemies;
        they turn their backs before their enemies, because they
        are become accursed:  I will not be with you any more,
        except you destroy the devoted thing from among you.
007:013 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves
        against tomorrow:  for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, There is
        a devoted thing in the midst of you, Israel; you can not stand
        before your enemies, until you take away the devoted thing
        from among you.
007:014 In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes:
        and it shall be, that the tribe which Yahweh takes shall come
        near by families; and the family which Yahweh shall take
        shall come near by households; and the household which Yahweh
        shall take shall come near man by man.
007:015 It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall
        be burnt with fire, he and all that he has; because he has
        transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has done
        folly in Israel.
007:016 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel
        near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
007:017 and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family
        of the Zerahites:  and he brought near the family of the Zerahites
        man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
007:018 and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan,
        the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah,
        of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
007:019 Joshua said to Achan, My son, please give glory to Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me
        now what you have done; don't hide it from me.
007:020 Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned
        against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
007:021 when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonian mantle,
        and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold
        of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them;
        and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent,
        and the silver under it.
007:022 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and, behold,
        it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
007:023 They took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them
        to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel; and they laid
        them down before Yahweh.
007:024 Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,
        and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold,
        and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys,
        and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had:
        and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.
007:025 Joshua said, Why have you troubled us?  Yahweh shall
        trouble you this day.  All Israel stoned him with stones;
        and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.
007:026 They raised over him a great heap of stones, to this day;
        and Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger.
        Therefore the name of that place was called "The valley of Achor"
        to this day.
008:001 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed:
        take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up
        to Ai; behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai,
        and his people, and his city, and his land;
008:002 You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king:
        only the spoil of it, and the livestock of it, shall you
        take for a prey to yourselves:  set you an ambush for the
        city behind it.
008:003 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai:
        and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor,
        and sent them forth by night.
008:004 He commanded them, saying, Behold, you shall lie in ambush against
        the city, behind the city; don't go very far from the city,
        but be all ready:
008:005 and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city.
        It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first,
        that we will flee before them;
008:006 and they will come out after us, until we have drawn them
        away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us,
        as at the first:  so we will flee before them;
008:007 and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of
        the city:  for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand.
008:008 It shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set
        the city on fire; according to the word of Yahweh shall you do:
        behold, I have commanded you.
008:009 Joshua sent them forth; and they went to set up the ambush,
        and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai:
        but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
008:010 Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people,
        and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
008:011 All the people, [even] the [men of] war who were with him,
        went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped
        on the north side of Ai:  now there was a valley between
        him and Ai.
008:012 He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between
        Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
008:013 So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north
        of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city;
        and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
008:014 It happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried
        and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against
        Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed,
        before the Arabah; but he didn't know that there was an ambush
        against him behind the city.
008:015 Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them,
        and fled by the way of the wilderness.
008:016 All the people who were in the city were called together
        to pursue after them:  and they pursued after Joshua,
        and were drawn away from the city.
008:017 There was not a man left in Ai or Beth El, who didn't
        go out after Israel:  and they left the city open,
        and pursued after Israel.
008:018 Yahweh said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in
        your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand.
        Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand
        toward the city.
008:019 The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon
        as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city,
        and took it; and they hurried and set the city on fire.
008:020 When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold,
        the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no
        power to flee this way or that way:  and the people who fled
        to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.
008:021 When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city,
        and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again,
        and killed the men of Ai.
008:022 The others came forth out of the city against them;
        so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side,
        and some on that side:  and they struck them, so that they
        let none of them remain or escape.
008:023 The king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
008:024 It happened, when Israel had made an end of killing all the
        inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they
        pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword,
        until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai,
        and struck it with the edge of the sword.
008:025 All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand,
        even all the men of Ai.
008:026 For Joshua didn't draw back his hand, with which he stretched
        out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the
        inhabitants of Ai.
008:027 Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took
        for prey to themselves, according to the word of Yahweh
        which he commanded Joshua.
008:028 So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation,
        to this day.
008:029 The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the evening:
        and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they
        took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance
        of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap
        of stones, to this day.
008:030 Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        in Mount Ebal,
008:031 as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded the children of Israel,
        as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar
        of uncut stones, on which no man had lifted up any iron:
        and they offered thereon burnt offerings to Yahweh,
        and sacrificed peace offerings.
008:032 He wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
        which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.
008:033 All Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges,
        stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests
        the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
        as well the foreigner as the native; half of them in front
        of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal;
        as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first,
        that they should bless the people of Israel.
008:034 Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing
        and the curse, according to all that is written in the book
        of the law.
008:035 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
        didn't read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women,
        and the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them.
009:001 It happened, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan,
        in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore
        of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite,
        the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
        heard of it;
009:002 that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua
        and with Israel, with one accord.
009:003 But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
        to Jericho and to Ai,
009:004 they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they
        had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys,
        and wineskins, old and torn and bound up,
009:005 and old and patched shoes on their feet, and old garments on them;
        and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become moldy.
009:006 They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him,
        and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country:
        now therefore make you a covenant with us.
009:007 The men of Israel said to the Hivites, What if you dwell among us;
        and how shall we make a covenant with you?
009:008 They said to Joshua, We are your servants.  Joshua said to them,
        Who are you? and from whence come you?
009:009 They said to him, From a very far country your servants
        are come because of the name of Yahweh your God:
        for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
009:010 and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites,
        who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon,
        and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
009:011 Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke
        to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey,
        and go to meet them, and tell them, We are your servants:
        and now make you a covenant with us.
009:012 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses
        on the day we came forth to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry,
        and is become moldy:
009:013 and these wineskins, which we filled, were new; and behold,
        they are torn:  and these our garments and our shoes are become
        old by reason of the very long journey.
009:014 The men took of their provision, and didn't ask counsel at
        the mouth of Yahweh.
009:015 Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them,
        to let them live:  and the princes of the congregation
        swore to them.
009:016 It happened at the end of three days after they had made a covenant
        with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors,
        and that they lived among them.
009:017 The children of Israel traveled, and came to their cities on
        the third day.  Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah,
        and Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.
009:018 The children of Israel didn't strike them, because the princes
        of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel.
        All the congregation murmured against the princes.
009:019 But all the princes said to all the congregation,
        We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel:
        now therefore we may not touch them.
009:020 This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us,
        because of the oath which we swore to them.
009:021 The princes said to them, Let them live:  so they became
        wood cutters and drawers of water to all the congregation,
        as the princes had spoken to them.
009:022 Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying,
        Why have you deceived us, saying, We are very far from you;
        when you dwell among us?
009:023 Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall never fail to be
        of you bondservants, both wood cutters and drawers of water
        for the house of my God.
009:024 They answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
        told your servants, how that Yahweh your God commanded
        his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to
        destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you;
        therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you,
        and have done this thing.
009:025 Now, behold, we are in your hand:  as it seems good and right
        to you to do to us, do.
009:026 So did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of
        the children of Israel, that they didn't kill them.
009:027 That day Joshua made those wood cutters and drawers of water
        for the congregation, and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day,
        in the place which he should choose.
010:001 Now it happened, when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua
        had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done
        to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king;
        and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel,
        and were among them;
010:002 that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city,
        as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai,
        and all the men of it were mighty.
010:003 Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron,
        and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish,
        and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
010:004 Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for it
        has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
010:005 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
        the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish,
        the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up,
        they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon,
        and made war against it.
010:006 The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
        saying, Don't slack your hand from your servants;
        come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us:
        for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill
        country are gathered together against us.
010:007 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
        with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
010:008 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't fear them:  for I have delivered
        them into your hands; there shall not a man of them
        stand before you.
010:009 Joshua therefore came on them suddenly; [for] he went up
        from Gilgal all the night.
010:010 Yahweh confused them before Israel, and he killed them
        with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way
        of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah,
        and to Makkedah.
010:011 It happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they
        were at the descent of Beth Horon, that Yahweh cast down
        great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died:
        they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom
        the children of Israel killed with the sword.
010:012 Then spoke Joshua to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh
        delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel;
        and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand you still
        on Gibeon; You, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.
010:013 The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, Until the nation
        had avenged themselves of their enemies.  Isn't this written
        in the book of Jashar?  The sun stayed in the midst of the sky,
        and didn't hurry to go down about a whole day.
010:014 There was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh
        listened to the voice of a man:  for Yahweh fought for Israel.
010:015 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
010:016 These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
010:017 It was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found,
        hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
010:018 Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave,
        and set men by it to keep them:
010:019 but don't stay; pursue after your enemies, and strike the hindmost
        of them; don't allow them to enter into their cities:
        for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand.
010:020 It happened, when Joshua and the children of Israel had
        made an end of killing them with a very great slaughter,
        until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained
        of them had entered into the fortified cities,
010:021 that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at
        Makkedah in peace:  none moved his tongue against any of
        the children of Israel.
010:022 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth
        those five kings to me out of the cave.
010:023 They did so, and brought forth those five kings to him out
        of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron,
        the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
010:024 It happened, when they brought forth those kings to Joshua,
        that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said
        to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him,
        Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.
        They came near, and put their feet on the necks of them.
010:025 Joshua said to them, Don't be afraid, nor be dismayed;
        be strong and of good courage:  for thus shall Yahweh do
        to all your enemies against whom you fight.
010:026 Afterward Joshua struck them, and put them to death, and hanged
        them on five trees:  and they were hanging on the trees
        until the evening.
010:027 It happened at the time of the going down of the sun,
        that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees,
        and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves,
        and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, to this very day.
010:028 Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge
        of the sword, and the king of it:  he utterly destroyed them
        and all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining;
        and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the
        king of Jericho.
010:029 Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah,
        and fought against Libnah:
010:030 and Yahweh delivered it also, and the king of it, into the hand
        of Israel; and he struck it with the edge of the sword,
        and all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining in it;
        and he did to the king of it as he had done to the king of Jericho.
010:031 Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish,
        and encamped against it, and fought against it:
010:032 and Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel;
        and he took it on the second day, and struck it with
        the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were therein,
        according to all that he had done to Libnah.
010:033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
        struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
010:034 Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon;
        and they encamped against it, and fought against it;
010:035 and they took it on that day, and struck it with the edge
        of the sword; and all the souls who were therein he utterly
        destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
010:036 Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron;
        and they fought against it:
010:037 and they took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,
        and the king of it, and all the cities of it, and all the souls
        who were therein; he left none remaining, according to all
        that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it,
        and all the souls who were therein.
010:038 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir,
        and fought against it:
010:039 and he took it, and the king of it, and all the cities of it;
        and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly
        destroyed all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining:
        as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king of it;
        as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king of it.
010:040 So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, and the South,
        and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings:
        he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed,
        as Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded.
010:041 Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all
        the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.
010:042 All these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
        because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
010:043 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
011:001 It happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent
        to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron,
        and to the king of Achshaph,
011:002 and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country,
        and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland,
        and in the heights of Dor on the west,
011:003 to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite,
        and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the
        hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
011:004 They went out, they and all their armies with them, much people,
        even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude,
        with horses and chariots very many.
011:005 All these kings met together; and they came and encamped
        together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
011:006 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid because of them;
        for tomorrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain
        before Israel:  you shall hamstring their horses, and burn
        their chariots with fire.
011:007 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them
        by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell on them.
011:008 Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them,
        and chased them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth Maim,
        and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they struck them,
        until they left them none remaining.
011:009 Joshua did to them as Yahweh bade him:  he hamstrung their horses,
        and burnt their chariots with fire.
011:010 Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck
        the king of it with the sword:  for Hazor before was the head
        of all those kingdoms.
011:011 They struck all the souls who were therein with the edge of the sword,
        utterly destroying them; there was none left who breathed:
        and he burnt Hazor with fire.
011:012 All the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
        did Joshua take, and he struck them with the edge of
        the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant
        of Yahweh commanded.
011:013 But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned
        none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
011:014 All the spoil of these cities, and the livestock, the children
        of Israel took for a prey to themselves; but every man they
        struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them,
        neither left they any who breathed.
011:015 As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua:
        and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that
        Yahweh commanded Moses.
011:016 So Joshua took all that land, the hill country, and all the South,
        and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah,
        and the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;
011:017 from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad
        in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon:  and all their
        kings he took, and struck them, and put them to death.
011:018 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
011:019 There was not a city that made peace with the children
        of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon:
        they took all in battle.
011:020 For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against
        Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them,
        that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them,
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
011:021 Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the
        hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from
        all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country
        of Israel:  Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
011:022 There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children
        of Israel:  only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod,
        did some remain.
011:023 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh
        spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance
        to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes.
        The land had rest from war.
012:001 Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of
        Israel struck, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward
        the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon,
        and all the Arabah eastward:
012:002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled
        from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        and [the city that is in] the middle of the valley, and half Gilead,
        even to the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;
012:003 and the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and to
        the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way
        to Beth Jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:
012:004 and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim,
        who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
012:005 and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan,
        to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites,
        and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
012:006 Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them:
        and Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it for a possession to
        the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
012:007 These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children
        of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal Gad in
        the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir;
        and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession
        according to their divisions;
012:008 in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah,
        and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South;
        the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite,
        the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
012:009 the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
012:010 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
012:011 the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
012:012 the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
012:013 the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
012:014 the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
012:015 the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
012:016 the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
012:017 the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
012:018 the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;
012:019 the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
012:020 the king of Shimron Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
012:021 the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
012:022 the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
012:023 the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim
        in Gilgal, one;
012:024 the king of Tirzah, one:  all the kings thirty-one.
013:001 Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Yahweh said
        to him, You are old and well stricken in years, and there
        remains yet very much land to be possessed.
013:002 This is the land that yet remains:  all the regions of
        the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
013:003 from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border
        of Ekron northward, [which] is reckoned to the Canaanites;
        the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites,
        the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites;
        also the Avvim,
013:004 on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
        that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the border
        of the Amorites;
013:005 and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise,
        from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath;
013:006 all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to
        Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive
        out from before the children of Israel:  only allot you it
        to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
013:007 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes,
        and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
013:008 With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance,
        which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses
        the servant of Yahweh gave them:
013:009 from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all
        the plain of Medeba to Dibon;
013:010 and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned
        in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;
013:011 and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites,
        and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;
013:012 all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth
        and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim);
        for these did Moses strike, and drove them out.
013:013 Nevertheless the children of Israel didn't drive out the Geshurites,
        nor the Maacathites:  but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst
        of Israel to this day.
013:014 Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings
        of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance,
        as he spoke to him.
013:015 Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according
        to their families.
013:016 Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley
        of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley,
        and all the plain by Medeba;
013:017 Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon,
        and Bamoth Baal, and Beth Baal Meon,
013:018 and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
013:019 and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth Shahar in the mount
        of the valley,
013:020 and Beth Peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth,
013:021 and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon
        king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck
        with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur,
        and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.
013:022 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children
        of Israel kill with the sword among the rest of their slain.
013:023 The border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border
        [of it]. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben
        according to their families, the cities and the villages of it.
013:024 Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad,
        according to their families.
013:025 Their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead,
        and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that
        is before Rabbah;
013:026 and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim
        to the border of Debir;
013:027 and in the valley, Beth Haram, and Beth Nimrah, and Succoth,
        and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon,
        the Jordan and the border [of it], to the uttermost part
        of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.
013:028 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according
        to their families, the cities and the villages of it.
013:029 Moses gave [inheritance] to the half-tribe of Manasseh:
        and it was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh
        according to their families.
013:030 Their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
        of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are
        in Bashan, sixty cities:
013:031 and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of
        the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir
        the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children
        of Machir according to their families.
013:032 These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains
        of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.
013:033 But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance:  Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spoke to them.
014:001 These are the inheritances which the children of Israel
        took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest,
        and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers'
        [houses] of the tribes of the children of Israel,
        distributed to them,
014:002 by the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses,
        for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
014:003 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and
        the half-tribe beyond the Jordan:  but to the Levites he gave
        no inheritance among them.
014:004 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
        and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land,
        save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs of it for their
        livestock and for their substance.
014:005 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did;
        and they divided the land.
014:006 Then the children of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal:
        and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him,
        You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God
        concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.
014:007 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent
        me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him
        word again as it was in my heart.
014:008 Nevertheless my brothers who went up with me made the heart
        of the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh my God.
014:009 Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
        your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance to you and
        to your children forever, because you have wholly followed
        Yahweh my God.
014:010 Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive, as he spoke,
        these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke
        this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness:
        and now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old.
014:011 As yet I am as strong this day as I as in the day that Moses sent me:
        as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war,
        and to go out and to come in.
014:012 Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke
        in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there,
        and cities great and fortified:  it may be that Yahweh will
        be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh spoke.
014:013 Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son
        of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
014:014 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son
        of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because that he wholly
        followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.
014:015 Now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba;
        [which Arba was] the greatest man among the Anakim.
        The land had rest from war.
015:001 The lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their
        families was to the border of Edom, even to the wilderness
        of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.
015:002 Their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea,
        from the bay that looks southward;
015:003 and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed
        along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea,
        and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned
        about to Karka;
015:004 and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook
        of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea:
        this shall be your south border.
015:005 The east border was the Salt Sea, even to the end of the Jordan.
        The border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea
        at the end of the Jordan;
015:006 and the border went up to Beth Hoglah, and passed along by
        the north of Beth Arabah; and the border went up to the stone
        of Bohan the son of Reuben;
015:007 and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor,
        and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against
        the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river;
        and the border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh,
        and the goings out of it were at En Rogel;
015:008 and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom
        to the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem);
        and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies
        before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost
        part of the valley of Rephaim northward;
015:009 and the border extended from the top of the mountain
        to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to
        the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah
        (the same is Kiriath Jearim);
015:010 and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir,
        and passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north
        (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth Shemesh,
        and passed along by Timnah;
015:011 and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward;
        and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along
        to Mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings
        out of the border were at the sea.
015:012 The west border was to the great sea, and the border [of it].
        This is the border of the children of Judah round about
        according to their families.
015:013 To Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children
        of Judah, according to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua,
        even Kiriath Arba, [which Arba was] the father of Anak
        (the same is Hebron).
015:014 Caleb drove out there the three sons of Anak:  Sheshai, and Ahiman,
        and Talmai, the children of Anak.
015:015 He went up there against the inhabitants of Debir:
        now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.
015:016 Caleb said, He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.
015:017 Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:
        and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
015:018 It happened, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask
        of her father a field:  and she alighted from off her donkey;
        and Caleb said, What would you?
015:019 She said, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me
        in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.
        He gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
015:020 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
        according to their families.
015:021 The uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
        toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel,
        and Eder, and Jagur,
015:022 and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,
015:023 and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

        are twenty-nine, with their villages.
015:033 In the lowland, Eshtaol, and Zorah, and Ashnah,
015:034 and Zanoah, and En Gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,
015:035 Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,
015:036 and Shaaraim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim;
        fourteen cities with their villages.
015:037 Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal Gad,
015:038 and Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,
015:039 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,
015:040 and Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Chitlish,

        sixteen cities with their villages.
015:042 Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,
015:043 and Iphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,
015:044 and Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities
        with their villages.
015:045 Ekron, with its towns and its villages;
015:046 from Ekron even to the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod,
        with their villages.
015:047 Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and
        its villages; to the brook of Egypt, and the great sea,
        and the border [of it].
015:048 In the hill country, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,
015:049 and Dannah, and Kiriath Sannah (the same is Debir),
015:050 and Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,
015:051 and Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.
015:052 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshan,
015:053 and Janim, and Beth Tappuah, and Aphekah,
015:054 and Humtah, and Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), and Zior;
        nine cities with their villages.

015:056 and Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,
015:057 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.
015:058 Halhul, Beth Zur, and Gedor,
015:059 and Maarath, and Beth Anoth, and Eltekon; six cities
        with their villages.
015:060 Kiriath Baal (the same is Kiriath Jearim), and Rabbah;
        two cities with their villages.
015:061 In the wilderness, Beth Arabah, Middin, and Secacah,
015:062 and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En Gedi; six cities
        with their villages.
015:063 As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children
        of Judah couldn't drive them out:  but the Jebusites dwell
        with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
016:001 The lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan
        at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east,
        even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill
        country to Bethel;
016:002 and it went out from Bethel to Luz, and passed along to the border
        of the Archites to Ataroth;
016:003 and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites,
        to the border of Beth Horon the lower, even to Gezer;
        and the goings out of it were at the sea.
016:004 The children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
016:005 The border of the children of Ephraim according to their
        families was [thus]: the border of their inheritance eastward
        was Ataroth Addar, to Beth Horon the upper;
016:006 and the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north;
        and the border turned about eastward to Taanath Shiloh,
        and passed along it on the east of Janoah;
016:007 and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah,
        and reached to Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.
016:008 From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook
        of Kanah; and the goings out of it were at the sea.
        This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim
        according to their families;
016:009 together with the cities which were set apart for the children
        of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children
        of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
016:010 They didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer:
        but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day,
        and are become servants to do forced labor.
017:001 [This] was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was
        the firstborn of Joseph.  As for Machir the firstborn
        of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war,
        therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
017:002 So [the lot] was for the rest of the children of Manasseh
        according to their families:  for the children of Abiezer,
        and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel,
        and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher,
        and for the children of Shemida:  these were the male children
        of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.
017:003 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead,
        the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons,
        but daughters:  and these are the names of his daughters:
        Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
017:004 They came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua
        the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Yahweh commanded
        Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers:
        therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them
        an inheritance among the brothers of their father.
017:005 There fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead
        and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;
017:006 because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons.
        The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
017:007 The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is
        before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand,
        to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.
017:008 The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on
        the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.
017:009 The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook:
        these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh:
        and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook,
        and the goings out of it were at the sea:
017:010 southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's,
        and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north,
        and to Issachar on the east.
017:011 Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth Shean and its towns,
        and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor
        and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns,
        and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants
        of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights.
017:012 Yet the children of Manasseh couldn't drive out [the inhabitants
        of] those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
017:013 It happened, when the children of Israel had grown strong,
        that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn't
        utterly drive them out.
017:014 The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you
        given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I
        am a great people, because hitherto Yahweh has blessed me?
017:015 Joshua said to them, If you are a great people, go up to the forest,
        and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites
        and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephraim is too
        narrow for you.
017:016 The children of Joseph said, The hill country is not enough for us:
        and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have
        chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth Shean and its towns,
        and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.
017:017 Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
        to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people, and have great power;
        you shall not have one lot only:
017:018 but the hill country shall be yours; for though it is a forest,
        you shall cut it down, and the goings out of it shall be yours;
        for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have
        chariots of iron, and though they are strong.
018:001 The whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves
        together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there:
        and the land was subdued before them.
018:002 There remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
        which had not yet divided their inheritance.
018:003 Joshua said to the children of Israel, How long are you slack to go
        in to possess the land, which Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
        has given you?
018:004 Appoint for you three men of each tribe:  and I will send them,
        and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe
        it according to their inheritance; and they shall come to me.
018:005 They shall divide it into seven portions:  Judah shall abide
        in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall
        abide in their border on the north.
018:006 You shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring
        [the description] here to me; and I will cast lots for you
        here before Yahweh our God.
018:007 For the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood
        of Yahweh is their inheritance:  and Gad and Reuben and
        the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance
        beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of
        Yahweh gave them.
018:008 The men arose, and went:  and Joshua charged those who went
        to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land,
        and describe it, and come again to me; and I will cast lots
        for you here before Yahweh in Shiloh.
018:009 The men went and passed through the land, and described it
        by cities into seven portions in a book; and they came
        to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.
018:010 Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh:
        and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel
        according to their divisions.
018:011 The lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
        according to their families:  and the border of their lot went
        out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
018:012 Their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan;
        and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north,
        and went up through the hill country westward; and the goings
        out of it were at the wilderness of Beth Aven.
018:013 The border passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz
        (the same is Bethel), southward; and the border went down
        to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south
        of Beth Horon the lower.
018:014 The border extended [there], and turned about on the west
        quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before
        Beth Horon southward; and the goings out of it were at Kiriath Baal
        (the same is Kiriath Jearim), a city of the children of Judah:
        this was the west quarter.
018:015 The south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kiriath Jearim;
        and the border went out westward, and went out to the spring
        of the waters of Nephtoah;
018:016 and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain
        that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is
        in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to
        the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward,
        and went down to En Rogel;
018:017 and it extended northward, and went out at En Shemesh, and went
        out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim;
        and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;
018:018 and it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward,
        and went down to the Arabah;
018:019 and the border passed along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward;
        and the goings out of the border were at the north
        bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan:
        this was the south border.
018:020 The Jordan was the border of it on the east quarter.
        This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin,
        by the borders of it round about, according to their families.
018:021 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
        according to their families were Jericho, and Beth Hoglah,
        and Emek Keziz,
018:022 and Beth Arabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,
018:023 and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
018:024 and Chephar Ammoni, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities
        with their villages:
018:025 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
018:026 and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,
018:027 and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,
018:028 and Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite (the same is Jerusalem), Gibeath,
        [and] Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages.
        This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according
        to their families.
019:001 The second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe
        of the children of Simeon according to their families:
        and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance
        of the children of Judah.
019:002 They had for their inheritance Beersheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,
019:003 and Hazar Shual, and Balah, and Ezem,
019:004 and Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,
019:005 and Ziklag, and Beth Marcaboth, and Hazar Susah,
019:006 and Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages:
019:007 Ain, Rimmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities with their villages:
019:008 and all the villages that were round about these cities to
        Baalath Beer, Ramah of the South.  This is the inheritance of
        the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.
019:009 Out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance
        of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children
        of Judah was too much for them:  therefore the children
        of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
019:010 The third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according
        to their families; and the border of their inheritance
        was to Sarid;
019:011 and their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached
        to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam;
019:012 and it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to
        the border of Chisloth Tabor; and it went out to Daberath,
        and went up to Japhia;
019:013 and from there it passed along eastward to Gath Hepher, to Ethkazin;
        and it went out at Rimmon which stretches to Neah;
019:014 and the border turned about it on the north to Hannathon;
        and the goings out of it were at the valley of Iphtah El;
019:015 and Kattath, and Nahalal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem:
        twelve cities with their villages.
019:016 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according
        to their families, these cities with their villages.
019:017 The fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for the children
        of Issachar according to their families.
019:018 Their border was to Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,
019:019 and Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath,
019:020 and Rabbith, and Kishion, and Ebez,
019:021 and Remeth, and Engannim, and En Haddah, and Beth Pazzez,
019:022 and the border reached to Tabor, and Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh;
        and the goings out of their border were at the Jordan:
        sixteen cities with their villages.
019:023 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar
        according to their families, the cities with their villages.
019:024 The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher
        according to their families.
019:025 Their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
019:026 and Allammelech, and Amad, and Mishal; and it reached to
        Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;
019:027 and it turned toward the sunrise to Beth Dagon, and reached
        to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah El northward to Beth Emek
        and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left hand,
019:028 and Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Sidon;
019:029 and the border turned to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre;
        and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out of it
        were at the sea by the region of Achzib;
019:030 Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob:  twenty-two cities
        with their villages.
019:031 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.
019:032 The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for
        the children of Naphtali according to their families.
019:033 Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim,
        and Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakkum; and the goings out
        of it were at the Jordan;
019:034 and the border turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, and went out
        from there to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south,
        and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan
        toward the sunrise.
019:035 The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath,
        and Chinnereth,
019:036 and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,
019:037 and Kedesh, and Edrei, and En Hazor,
019:038 Iron, and Migdal El, Horem, and Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh;
        nineteen cities with their villages.
019:039 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali
        according to their families, the cities with their villages.
019:040 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan
        according to their families.
019:041 The border of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,
019:042 and Shaalabbin, and Aijalon, and Ithlah,
019:043 and Elon, and Timnah, and Ekron,
019:044 and Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,
019:045 and Jehud, and Bene Berak, and Gath Rimmon,
019:046 and Me Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa.
019:047 The border of the children of Dan went out beyond them;
        for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem,
        and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,
        and possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan,
        after the name of Dan their father.
019:048 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.
019:049 So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance
        by the borders of it; and the children of Israel gave an
        inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:
019:050 according to the commandment of Yahweh they gave him the city
        which he asked, even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim;
        and he built the city, and lived therein.
019:051 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
        the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the tribes
        of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot
        in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of the tent of meeting.
        So they made an end of dividing the land.
020:001 Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
020:002 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities
        of refuge, of which I spoke to you by Moses,
020:003 that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly [and]
        unawares may flee there:  and they shall be to you for a refuge
        from the avenger of blood.
020:004 He shall flee to one of those cities, and shall stand at
        the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause
        in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall
        take him into the city to them, and give him a place,
        that he may dwell among them.
020:005 If the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall
        not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he struck
        his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him before.
020:006 He shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
        congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest
        that shall be in those days:  then shall the manslayer return,
        and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city
        from whence he fled.
020:007 They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali,
        and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba
        (the same is Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
020:008 Beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer
        in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben,
        and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan
        in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
020:009 These were the appointed cities for all the children
        of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them,
        that whoever kills any person unwittingly might flee there,
        and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood
        before the congregation.
021:001 Then came near the heads of fathers' [houses] of the Levites
        to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun,
        and to the heads of fathers' [houses] of the tribes of
        the children of Israel;
021:002 and they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan,
        saying, Yahweh commanded Moses to give us cities to dwell in,
        with the suburbs of it for our livestock.
021:003 The children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance,
        according to the commandment of Yahweh, these cities
        with their suburbs.
021:004 The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites:
        and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites,
        had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of
        the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
021:005 The rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families
        of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan,
        and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
021:006 The children of Gershon had by lot out of the families
        of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher,
        and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe
        of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
021:007 The children of Merari according to their families had
        out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad,
        and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
021:008 The children of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities
        with their suburbs, as Yahweh commanded by Moses.
021:009 They gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah,
        and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities
        which are [here] mentioned by name:
021:010 and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families
        of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi;
        for theirs was the first lot.
021:011 They gave them Kiriath Arba, [which Arba was] the father of Anak
        (the same is Hebron), in the hill country of Judah,
        with the suburbs of it round about it.
021:012 But the fields of the city, and the villages of it, gave they
        to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
021:013 To the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron
        with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer,
        and Libnah with its suburbs,
021:014 and Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs,
021:015 and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,
021:016 and Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs,
        [and] Beth Shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of
        those two tribes.
021:017 Out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs,
        Geba with its suburbs,
021:018 Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.
021:019 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests,
        were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
021:020 The families of the children of Kohath, the Levites,
        even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities
        of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
021:021 They gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill country
        of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer
        with its suburbs,
021:022 and Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth Horon with its suburbs;
        four cities.
021:023 Out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its suburbs,
        Gibbethon with its suburbs,
021:024 Aijalon with its suburbs, Gath Rimmon with its suburbs; four cities.
021:025 Out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs,
        and Gath Rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.
021:026 All the cities of the families of the rest of the children
        of Kohath were ten with their suburbs.
021:027 To the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites,
        out of the half-tribe of Manasseh [they gave] Golan in Bashan
        with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer,
        and Be Eshterah with its suburbs; two cities.
021:028 Out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its suburbs,
        Daberath with its suburbs,
021:029 Jarmuth with its suburbs, En Gannim with its suburbs; four cities.
021:030 Out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs,
        Abdon with its suburbs,
021:031 Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities.
021:032 Out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs,
        the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammothdor with
        its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.
021:033 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families
        were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
021:034 To the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites,
        out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs,
        and Kartah with its suburbs,
021:035 Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities.
021:036 Out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahaz
        with its suburbs,
021:037 Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs;
        four cities.
021:038 Out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs,
        the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with its suburbs,
021:039 Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs;
        four cities in all.
021:040 All [these were] the cities of the children of Merari according
        to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites;
        and their lot was twelve cities.
021:041 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession
        of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities
        with their suburbs.
021:042 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them:
        thus it was with all these cities.
021:043 So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give
        to their fathers; and they possessed it, and lived therein.
021:044 Yahweh gave them rest round about, according to all that he swore
        to their fathers:  and there stood not a man of all their
        enemies before them; Yahweh delivered all their enemies
        into their hand.
021:045 There failed not anything of any good thing which Yahweh had
        spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.
022:001 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
        and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
022:002 and said to them, You have kept all that Moses the servant
        of Yahweh commanded you, and have listened to my voice in all
        that I commanded you:
022:003 you have not left your brothers these many days to this day,
        but have kept the charge of the commandment of Yahweh your God.
022:004 Now Yahweh your God has given rest to your brothers, as he spoke
        to them:  therefore now turn you, and get you to your tents,
        to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant
        of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan.
022:005 Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses
        the servant of Yahweh commanded you, to love Yahweh your God,
        and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments,
        and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all your heart
        and with all your soul.
022:006 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went
        to their tents.
022:007 Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
        [inheritance] in Bashan; but to the other half gave
        Joshua among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward;
        moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents,
        he blessed them,
022:008 and spoke to them, saying, Return with much wealth to your tents,
        and with very much livestock, with silver, and with gold,
        and with brass, and with iron, and with very much clothing:
        divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.
022:009 The children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe
        of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel
        out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land
        of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they owned,
        according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
022:010 When they came to the region about the Jordan, that is in the land
        of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and
        the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan,
        a great altar to look on.
022:011 The children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben
        and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh
        have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan,
        in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertains
        to the children of Israel.
022:012 When the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation
        of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh,
        to go up against them to war.
022:013 The children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben,
        and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh,
        into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
022:014 and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for
        each of the tribes of Israel; and they were everyone of them
        head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Israel.
022:015 They came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad,
        and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead,
        and they spoke with them, saying,
022:016 Thus says the whole congregation of Yahweh, What trespass
        is this that you have committed against the God of Israel,
        to turn away this day from following Yahweh, in that you
        have built you an altar, to rebel this day against Yahweh?
022:017 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we
        have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came
        a plague on the congregation of Yahweh,
022:018 that you must turn away this day from following Yahweh? and it
        will be, seeing you rebel today against Yahweh, that tomorrow
        he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
022:019 However, if the land of your possession be unclean,
        then pass over to the land of the possession of Yahweh,
        in which Yahweh's tent dwells, and take possession among us:
        but don't rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us,
        in building you an altar besides the altar of Yahweh our God.
022:020 Didn't Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing,
        and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man
        didn't perish alone in his iniquity.
022:021 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and
        the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads
        of the thousands of Israel,
022:022 The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows;
        and Israel he shall know:  if it be in rebellion, or if in
        trespass against Yahweh (don't save us this day),
022:023 that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh;
        or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meal offering,
        or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings thereon,
        let Yahweh himself require it;
022:024 and if we have not [rather] out of carefulness done this,
        [and] of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might
        speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with Yahweh,
        the God of Israel?
022:025 for Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you,
        you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no portion
        in Yahweh:  so might your children make our children cease
        from fearing Yahweh.
022:026 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar,
        not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
022:027 but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our
        generations after us, that we may do the service of Yahweh
        before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices,
        and with our peace offerings; that your children may not tell
        our children in time to come, You have no portion in Yahweh.
022:028 Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so tell us
        or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say,
        Behold the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our
        fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice;
        but it is a witness between us and you.
022:029 Far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh,
        and turn away this day from following Yahweh, to build an altar
        for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice,
        besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tent.
022:030 When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation,
        even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him,
        heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children
        of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well.
022:031 Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children
        of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children
        of Manasseh, This day we know that Yahweh is in the midst of us,
        because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh:
        now have you delivered the children of Israel out of the
        hand of Yahweh.
022:032 Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
        returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children
        of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan,
        to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
022:033 The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of
        Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them
        to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben
        and the children of Gad lived.
022:034 The children of Reuben and the children of Gad called
        the altar [Ed]: For, [said they], it is a witness between us
        that Yahweh is God.
023:001 It happened after many days, when Yahweh had given rest
        to Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua
        was old and well stricken in years;
023:002 that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for
        their heads, and for their judges and for their officers,
        and said to them, I am old and well stricken in years:
023:003 and you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all
        these nations because of you; for Yahweh your God, he it
        is that has fought for you.
023:004 Behold, I have allotted to you these nations that remain,
        to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan,
        with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great
        sea toward the going down of the sun.
023:005 Yahweh your God, he will thrust them out from before you,
        and drive them from out of your sight; and you shall possess
        their land, as Yahweh your God spoke to you.
023:006 Therefore be you very courageous to keep and to do all that is
        written in the book of the law of Moses, that you not turn
        aside from it to the right hand or to the left;
023:007 that you not come among these nations, these that remain
        among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods,
        nor cause to swear [by them], neither serve them, nor bow
        down yourselves to them;
023:008 but cleave to Yahweh your God, as you have done to this day.
023:009 For Yahweh has driven out from before you great nations and strong:
        but as for you, no man has stood before you to this day.
023:010 One man of you shall chase a thousand; for Yahweh your God,
        he it is who fights for you, as he spoke to you.
023:011 Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that you love
        Yahweh your God.
023:012 Else if you do at all go back, and cleave to the remnant
        of these nations, even these who remain among you, and make
        marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you;
023:013 know for a certainty that Yahweh your God will no more drive
        these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be
        a snare and a trap to you, and a scourge in your sides,
        and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this
        good land which Yahweh your God has given you.
023:014 Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth:
        and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls,
        that not one thing has failed of all the good things which
        Yahweh your God spoke concerning you; all are happen to you,
        not one thing has failed of it.
023:015 It shall happen, that as all the good things are come on you
        of which Yahweh your God spoke to you, so will Yahweh bring
        on you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from
        off this good land which Yahweh your God has given you.
023:016 When you disobey the covenant of Yahweh your God,
        which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods,
        and bow down yourselves to them; then will the anger of Yahweh
        be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off
        the good land which he has given to you.
024:001 Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem,
        and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads,
        and for their judges, and for their officers; and they
        presented themselves before God.
024:002 Joshua said to all the people, Thus says Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, Your fathers lived of old time beyond the River,
        even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor:
        and they served other gods.
024:003 I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him
        throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed,
        and gave him Isaac.
024:004 I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau:  and I gave to Esau Mount Seir,
        to possess it:  and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
024:005 I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
        that which I did in the midst of it:  and afterward I
        brought you out.
024:006 I brought your fathers out of Egypt:  and you came to the sea;
        and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots
        and with horsemen to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
024:007 When they cried out to Yahweh, he put darkness between
        you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them,
        and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt:
        and you lived in the wilderness many days.
024:008 I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond
        the Jordan:  and they fought with you; and I gave them into
        your hand, and you possessed their land; and I destroyed them
        from before you.
024:009 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought
        against Israel:  and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor
        to curse you;
024:010 but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still:
        so I delivered you out of his hand.
024:011 You went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho:  and the men
        of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite,
        and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite,
        and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.
024:012 I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you,
        even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword,
        nor with your bow.
024:013 I gave you a land whereon you had not labored, and cities
        which you didn't build, and you dwell therein; of vineyards
        and olive groves which you didn't plant do you eat.
024:014 Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve him in sincerity and in truth;
        and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River,
        and in Egypt; and serve you Yahweh.
024:015 If it seem evil to you to serve Yahweh, choose you this day whom
        you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served
        that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites,
        in whose land you dwell:  but as for me and my house,
        we will serve Yahweh.
024:016 The people answered, Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh,
        to serve other gods;
024:017 for Yahweh our God, he it is who brought us and our fathers
        up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
        and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us
        in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples
        through the midst of whom we passed;
024:018 and Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites
        who lived in the land:  therefore we also will serve Yahweh;
        for he is our God.
024:019 Joshua said to the people, You can't serve Yahweh;
        for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive
        your disobedience nor your sins.
024:020 If you forsake Yahweh, and serve foreign gods, then he will
        turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that he has
        done you good.
024:021 The people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve Yahweh.
024:022 Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against
        yourselves that you have chosen you Yahweh, to serve him.
        They said, We are witnesses.
024:023 Now therefore put away, [said he], the foreign gods which are
        among you, and incline your heart to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
024:024 The people said to Joshua, Yahweh our God will we serve,
        and to his voice will we listen.
024:025 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
        them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
024:026 Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God;
        and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak
        that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.
024:027 Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be
        a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of Yahweh
        which he spoke to us:  it shall be therefore a witness against you,
        lest you deny your God.
024:028 So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
024:029 It happened after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun,
        the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.
024:030 They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah,
        which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north
        of the mountain of Gaash.
024:031 Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days
        of the elders who outlived Joshua, and had known all the work
        of Yahweh, that he had worked for Israel.
024:032 The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
        up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel
        of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor
        the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money:
        and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
024:033 Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill
        of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill
        country of Ephraim.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05

Or /etext04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92,
91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

ways.

(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the

or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by

          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent

     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
