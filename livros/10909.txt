PREFACE

The importance of Hartzenbusch in the history of the Spanish drama and
the enduring popularity in Spain of _Los Amantes de Teruel_, his
masterpiece, have assured this play a definite place in the work of
advanced students of Spanish literature in our universities. For such
students the many editions published in Spain and elsewhere have been
perhaps sufficient, but for the much larger number who never reach the
advanced literary classes an annotated edition is needed. That this play
offers excellent material for the work of more elementary courses in the
schools and colleges has long been the opinion of the present editor;
and that it has not already found a place among the Spanish texts
published in this country is difficult to understand. The old legend of
Teruel, the embodiment of pure and constant love, is one that might well
be expected to make a strong appeal to the youth of any country; the
simple and direct presentation given to the legend by Hartzenbusch and
the comparative freedom from textual difficulties, as the result of the
careful revisions of the play by its scholarly author, bring it within
the range of the understanding and appreciation of students who have
studied Spanish one year in college or two years in high school, if it
is put before them in a properly prepared edition.

The editor has kept in mind this class of students in the preparation of
the Introduction, Notes, and Vocabulary. To those who consider the
Introduction disproportionately long, the excuse is given that this will
be the first Romantic play read by many students, and that if they are
to understand it and appreciate its fine literary qualities, they must
be enabled to view it in its proper historical perspective. It is to be
hoped that this edition may serve as a safe approach to the systematic
study, of the Romantic Movement in Spanish literature.

The text of the play is that of the annotated edition of Dr. Adolf
Kressner, Leipsic, 1887 (_Bibliothek Spanischer Schriftsteller_), and is
the same as the one contained in the definitive collection of the plays
of Hartzenbusch, _Teatro_, Madrid, 1888-1892, Vol. I, pages 7-130
(_Colecci�n de Escritores Castellanos_).

The indebtedness of the editor to Professor E.C. Hills of Indiana
University for many helpful suggestions is gratefully acknowledged.

INTRODUCTION


#I. The Legend#. Constancy in love has inspired many writers and has
given undying fame to many legends and traditions. Among the famous
lovers that have passed into legend and that stand as the embodiment of
constant love in different ages and in different countries,--Pyramus and
Thisbe, Hero and Leander, Tristam and Isolde, Romeo and Juliet,--are to
be found Marsilla and Isabel. These _Lovers of Teruel_, as constant as
any of the others, are especially notable because of the purity of their
love and because of the absence of violence in their sudden departure
from this life. Disappointed love, desperate grief at separation, was
the only cause of their death.

The old city of Teruel, founded by the Aragonese in the latter half of
the twelfth century at the junction of the Guadalaviar and the Alfambra
as a stronghold in the territory recently recovered from the Moors, was
the fitting scene for the action of the legend.... The pioneer life of
the city, the depth of sentiment and singleness of purpose of its
Aragonese inhabitants, the crusading spirit that carried to victory the
armies of Peter II of Arag�n and his more famous son, James the
Conqueror, lend probability to a legend that would ordinarily be
considered highly improbable from the point of view of historical
authenticity. Stripped of the fantastic details that have gathered about
it in the many literary treatments given to it by Spanish writers, the
legend may be briefly told. In Teruel, at the beginning of the
thirteenth century, lived Juan Diego Mart�nez Garc�s de Marsilla and
Isabel de Segura. They had loved each other from childhood, but when it
became a question of marriage, Isabel's father opposed the union
because of the young man's lack of material resources and because a
wealthy suitor, Rodrigo de Azagra, had presented himself for the hand of
his daughter. All that the entreaties of the lovers could gain from him
was the promise that if Marsilla went to the wars, gained fame and
riches, and returned before a certain day, he would receive Isabel in
marriage. This Marsilla did; but unfortunately he was unable to return
until just after the expiration of the time set. When he reached Teruel,
he found Isabel married to the wealthy rival. Disappointed in their
hopes after so many years of constant love and continual struggle
against adversity, Marsilla died of grief, and Isabel soon followed him;
separated in life by cruel fate, they were united in death. Buried in
the same tomb, they were later disinterred, and their mummified remains
may now be seen in the old church of San Pedro in Teruel.

#II. Authenticity of the Legend#. The earliest references that have
yet been found to the legend belong to the middle of the sixteenth
century, that is, more than three centuries after the supposed death of
the lovers. In 1555, when the church of San Pedro in Teruel was
undergoing some repairs, two bodies, supposedly those of Marsilla and
Isabel, were discovered in one tomb in a remarkably good state of
preservation. They were reburied at the foot of the altar in the chapel
of Saints Cosme and Damian, and the story of the unfortunate lovers
began to spread far and wide. By the end of the century it was
apparently widely known and attracted considerable attention to the old
city of Teruel. When Philip III of Spain was journeying to Valencia in
1599 he was induced to turn aside to visit the church of San Pedro. In
the official account of his journey, "Jornada de Su Majestad Felipe III
y Alteza la Infanta Do�a Isabel, desde Madrid, a casarse el Rey con la
Reyna Do�a Margarita, y su Alteza con el Archiduque Alberto," the story
of the legend as then generally accepted is related so succinctly that
it may well be quoted here: "En la iglesia de San Pedro, en la capilla
de San Cosme y San Dami�n, de la dicha ciudad, est� la sepultura de los
Amantes que llaman de Teruel; y dicen eran un mancebo y una doncella que
se quer�an mucho, ella rica y �l al contrario; y como �l pidiese por
mujer la doncella y por ser pobre no se la diesen, se determin� a ir por
el mundo a adquerir hacienda y ella aguardarle ciertos a�os, al cabo de
los cuales y dos o tres d�as m�s, volvi� rico y hall� que aquella noche
se casaba la doncella. Tuvo trazas de meterse debajo de su cama y a
media noche le pidi� un abrazo, d�ndose a conocer; ella le dijo que no
pod�a por no ser ya suya, y �l muri� luego al punto. Llev�ronle a
enterrar, y ella fu� al entierro, y cuando le quer�an echar en la
sepultura, se arrim� a la ata�d y qued� all� muerta; y as� los
enterraron juntos en una sepultura, sabido el caso."

Seventeen years later a long epic poem by the secretary of the city
council of Teruel, Juan Yag�e de Salas, aroused much discussion as to
the authenticity of the legend. In 1619 the bodies were again exhumed
and in the coffin of one of them were found written the words "�ste es
Don Diego Juan Mart�nez de Marsilla"; also a document, "papel de letra
muy antigua," giving the story in detail. This document disappeared, but
the copy that Juan Yag�e claimed to have made may be seen in the
archives of the church of San Pedro or in the transcription published in
the _Semanario Pintoresco_ for the week ending Feb. 5, 1837 (Vol. II,
pages 45-47). The genuineness of the document and its copy is very
doubtful. The first paragraph shows some linguistic peculiarities of old
Aragonese; but these gradually disappear, until there is little left in
the language to differentiate it from that of the good notary public and
poet, Juan Yag�e, who was so anxious to prove authenticity for the
legend treated in his poem. Although there is no reliable evidence that
the bodies exhumed in 1555 and again in 1619 were those of Marsilla and
Isabel, the church of San Pedro has held them in special reverence.
They attract many admirers to the old city on the Guadalaviar and the
tourist who expresses incredulity when shown the remains of the lovers
becomes thereby _persona non grata_ in Teruel.

For three centuries the controversy has continued and has resulted in
the spilling of much ink. The most complete and authoritative study of
the sources and growth of the legend is that of the eminent scholar
Cotarelo y Mori _(Sobre el origen y desarrollo de la leyenda de Los
Amantes de Teruel_, 2d edition, 1907). His conclusions support the
theory that the legend is the result of the localization in Teruel of
the story of the unfortunate Florentine lovers, Girolamo and Salvestra,
as related by Boccaccio in his _Decameron_, Book IV, Novel 8. He refutes
the arguments advanced by the supporters of the authenticity of the
legend, calls attention to the suspicious nature of all the documents,
and maintains the thesis that Boccaccio's story found its way into Spain
toward the end of the fourteenth century and took the form of the legend
of the _Lovers of Teruel_ about the middle of the sixteenth century, at
which time it first appeared definitely in Spanish literature. The
majority of literary critics and historians accept Cotarelo y Mori's
conclusions; others, however, refuse to give up the historic basis of
the legend. They cannot deny, of course, the evident similarity of the
stories; they explain it by saying that the story of the constant lovers
who died in Teruel in 1217 was carried to Italy by Aragonese soldiers or
merchants, was heard by the Italian novelist, and used by him as the
basis for his story of Girolamo and Salvestra.

#III. The Legend in Spanish Literature.# Very few of the famous
legends of the world rest upon documentary evidence, and the fact that
the legend of the _Lovers of Teruel_ lacks historic proof has had little
influence upon its popularity. It has been productive of much
literature, the extent of which is indicated by the two hundred or more
titles contained in the bibliography[l] published by Domingo Gasc�n y
Guimbao in 1907. Of the many poems, plays, and novels inspired by the
legend only the most noteworthy can be mentioned here. The oldest
literary treatment is apparently that of Pedro de Alventosa, written
about the middle of the sixteenth century, _Historia lastimosa y sentida
de los tiernos amantes Marcilla y Segura_. This was followed in 1566 by
a Latin poem of about five hundred lines by Antonio de Ser�n, published
in 1907 by Gasc�n y Guimbao, with a Spanish translation and an excellent
bibliography. In 1581 the legend was given dramatic treatment by Rey de
Artieda, who followed the story in its essential elements but modernized
the action by placing it in the time of Charles V, only forty-six years
earlier than the publication of the play. It has little literary value,
but is important because of its influence on later dramatists. Passing
over various treatments of the theme that serve merely to indicate its
growing popularity, we come to the pretentious epic poem of Juan Yag�e
de Salas in twenty-six cantos, _Los Amantes de Teruel, Epopeya tr�gica_,
in which, besides adding many fantastic details to the legend, the
author presented much extraneous matter bearing upon the general history
of Teruel. Because of this widely known poem and the growing popularity
of the _Lovers_, two dramatists of the Golden Age, Tirso de Molina and
P�rez de Montalb�n, gave it their attention. _Los Amantes de Teruel_ of
the great Tirso de Molina, published in 1635, is disappointing,
considering the dramatic ability of the author; it contains passages of
dramatic effectiveness but is weak in construction. As in Rey de
Artieda's play, the action is placed in the sixteenth century; Marsilla
takes part in the famous expedition of Charles V against the Moors in
Tunis, saves the Emperor's life, and, richly rewarded, returns, too
late, to claim the promised bride. It is a better play than that of
Artieda, but is itself surpassed by Montalb�n's play of three years
later. Although he was far from possessing the dramatic genius of Tirso,
Montalb�n succeeded in giving the story the form that it was to maintain
on the stage for two centuries. Frequent performances and many editions
of his play, as well as many other literary treatments and references
that might be cited, attest the continued popularity of the legend.

Finally, in the early days of Romanticism, it assumed the dramatic form
that has remained most popular down to the present day. On the
nineteenth of January of the year 1837 the theatergoing people of Madrid
were moved to vociferous applause by a new treatment of the old theme,
and a new star of the literary firmament was recognized in the person of
Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch. In his dramatic masterpiece Hartzenbusch
eclipsed all the other plays that have dealt with the legend, and more
than twenty editions stand as proof of its continued popularity. Besides
these many editions of the play, numerous novels, poems, and operas have
appeared from time to time. For the most complete bibliography down to
1907 the reader is again referred to that of the official historian of
Teruel, Gasc�n y Guimbao. We must now turn our attention to the author
of the best dramatic treatment of the legend.

#IV. Life of Hartzenbusch#. Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch, born in 1806,
was the only son of a German cabinet-maker who had wandered to Spain
from his home near Cologne, married a Spanish girl, and opened up a shop
in Madrid. The son inherited from his German father and Spanish mother
traits of character that were exemplified later in his life and
writings. From his father he received a fondness for meditation,
conscientious industry in acquiring sound scholarship, and the patience
needed for the continual revision of his plays; from his mother came his
ardent imagination and love of literature. Childhood and youth were for
him a period of disappointment and struggle against adversity. Less than
two years old when his mother died after a short period of insanity
caused by the sight of bloodshed in the turbulent streets of Madrid in
1808, he was left to the care of a brooding father who had little
sympathy with his literary aspirations, but who did wish to give him the
best education he could afford. He received a common school education
and was permitted to spend the four years from 1818 to 1822 in the
College of San Isidro. As a result of the political troubles in Spain in
1823, the father's business, never very prosperous, fell away and the
son had to leave college to help in the workshop. He was thus compelled
to spend a large part of his time in making furniture, although his
inclination was toward literature.

His leisure was given to study and to the acquirement of a practical
knowledge of the dramatic art, gained for the most part from books,
because of his father's dislike of the theater and because of the lack
of money for any unnecessary expenditure. He translated several French
and Italian plays, adapted others to Spanish conditions, and recast
various _comedias_ of the _Siglo de Oro_, with a view to making them
more suitable for presentation. He tried his hand also at original
production and succeeded in getting some of his plays on the stage, only
to have them withdrawn almost immediately. Undiscouraged by repeated
failure, he continued studying and writing, more determined than ever to
become a successful dramatist and thus realize the ambition that was
kindled in him by the first dramatic performance that he had witnessed
when he had already reached manhood.

At the time of his marriage in 1830 he was still helping his ailing and
despondent father in the workshop; more interested undoubtedly in his
literary pursuits, but ever faithful to the call of duty. Until success
as a dramatist made it possible for him to gain a living for his family
by literature, he continued patiently his manual labor. At his father's
death he closed the workshop and for a short time became dependent for
a livelihood on stenography, with which he had already eked out the
slender returns from the labor of his hands.

Meanwhile, during these last years of apprenticeship in which
Hartzenbusch was gaining complete mastery of his art by continual study
and practice, the literary revolution known as Romanticism was making
rapid progress. The death of the despotic Ferdinand VII in 1833 removed
the restraint that had been imposed upon literature as well as upon
political ideas. The theories of the French and English Romanticists
were penetrating Spanish literary circles, to be taken up eagerly by the
younger dramatists; political exiles of high social and literary
prestige, such as Mart�nez de la Rosa and the Duque de Rivas, were
returning to Spain with plays and poems composed according to the new
theories; the natural reaction from the logical, unemotional ideals of
the Classicists was developing conditions favorable to the revolution.
The first year of the struggle between the two schools of literature,
1834, gave the Romanticists two important victories in the _Conjuraci�n
de Venecia_ of Martinez de la Rosa, and the _Mac�as_ of Jos� de Larra,
two plays that show clearly Romantic tendencies but that avoid an abrupt
break with the Classical theories. They served to prepare the way for
the thoroughly Romantic play of the Duque de Rivas, _Don �lvaro o la
fuerza del sino_, a magnificent, though disordered, drama that gained
for the Romanticists a decisive victory in 1835, a victory over
Classicism in Spain similar to that gained in Paris five years earlier
by the famous _Hernani_ of Victor Hugo, leader of the French
Romanticists. In 1836 the equally successful performance of _El
Trovador_, the Romantic play of Garc�a Guti�rrez, confirmed the victory
gained by the Romanticists with _Don �lvaro_, and gave clear indication
that the literary revolution was complete. The temper of the time was
decidedly Romantic, and the wholehearted applause that resounded through
the Teatro del Pr�ncipe on the night of Jan. 19, 1837, at the first
performance of _Los Amantes de Teruel_ put an end to the long and
laborious apprenticeship of Hartzenbusch.

A few days later the warm reception given the play and its continued
popularity were justified in a remarkable piece of dramatic criticism by
the rival playwright and keen literary critic, Jos� de Larra, known
better by his journalistic pen-name, F�garo, and greatly feared by his
contemporaries for his mordant criticism and stinging satire. In the
opening words of his review of the play, we may see the highly favorable
attitude of the critic and realize the suddenness of the fame that came
to Hartzenbusch. "Venir a aumentar el n�mero de los vivientes, ser un
hombre m�s donde hay tantos hombres, o�r decir de s�: 'Es un tal
fulano,' es ser un �rbol m�s en una alameda. Pero pasar cinco o seis
lustros oscuro y desconocido, y llegar una noche entre otras, convocar a
un pueblo, hacer tributaria su curiosidad, alzar una cortina, conmover
el coraz�n, subyugar el juicio, hacerse aplaudir y aclamar, y o�r al d�a
siguiente de s� mismo al pasar por una calle o por el Prado: 'Aqu�l es
el escritor de la comedia aplaudida,' eso es algo; es nacer; es devolver
al autor de nuestros d�as por un apellido oscuro un nombre claro; es dar
alcurnia a sus ascendientes en vez de recibirla de ellos."[2] Other
contemporary reviews were just as favorable, and all expressed with
F�garo great hopes in the career of a dramatist that had thus begun with
an acknowledged masterpiece. The _Semanario Pintoresco_, for example, a
literary magazine in its second year of publication, ended its review of
the play with these words: "El joven que, saliendo de la oscuridad del
taller de un artesano, se presenta en el mundo literario con los Amantes
de Teruel por primera prueba de su talento, hace concebir al teatro
espa�ol la fundada esperanza de futuros d�as de gloria, y de verse
elevado a la altura que un d�a ocup� en la admiraci�n del mundo
civilizado." (Feb. 5, 1837.)

[Footnote 2: _Obras completas de F�garo._ Paris, 1889. Vol. III, page
187.]

Thus encouraged by popular applause and by the enthusiastic praise of
literary critics, Hartzenbusch produced at varying intervals many
excellent plays, but none of them surpassed or even equaled his _Amantes
de Teruel_. Many of them, characterized by careful workmanship, dramatic
effectiveness, and fine literary finish, are well worth studying, and
deserve more attention than can be given them here. They offer all kinds
of drama: tragedies such as _Do�a Menc�a_, in which the exaggerations of
Romanticism are given free rein; historical plays, in which striking
incidents in Spanish history or legend are given dramatic treatment;
fantastic plays, such as _La redoma encantada_, in which magic plays an
important part; comedies of character and manners, such as _La coja y el
encogido_, in which contemporary life found humorous presentation. The
best of them may be read in the three volumes published in the
well-known series _Colecci�n de Escritores Castellanos_. For literary
criticism the student is referred to the books mentioned later in the
bibliography.

The love of study grew stronger in Hartzenbusch as the opportunity to
devote himself to it became greater, so that after he had had several
plays presented with considerable success, scholarship began to absorb
more and more of his time and the intervals between plays began to
lengthen. Literary criticism, editorial work in connection with new
editions of the Spanish classics, his duties as assistant and, later,
chief librarian of the Biblioteca Nacional, these, with the production
from time to time of a new play, made him a well-known figure in the
literary life of Madrid. His was the quiet life of the modern man of
letters, to whom the incidents of greatest interest are of the
intellectual order: the production of a new play, the publication of a
new book of literary or scholarly value, the discovery of an old
manuscript or the announcement of a new theory, the admission of a new
member to the Spanish Academy. Serenely tolerant in his outlook upon
life, of gentle disposition and ready sympathy, unaffectedly modest,
indifferent to the accumulation of property beyond the needs of his
simple mode of living, conscientious in the performance of all his
duties, he retained to the end of his life the personal esteem of his
many friends. When death put an end in 1880 to the long illness that
saddened the last years of his life, his mortal remains were conducted
to the tomb with all due ceremony by the Spanish Academy, to which
membership had been granted him in 1847 as a recognition of his
excellent work as dramatist and scholar.

The productivity of Hartzenbusch, as well as his versatility, would be
remarkable in any country but Spain. The _Bibliograf�a de Hartzenbusch_,
prepared by his son and published in 1900,[3] stands as proof of the
great extent and diversity of his productions; four hundred pages are
needed for the bibliographical data connected with his many publications
and for a few extracts from his unpublished writings. Hundreds of titles
of dramas, poems, addresses, essays, literary criticism, scholarly
commentaries, indicate the versatility of his talent and his tireless
industry.

#V. Hartzenbusch's Treatment of the Legend.# Apparently Hartzenbusch
had given much study and thought to the famous legend of the _Lovers of
Teruel_. At first it was his intention to use it in an historical novel,
but only the first few pages of this have been preserved (_Bibliograf�a
de Hartzenbusch_). Believing that the legend could be better treated in
dramatic form, he applied himself enthusiastically to the construction
of the play in accordance with the new theories that were becoming
popular, and had it ready for production when a copy of Jos� de Larra's
_Mac�as_ came into his hands. What was his astonishment to find that the
plot of his play was so similar to that of _Mac�as_ that no one would be
likely to accept the similarity as a mere coincidence. Patiently he
reconstructed it and had it published in 1836, if the date on the title
page of the oldest edition is to be accepted as accurate.[4] If
published in 1836, the author remained in obscurity until the first
performance of the play, January 19 of the following year, made him
famous.

[Footnote 4: _Los Amantes de Teruel_, drama en cinco actos en prosa y
verso por Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch. Madrid. Imprenta de D. Jos� Mar�a
Repull�s. 1836.]

Many difficulties beset the dramatist in the construction of the play.
The legend that served as plot was already known to all, so that the
element of suspense could not be used to any great extent. Moreover, the
climax was not in itself dramatic; the death of two lovers through grief
at separation, pathetic though it be, lacked the tragic element of other
similar stories in which death resulted from violence. The _d�nouement_,
the probability of which would not be generally accepted, had to be
retained in the treatment of a legend so widely known, a legend in which
the essential originality consisted in this very improbability. Careful
preparation throughout the whole play was needed, then, for this
improbable _d�nouement_, pathetic, rather than tragic; dramatic
incidents had to be supplied by the author's own inventiveness, the
characters had to be carefully delineated, the motivation carefully
considered. How successfully the author was able to overcome these
difficulties, with what dramatic skill he was able to succeed where
dramatists such as Tirso de Molina and Montalb�n were only partially
successful, careful study of the play will reveal.

The play as given in this edition differs in many ways from the play as
first presented in 1837. More than once the author returned to it, and
the numerous editions needed to supply the popular and continuous demand
gave him the opportunity to revise it and give it the most artistic
finish of which he was capable. Changed literary conditions after
Romanticism had run its course are reflected in the more sober dress of
the revised play; there are reflected in it, too, the greater
restraint, the more scholarly and critical attention to character
delineation and literary finish befitting a man who had passed from the
warm impulsiveness of youth to the calm rationality of middle age. The
student who takes the trouble to compare the text of this edition with
that of the first will see many changes: the five acts are reduced to
four; some of the prose scenes are now in poetic form; the diction is
much improved generally and obscure passages are made clear; some
changes in motivation are to be noted, especially in the scenes leading
up to the voluntary marriage of Isabel with Azagra; the mother's
character is notably ennobled. On the whole, the play has gained by
these revisions; what it has lost in freshness and spontaneity has been
more than counterbalanced by the more careful delineation of character,
improved motivation of action, correctness of diction, and literary
finish. The play in its first form is undoubtedly a better example of
Romanticism in all its phases, its tendencies toward exaggeration, its
crudities of thought and expression, combined with qualities unsurpassed
in any other period of literature; in its revised form it is a more
artistic production, is still a Romantic play, and one of the best in
Spanish literature.

#VI. Romanticism.# Generally speaking, an author belongs to his own
age and country, is moved by the prevalent ideas and sentiments; his
outlook upon life is similar to that of the majority of his
contemporaries. Ordinarily then, a piece of literature of a past age is
understood and fully appreciated only by the student who is able to view
it in its proper historical perspective, to see it through the eyes of
those for whom it was written. Especially is this true of Romantic
literature, the production of ardent and youthful enthusiasts who found
themselves suddenly emancipated from the rigid rules and formalism of
French pseudo-Classicism of the eighteenth century. The tendency in
literature, as in political and social life, is to pass in a pendulum
swing from one extreme to the other, so that to appreciate the fine and
enduring qualities of Romantic literature and to make due allowance for
its exaggerations and other apparent faults, the student must know
something of the Romantic movement and of the Classicism that
immediately preceded it. Moreover, his purpose in reading a literary
masterpiece is not merely to understand and appreciate it in itself, but
also to gain through it some understanding of the age or literary
movement of which it is a representative. In order, then, that _Los
Amantes de Teruel_ may be more fully appreciated as a dramatic
masterpiece, and in order that through it the student may come to a
fuller understanding of Romanticism, his attention is now directed to
the essential characteristics of this important literary movement.

Romanticism in Spanish literature is the name given to the literary
revolt that began about 1830 against pseudo-Classicism. A similar revolt
had already freed the other literatures of Europe, so that the many
Spanish exiles who had been forced to seek refuge for political reasons
in England or on the Continent there became familiar with the new ideas
in literature. Ardent converts to the new literary ideals, these
political exiles, when permitted to return to Spain at the death of the
despotic Ferdinand VII in 1833, became the leaders in a literary
revolution that soon swept away all opposition. The logical reaction
from the rigid rules and formalism, new ideas in political and social
life weakened opposition so rapidly and effectively that the Romantic
poetry and plays of the Duque de Rivas, Espronceda, Garc�a Guti�rrez,
Hartzenbusch, and others found a ready and enthusiastic welcome.

In the comparison that is to be made of Romanticism and Classicism,
_romantic_ and _classic_ are to be used in their technical, literary
sense. As ordinarily used, _romantic_ means the extreme opposite of
prosaic or commonplace; in literary history, Romantic is used to
describe the movement known as Romanticism. Classic, in its oldest and
ordinary acceptation, means the best of its class or kind; in its
literary sense, _classic_, or _classical_, is usually applied to the
type of literature that harmonized so completely with eighteenth century
rationalism, the Classicism, or rather pseudo-Classicism, which,
enthroned in France, ruled all literary Europe until the closing years
of the century. In the following comparison, Classic, Classicist, and
Classicism are the opposites of Romantic, Romanticist, and Romanticism.

Romanticism, in its general application to all kinds of literature and
to the literatures of all countries where it made itself effectively
felt, shows the following characteristics:

1. _Subjectivity_, the introduction of the personal note, the expression
by the author of his own individual feelings and ideas. The Classicist,
aiming at universality and completeness, considered only the typical and
eternal as suitable material for literature and carefully excluded
whatever seemed peculiar to himself; his ideal was to give perfect
literary form to ideas and sentiments acceptable to mankind generally,
truths of universal application. Originality of idea or sentiment was
not of prime importance with him; his aim was rather to give finished
form to "what oft was said, but ne'er so well expressed." The aim of the
Romanticist, on the other hand, was to turn to literary uses his own
individual experiences, to give forceful and effective, rather than
elegant, expression to his own peculiar feelings and ideas. This
subjectivity led naturally to many abuses; it also led to the production
of some of the masterpieces of literature. Lyric poetry, that had almost
died of inanition during the period of Classicism, took on new and
vigorous life and became again one of the most important literary
genres. The mere mention of such famous poets as Byron, Shelley, Heine,
Musset, Leopardi, Espronceda, indicates the extent and importance of
lyric poetry in the first half of the nineteenth century.

2. _Emotional appeal_. Classicism made its appeal to the intellect;
Romanticism to the emotions. The aim of the Classicist being to give
perfect literary expression to the accumulated wisdom of mankind or to
reform social, moral, or political conditions by means of ridicule, he
accepted logic as his guide. The Romanticist, whose aim it was to
express his individual sentiments and ideas, rebelled against the
restraints of logic and common sense; his purpose was not to persuade
his reader or hearer by logical reasoning, but rather to carry him off
his feet by the onrush of his passions and sentiments. The Classicist
mistrusted the imagination for fear that it might lead him away from
common sense and moderation; the Romanticist turned to it eagerly as the
most effective means of conveying to reader or hearer his ardent
sentiments and vague aspirations. For the reason then that the
Classicist made his appeal to the intellect, mistrusted the imagination,
and usually avoided all strong passions except that of indignation,
Classicism tended to become more and more prosaic. Romanticism, because
of its appeal to the emotions and to the imagination, put new life and
power into literature, and immeasurably widened its range. On the other
hand the tendency on the part of writers of little ability and less
judgment to go to absurd extremes in their efforts to express strange
and original ideas and sentiments, to get as far away as possible from
the logical and commonplace, led to the production of much absurd
writing. This and the attempt of many of them to apply the extreme
principles of Romanticism to daily life as well as to literature
resulted in the derogatory sense that the word _romantic_ came to have
in its ordinary acceptation. The results of Romanticism in its
exaggerated form may be seen in the satirical article written in 1837 by
Mesonero Romanos, _El Romanticismo y los Rom�nticos_. This article,
highly recommended in this connection, may easily be found in his
collected writings _Obras_, Madrid, 1881, or, better still, it may be
studied in the excellent edition of Professor G.T. Northup, _Selections
from Mesonero Romanos_.

3. _Spiritual awakening_. The latter half of the eighteenth century was
a materialistic age. The realities of life were limited to such as could
be understood by the five senses and the reasoning faculty. Life and
literature for the Classicist meant reasoned submission to things as
they were; achievement was the accepted basis of judgment for his life
or literature. The Romanticist rebelled against this materialistic view
of life; for him the real truths lay beyond the apparent realities; he
grasped at the impalpable and infinite, and wished to have his life and
literature judged by his aspirations, rather than by his achievements.
Hence, too, the vague longings, the gentle melancholy or violent revolt,
the spiritual uplift. The new sense of the wonder and glory of the
universe, as well as the spiritual reality behind the material, has
suggested as a definition of Romanticism the "Renascence of Wonder."

4. _Revival of the Middle Ages and national traditions_. The
Romanticists were inclined to turn away from the prosaic present and to
seek material for their writings in the Middle Ages, the time of
unrestrained feelings and emotions, of chivalrous adventure and romance,
of strong religious faith, of miracles and superstition. The historical
novel, in which the powerful imagination of a Walter Scott made the past
live again, became popular throughout Europe; innumerable dramas sought
their plots in medieval history and legend. Spain, with her rich
literature of popular ballads and drama, a storehouse of picturesque
legends and traditions, attracted the attention of Romanticists
everywhere, so that for Spaniards the movement came to have a patriotic
significance. The best Romanticists did not limit themselves to the
Middle Ages; they broadened their vision to include the whole past of
the human race, whereas the Classicists, fixing their eyes steadily upon
ancient Greece and Rome, whenever they were inclined to turn away from
the present, ignored entirely the medieval period and the early modern.

5. _Picturesqueness_. Seeking to give polished expression to the
probable and typical, the Classicist abhorred exaggeration and violent
contrasts. The Romanticist, on the other hand, was attracted to the
grotesque, mingled the ugly and the beautiful, the commonplace and the
fantastic; he delighted in striking antitheses.

6. _Love of inanimate nature_. The Classicist, instead of going directly
to Nature for individual inspiration, was content to repeat in new ways
the generally accepted ideas regarding natural scenery. His interest lay
almost wholly in mankind, so that inanimate Nature usually served as a
merely conventional background. The Romanticist loved Nature for its own
sake, and many masterpieces of lyric poetry were due to its inspiration.
He loved Nature in all her aspects and moods; if these were grandiose or
violent, the greater was his admiration.

7. _Freedom from rule and conventionality in literary forms and
technique._ The foregoing characteristics, concerned mainly with the
content of Romantic literature, would naturally mean a corresponding
revolution in literary form and technique. Rules and conventions had
kept accumulating about literature, until by the middle of the
eighteenth century, when French Classicism dominated literary Europe,
they were so rigid that only a few of the many men of letters were able
to produce literature that was not wholly artificial and uninspired.
Each kind of literature was supposed to be written in a certain way;
narrative poetry had a certain prescribed meter; lyric poetry another;
tragedy and comedy should be carefully kept apart. The Romanticist
proceeded at once to throw overboard all these rules and
conventionalities. Each literary production was to be judged upon its
own merits as literature, not upon the closeness of its adherence to any
set of rules, and each author was to be at liberty to get his results in
any way that he might choose. Hence we find the mingling of literary
genres, the neglect of the dramatic unities, the invention of new meters
and the revival of old ones.

8. _Richness of language_. Because of the continual elimination of words
considered unsuitable for literary expression, the language of the
Classicists was becoming more and more impoverished, diction was
becoming more and more stereotyped and artificial. The Romanticists,
with their revolutionary ideas as to content, rebelled against any rule
or convention that would restrict their choice of words or diction;
seeking complete and effective self-expression, they turned to literary
use all the resources of the language of their own time and of any other
age as well. The result was a great enrichment of language through the
effective use of highly colored, picturesque words and diction, as fresh
and bright as newly coined pieces of gold.

Such are the general characteristics of the movement that had such a
profound effect upon the literatures of western Europe in the closing
years of the eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth.
All of them may be observed in the literature produced in Spain during
the twenty years from 1830 to 1850, although, naturally, they do not all
have the same importance there as in other countries. In a general way
it may be said that the movement was not so revolutionary as in France,
for example, where Classicism had taken deeper root. Moreover, in Spain,
Romanticism meant the revival of some of the literary ideals of the
_Siglo de Oro_, and to this extent at least could hardly be considered
revolutionary. The most complete representative of Romanticism in
Spanish dramatic literature is the _Don �lvaro_ of Angel de Saavedra,
better known as the Duque de Rivas; in this play are to be found all the
above-mentioned characteristics, even those that have to do more
naturally with lyric poetry, subjectivity and love of nature. Not only
does it present Romanticism in its most effective form; it also shows
the pitfalls of exaggeration and improbability that even the greatest
Romanticists failed to avoid when the check of common sense was removed
and free rein was given to the imagination. But since we are here
concerned mainly with _Los Amantes de Teruel_, a play that demands for
its understanding and appreciation much less familiarity with the
Spanish language than that required by _Don �lvaro_, the extent to which
the masterpiece of Hartzenbusch is representative of Romanticism will
now be briefly noted.[5]

[Footnote 5: In order that the student may discover for himself the
essential differences between the two schools of drama, it is
recommended that he read a classical play such as Moratin's _El S� de
las Ni�as_ before reading _Los Amantes de Teruel_. In comparing the two
plays he should bear in mind that, for the reason that they are both
artistic masterpieces, they avoid the extremes of Classicism and
Romanticism, and that they do not illustrate entirely the opposite
characteristics of the less artistic examples of the two kinds of
drama.]

#VII. Romanticism in _Los Amantes de Teruel._# That the appeal is
mainly to the emotions and imagination is quite evident. The plot is
based on a legend that owes its chief interest to the unusual and even
improbable ending; and the exceptional and improbable, if they are to be
effectively treated in literature, must appeal to the imagination, must
so stir the sentiments of the reader or hearer that the reasoning
faculty may be kept from becoming too active. Not only is the
_d�nouement_ itself improbable; the somewhat melodramatic figure of
Zulima and the important part she plays in keeping apart the lovers
until it is too late, would hardly be convincing if the main appeal of
the play were to the intellect. These improbabilities are willingly
ignored by the reader or spectator as he allows himself to be carried
along in the current of passion to the final scene of deep emotion and
intense pathos. Melodious verse and poetic imagery help to make
effective this emotional appeal.

The spiritual appeal of the play is apparent. To Marsilla and Isabel
love is so spiritualized that materialism can find in it no place. Their
love for each other is the "encarnaci�n del cari�o anticipado al nacer,"
life means for them "seguir con el cuerpo amando, como el esp�ritu am�."
Love is life itself; and when no longer permitted to love each other in
this life for the reason that Isabel, believing her lover to be dead and
wishing to sacrifice herself in order that her mother's good name may be
preserved, has become the wife of Rodrigo de Azagra, they willingly
return to the spiritual world from which together _they had come into
the world of materiality_.

The dramatization of a medieval legend is typical of the newly awakened
interest in the Middle Ages. Five years before the beginning of the
supposed action of the play, shortly after Marsilla had left home to
gain name and fortune in the wars against the infidels, was fought at
Navas de Tolosa one of the most decisive battles between Christianity
and Mohammedanism. The year after his departure from Teruel there
ascended the throne of Arag�n the boy that was to be known to history as
_Jaime el Conquistador_ because of his reconquest of southeastern Spain
for Christianity. In the lull that preceded the approaching storm the
Christians and Moslems in the eastern part of the peninsula were at
peace, so that in the play they mingle freely, treating each other with
the chivalrous respect that was characteristic of the Middle Ages. The
numerous references to contemporary historic personages and events and
the careful attention to local color bring vividly before us the life of
that part of Arag�n recently recovered from the Moors. The _d�nouement_
is made less improbable by placing the action of the play in that age of
deep convictions, exalted idealism, chivalrous customs, and in that part
of Spain where tenacity of purpose has always been regarded as a
characteristic trait.

Picturesqueness, in its literary sense is not very apparent in the play
as we now have it. In the first version there were examples of striking
contrasts, a mingling of the tragic and comic, the noble and base, but
these were toned down or eliminated by the author in his revisions of
the play. For an example of exaggerated picturesqueness, with its
violent contrasts, mingling of the sublime and vulgar, the grotesque and
beautiful, the student is referred to _Don �lvaro_.

The classical conventionality that each kind of literature should have
its prescribed form and that the various literary genres should be kept
apart was disregarded by Hartzenbusch. In this play we see a mingling of
scenes in prose with those in verse, we find the versification varied
according to the nature of the scenes, a mingling of dramatic dialogue
and lyrical expression of sentiment and passion. The action of the play
in its first form was impeded by the excessive lyricism of some of the
scenes; although notably reduced, this lyric element is still quite
apparent in the scene between Marsilla and Zulima in the first act, for
example; or between Marsilla and Isabel in the last. In the first
version Mari-G�mez, later changed to Teresa with the suppression of most
of her garrulity, was made to serve as a _graciosa_ and thus relieve the
tenseness of the serious scenes.

As to the three dramatic unities so dear to the Classicists, those of
time and place are disregarded. The action shifts from Valencia to
Teruel; the time occupied covers the last six days of the _plazo_ given
Marsilla in which to gain name and fortune and return home to claim
Isabel for wife. The unity of action, the one essential unity in any
work of art, is carefully preserved. In the first version could be seen
something of the Romantic tendency to complicate the plot by the
introduction of an excessive number of characters and needless episodes,
but in its final form the plot is simple and nothing is permitted to
interfere with its dramatic development.

In the first version there was also some tendency to abuse the new
freedom from conventionality in language, a tendency to seek out unusual
words and phrases for the sake of their picturesqueness, rather than for
their artistic appropriateness. In the polishing and toning-down
process, such words and phrases were eliminated, so that the play in its
final form serves as a good illustration of the permanent enrichment of
the literary language by the Romanticists. Likewise, in its
versification, it offers a good example of the metrical variety found in
the Spanish dramatists of the Golden Age and revived by the
Romanticists.

#VIII. Versification.# Only the fundamental principles of Spanish
versification will be noted here. For a more adequate treatment the
student is referred to such works as Andr�s Bello's _Ortolog�a y
m�trica_ (Vol. IV of _Obras completas_, Madrid, 1890), or the _Prosodia
castellana y versificaci�n_ of E. Benot; or to the more easily
accessible notes on Spanish versification in Hills and Morley's _Modern
Spanish Lyrics_ or Ford's _Spanish Anthology_.

Some knowledge of two of the essential differences between Spanish and
English versification is needed for the appreciation of the poetry of
this play. Whereas in English poetry the number of feet to the line is
essential, in Spanish the basis of meter is the number of syllables;
moreover, in syllable-counting there are certain rules (too complicated
to be given here) regarding the treatment of contiguous vowels as one
syllable or more than one. Another difference that should be noted is
that in Spanish poetry there are two kinds of rime, consonantal rime and
assonance. Consonantal rime is the same as that used in English poetry,
identity of the last stressed vowel sound as well as all following vowel
or consonant sounds in two or more verses; as for example, in lines
127-130, Act I, _clemencia, Valencia: favor, mejor_. Assonance is
identity in a series of verses of the last stressed vowel and of a
following unstressed vowel, if there be one, but not of a consonant; in
other words, assonance is the correspondence of the vowels, but not of
the consonants, in the riming syllables. Thus, in the first 110 lines of
the play, all the even verses have the same vowel in the last stressed
syllables: _volver, administr�, fiel, pie, Adel, partir�, el, rey_, etc.
Only the strong vowel in a diphthong is recognized, so that in these 110
lines the assonance of the alternate verses is in _e_. In the first 148
lines of Act IV all the even verses have one and the same vowel in the
last accented syllable and one and the same vowel in the unaccented
syllable: _pueblo, bandoleros, prenderlos, tiempo, vinieron, provecho_,
etc. The assonance is, therefore, _�-o_.

Of the many verse-forms, _i.e._, definite combinations of line and rime,
to be found in Spanish poetry, we find the following in this play:
_romance, romance heroico, redondilla, quintilla, d�cima, copla de arte
mayor_, and _silva_.

The _romance_, or ballad meter, is the most thoroughly national of all
Spanish meters and has always been very popular with the dramatists. It
has, regularly, eight syllables to the line, with a regular rhythmic
accent on the seventh, and has assonance in the alternate lines. The
seventh syllable may or may not be followed by one or two unstressed
syllables, but the line is called octosyllabic; one unstressed syllable
is counted whether it be present or not. The first 110 lines of Act I,
for example, are in _romance_. Note that the regular rhythmic stress of
each line is on the seventh syllable; that the odd lines have seven or
eight syllables; that all the even lines have seven metrical syllables
each, and have assonance in _e_. In the first 148 lines of Act IV, all
of the even lines have eight syllables each, for the reason that each
seventh syllable is followed by an unaccented syllable, the assonance
being _�-o._ This is the normal _romance_ line, eight-syllabled and in
assonance.

The _romance heroico_ or _real_ differs from the ordinary _romance_ in
that the lines are hendecasyllabic (eleven-syllabled). Lines 269-474,
Act IV, are in _romance heroico_, with assonance in _�-a_.

The _redondilla_ consists of four octosyllabic lines, with consonantal
rime, usually arranged thus: _abba_. In Act I, for example, lines
111-458 consist of 87 _redondillas_.

The _quintilla_ consists of five octosyllabic lines, with two
consonantal rimes, arranged so that no more than two may come together:
_ababa, abbab, abaab_, etc. In Act III lines 62-226 consist of 33
_quintillas_. The last one has a very unusual combination of rimes:
_abbba_.

The _d�cima_ consists of ten octosyllabic lines, with four consonantal
rimes usually arranged as in lines 761-770, or 771-780, Act II:
_abbaaccddc_. The _d�cima_ is not properly considered as two
_quintillas_, since there should be a pause at the end of the fourth
line of a _d�cima_.

The _copla_ (stanza) _de arte mayor_ contains eight lines with three
consonantal rimes arranged thus: _abbaacca_. Each line is divided into
two hemistitches, with rhythmic stress on the fifth syllable of each
hemistich. The sixth syllable of either hemistich or of both may be
lacking, so that there may be a total of 10, 11, or 12 syllables in a
line. Lines 179-282, Act II, are made up of thirteen _coplas de arte
mayor_. Most of the lines have 11 or 12 syllables; note that verses 187,
200, 215, etc., have only ten each.

The _silva_ is usually composed of eleven-syllabled lines, intermingled
with lines of seven syllables. There is consonantal rime, but without
regularity; and many lines are left unrimed. An example of the _silva_
may be found in lines 309-437, Act III.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

The most important books and articles that treat of Hartzenbusch and the
legend of the _Amantes de Teruel_ have already been mentioned. In them
may be found many references and extensive bibliographical data. The
best of the writings of Hartzenbusch are contained in the five volumes
published in the well-known series _Colecci�n de Escritores
Castellanos_. Three volumes contain his best plays: _Teatro_, Madrid,
1888-1892. The first volume, _Poes�as_, 1887, contains a good study of
his life and writings by A. Fern�ndez-Guerra. The Romantic movement in
Spain is treated at length in _El Romanticismo en Espa�a_, by Enrique
Pineyro, Paris, 1904; and in Vol. I, of _La Literatura Espa�ola en el
Siglo XIX_, by F. Blanco-Garc�a, 3d edition, 1909.

          T� nos habr�s acechado.

OSM�N.    He cumplido mi deber.                                   80
          Al ausentarse el Amir,
          con este encargo qued�.
          Es m�s cauto nuestro due�o
          que esa liviana mujer.--
          El lienzo escrito con sangre,                           85
          �d�nde est�?

ADEL.                 All�. (_Se�alando la cama_.)

OSM�N.                       Venga.

ADEL.                               Ten.
               (_Le da el lienzo, y Osm�n lee_.)
          Mira si es que dice, ya
          que t� lo sabes leer,
          d�nde lo pudo escribir;
          porque en el encierro aquel                             90
          apenas penetra nunca
          rayo de luz: verdad es
          que rotas esta ma�ana
          puerta y cadenas hall�:
          debi�, despu�s de romperlas,                            95
          el subterr�neo correr,
          y hallando el lienzo....

OSM�N (_asombrado de lo que ha le�do_.) �Es posible!

ADEL.     �Qu� cosa?

OSM�N.              �Oh, vasallo infiel!
          Avisar al Rey es fuerza,
          y al p�rfido sorprender.                                100

ADEL.     �Es �ste el p�rfido? (_Se�alando a Marsilla_.)

OSM�N.                         No;
          ese noble aragon�s
          hoy el salvador ser�
          de Valencia y de su Rey.

ADEL.     Zulima viene.

OSM�N.                       Silencio                             105
          con ella, y al punto ve
          a buscarme. (_Vase_.)

ADEL.                      Norabuena.
          As� me har�s la merced
          de explicarme lo que pasa.



          ESCENA III


ZULIMA.--ADEL, MARSILLA

ZULIMA.   D�jame sola.

ADEL.                   Est� bien.    (_Vase_.)                   110



          ESCENA IV


ZULIMA, MARSILLA

ZULIMA.   Su pecho empieza a latir
          m�s fuerte; as� que perciba....
             (_Apl�cale un pomito a la nariz_.)

MARSILLA. �Ah!

ZULIMA.        Volvi�.

MARSILLA (_incorpor�ndose_.) �Qu� luz tan viva!
          no la puedo resistir.

ZULIMA (_corriendo las cortinas de la ventana_).
          De aquella horrible mansi�n                             115
          est� a las tinieblas hecho.

MARSILLA. No es esto piedra, es un lecho.
          �Qu� ha sido de mi prisi�n?

ZULIMA.   Mira este albergue despacio,
          y abre el coraz�n al gozo.                              120

MARSILLA. �Se�ora!.... (_Reparando en ella_.)

ZULIMA.                 Tu calabozo
          se ha convertido en palacio.

MARSILLA. Di (porque yo no me explico
          milagro tal), di, �qu� es esto?

ZULIMA.   Que eras esclavo, y que presto                          125
          vas a verte libre y rico.

MARSILLA. �Libre! �Oh divina clemencia!
          Y �a qui�n debo tal favor?

ZULIMA.   �Qui�n puede hacerle mejor
          que la Reina de Valencia?                               130
          Zulima te proporciona
          la sorpresa que te embarga
          dulcemente: ella me encarga
que cuide de tu persona:
          y desde hoy ning�n af�n                                 135
          permitir� que te aflija.

MARSILLA. �Eres?....

ZULIMA.              Dama suya, hija
          del valeroso Merv�n.

MARSILLA. �De Merv�n? (_Aparte_. �Ah! �qu�
          recuerdo!) (_Busca y recoge el lienzo_.)

ZULIMA.   �Qu� buscas tan azorado?                                140
          �Ese lienzo ensangrentado?

MARSILLA (_aparte_.) Si �sta lo sabe, me pierdo.

ZULIMA.   �Que has escrito en �l?

MARSILLA.                         No va
          esto dirigido a ti;
          es para el Rey.

ZULIMA.                  No est� aqu�.                            145

MARSILLA. Para la Reina ser�.
          Haz, pues, que a mi bienhechora
          vea: por Dios te lo ruego.

ZULIMA.   Conocer�s aqu� luego
          a la Reina tu se�ora.                                   150

MARSILLA. �Oh!....

ZULIMA.              No est�s con inquietud.
          Olvida todo pesar:
          trata solo de cobrar
          el sosiego y la salud.

MARSILLA. Defienda pr�vido el cielo                               155
          y premie con altos dones
          los piadosos corazones
          que dan al triste consuelo.
          Tendr� Zulima, tendr�s
          t� siempre un cautivo en m�;                            160
          hermoso es el bien por s�,
          pero en una hermosa, m�s.
          Ayer, hoy mismo, �cu�l era
          mi suerte? Sumido en honda
          c�rcel, estrecha y hedionda,                            165
          sin luz, sin aire siquiera;
          envuelto en infecta nube
          que h�medo engendra el terreno;
          paja corrompida, cieno
          y piedras por cama tuve.                                170
          --Hoy ... si no es esto so�ar,
          torno a la luz, a la vida,
          y espero ver la florida
          margen del Guadalaviar,
          all� donde alza Teruel,                                 175
          se�oreando la altura,
          sus torres de piedra oscura,
          que est�n mir�ndose en �l.
          No es lo m�s que me redima
          la noble princesa mora:                                 180
          el bien que me hace, lo ignora
          aun la propia Zulima.

ZULIMA.   Ella siempre alg�n misterio
          supuso en ti, y as� espera
          que me des noticia entera                               185
          de tu vida y cautiverio.
          Una vez que en tu retiro
          las dos ocultas entramos,
          te o�mos ... y sospechamos
          que no es tu nombre Ramiro.                             190

MARSILLA. Mi nombre es Diego Marsilla,
          y cuna Teruel me di�,
          pueblo que ayer se fund�,
          y es hoy poderosa villa,
          cuyos muros, entre horrores                             195
          de lid atroz levantados,
          fueron con sangre amasados
          de sus fuertes pobladores.
          Yo creo que al darme ser
          quiso formar el Se�or,                                  200
          modelos de puro amor,
          un hombre y una mujer,
          y para hacer la igualdad
          de sus afectos cumplida,
          les di� un alma en dos partida,                         205
          y dijo: �Vivid y amad.�
          Al son de la voz creadora,
          Isabel y yo existimos,
          y ambos los ojos abrimos
          en un d�a y una hora.                                   210
          Desde los a�os m�s tiernos
          fuimos ya finos amantes;
          desde que nos vimos ... antes
          nos am�bamos de vernos;
          porque el amor principi�                                215
          a enardecer nuestras almas
          al contacto de las palmas
          de Dios, cuando nos cri�:
          y as� fu� nuestro querer,
          prodigioso en ni�a y ni�o,                              220
          encarnaci�n del cari�o
          anticipado al nacer,
          seguir Isabel y yo,
          al triste mundo arribando,
          seguir con el cuerpo amando,                            225
          como el esp�ritu am�.

ZULIMA.   Inclinaci�n tan igual
          s�lo dichas pronostica.

MARSILLA. Soy pobre, Isabel es rica.

ZULIMA (_aparte_). Respiro.

MARSILLA.                        Tuve un rival.                   230

ZULIMA.   �S�?

MARSILLA.      Y opulento.

ZULIMA.                     Y bien....

MARSILLA.                              Hizo
          alarde de su riqueza....

ZULIMA.   �Y qu�? �rindi� la firmeza
          de Isabel?

MARSILLA.            Es poco hechizo
          el oro para quien ama.                                  235
          Su padre, s�, deslumbrado....

ZULIMA.   �Tu amor dej� desairado,
          priv�ndote de tu dama?

MARSILLA. Le v�, mi pasi�n habl�,
          su fuerza exhalando toda,                               240
          y, suspendida la boda,
          un plazo se me otorg�,
          para que mi esfuerzo activo
          juntara un caudal honrado.

ZULIMA.   �Es ya el t�rmino pasado?                               245

MARSILLA. Se�ora, ya ves ... aun vivo.
          Seis a�os y una semana
me dieron: los a�os ya
          se cumplen hoy; cumplir�
          el primer d�a ma�ana.                                   250

ZULIMA.   Sigue.

MARSILLA.       Un adi�s a la hermosa
          d�, que es de mis ojos luz,
          y combat� por la cruz
          en las Navas de Tolosa.
          Gan� con brioso porte                                   255
          cr�dito all� de guerrero;
          luego, en Francia, prisionero
          ca� del Conde Monforte.
          Hu�, y en Siria un franc�s
          albigense, refugiado,                                   260
          a quien hab�a salvado
          la vida junto a Besi�s,
          me dej�, al morir, su herencia:
          volviendo con fama y oro
          a Espa�a, pirata moro                                   265
          me apres� y trajo a Valencia.
          Y en pena de que rompi�
          de mis cadenas el hierro
          mi mano, profundo encierro
          en vida me sepult�,                                     270
          donde mi extra�o custodio,
          sin dejarse ver ni o�r,
          me prolongaba el vivir,
          o por piedad o por odio.
          De aquel horrendo lugar                                 275
          me sac�is: bella mujer,
          sentir s� y agradecer:
          di c�mo podr� pagar.

ZULIMA.   No borres de tu memoria
          tan debido ofrecimiento,                                280
          y haz por escuchar atento
          cierta peregrina historia.
          Un joven aragon�s
          vino cautivo al serallo:
          sus prendas y nombre callo;                             285
          t� conocer�s qui�n es.
          Toda mujer se lastima
          de ver padecer sonrojos
          a un noble: puso los ojos
          en el esclavo Zulima,                                   290
          y f�rvido amor en breve
          naci� de la compasi�n:
          aqu� es brasa el coraz�n;
          all� entre vosotros, nieve.
          Quiso aquel joven huir;                                 295
          fu� desgraciado en su empe�o:
          le prenden, y por su due�o
          es condenado a morir.
          Pero en favor del cristiano
          velaba Zulima; ciega,                                   300
          loca, le salva;--m�s, llega
          a brindarle con su mano.
          Respuesta es bien se le d�
          en trance tan decisivo:
          habla t� por el cautivo,                                305
          yo por la Reina hablar�.

MARSILLA. Ni en desgracia ni en ventura
          cupo en mi lenguaje dolo:
          este coraz�n es s�lo
          para Isabel de Segura.                                  310

ZULIMA.   Medita, y conceder�s
          al tiempo lo que reclama.
          �Sabes t� si es fiel tu dama?
          �Sabes t� si la ver�s?

MARSILLA. Me matara mi dolor,                                     315
          si fuera Isabel perjura:
          mi constancia me asegura
          la firmeza de su amor.
          Con esp�ritu gallardo,
          si quer�is, dar� mi vida:                               320
          dada el alma y recibida,
          fiel al due�o se la guardo.

ZULIMA.   Mira que es poco prudente
          burlar a tu soberana,
          que tiene sangre africana,                              325
          y ama y odia f�cilmente.
          Y si ella sabe que, cuando
          yo su coraz�n te ofrezco,
          por ella el dolor padezco
          de ver que le est�s pisando,                            330
          volver�s a tus cadenas
          y a tu negro calabozo,
          y all� yo, con alborozo
          que m�s encone tus penas,
          la nueva te llevar�                                     335
          de ser Isabel esposa.

MARSILLA. Y en prisi�n tan horrorosa
          �cu�ntos d�as vivir�?

ZULIMA.   �Rayo del cielo! el traidor
          cuanto fabrico derrumba:                                340
          defendido con la tumba,
          se r�e de mi furor.
          Trocar�s la risa en llanto.
          Cautiva desde Teruel
          me han de traer a Isabel....                            345

MARSILLA. �Qui�n eres t� para tanto?

ZULIMA.   Tiembla de m�.

MARSILLA. Furia vana.

ZULIMA.   �Insensato! La que ves,
          no es hija de Merv�n, es
          Zulima.

MARSILLA. �T� la Sultana!                                         350

ZULIMA.   La Reina.

MARSILLA. Toma, con eso
            (_D�ndole el lienzo ensangrentado_.)
          correspondo a tu afici�n:
          entrega sin dilaci�n
          a hombre de valor y seso
          el escrito que te doy.                                  355
          S�lvete su diligencia.

ZULIMA.   �C�mo! �Qu� riesgo?...

MARSILLA. A Valencia
          tu esposo ha de llegar hoy;
          y en llegando, t� y �l y otros
          a sedicioso pu�al                                       360
          perec�is.

ZULIMA.   �Qu� desleal
          conspira contra nosotros?

MARSILLA. Merv�n, tu padre supuesto.
          Si tu c�lera no estalla,
          mi labio el secreto calla,                              365
          y el fin os llega funesto.

ZULIMA.   �C�mo tal conjuraci�n
          a ti!....

MARSILLA.          Fren�tico ayer,
          la puerta pude romper
          de mi encierro: la prisi�n                              370
          recorro, oigo hablar, atiendo....
          --Junta de aleves imp�a
          era, Merv�n presid�a.--
          All� supe que volviendo
          a este alc�zar el Amir,                                 375
          trataban de asesinarle.
          Resu�lvome a no dejarle
          p�rfidamente morir,
          y con roja tinta humana
          y un pincel de mi cabello                               380
          la trama en un lienzo sello,
          y el modo de hacerla vana.
          Poner al siguiente d�a
          pensaba el �til aviso
          en la cesta que el preciso                              385
          sustento me conduc�a.
          Venci�me tenaz modorra,
          m�s fuerte que mi cuidado:
          despert� maravillado,
          fuera ya de la mazmorra.                                390
          Junta pues tu guardia, pon
          aqu� un acero, y que venga
          con todo el poder que tenga
          contra ti la rebeli�n.

ZULIMA.   D� a la rebeli�n castigo                                395
          quien tema por su poder;
          no yo, que al anochecer
          huir pensaba contigo.
          Poca gente, pero brava,
          que al marchar nos protegiera,                          400
          sumisa mi voz espera
          escondida en la alcazaba.
          Con ellos entre el rebato
          del tumulto, partir�;
          con ellos negociar�                                     405
          que me venguen de un ingrato.
          Teme la cuchilla airada
          de Za�n, el bandolero;
          tiembla, m�s que de su acero,
          de esta daga envenenada.                                410
          �Ay del que mi amor troc�
          en frenes� rencoroso!
          �Nunca espere ser dichoso
          quien de celos me mat�!

MARSILLA. �Zulima!... �Se�ora !...                                415

OSM�N.--MARSILLA.

OSM�N                             Baste
          de pl�tica sin provecho.
          Al Rey un favor has hecho:
          acaba lo que empezaste.

MARSILLA. �C�mo! �t�?....

OSM�N.                          El lienzo he le�do
          que al Rey dirigiste: all�                              420
          le ofreces tu brazo.

MARSILLA.                       S�,
          armas y riesgo le pido.

OSM�N.    Pues bien, dos tropas formadas
          con los cautivos est�n:
          ser�s el un capit�n,                                    425
          el otro Jaime Celladas.

MARSILLA. �Jaime est� aqu�! Es mi paisano,
          es mi amigo.

OSM�N.                Si hay combate,
          as� tendr� su rescate
          cada cautivo en la mano.                                430
          Con ardimiento lidiad.

MARSILLA. �Qui�n, de libertad sediento,
          no lidia con ardimiento
          al grito de libertad!

OSM�N.    Cuanto a Zulima....

MARSILLA.                    Tambi�n                              435
          Libre ha de ser.

OSM�N.                     No debiera;
          pero ll�vesela fuera
          de nuestro reino Za�n.

ADEL, SOLDADOS MOROS.--MARSILLA, OSM�N

ADEL.     Osm�n, a palacio van
          turbas llegando en tumulto,                             440
          y Za�n, que estaba oculto,
          sale aclamando a Merv�n.
          Zulima nos ha vendido.

OSM�N.    Ya no hay perd�n que le alcance.

MARSILLA. Despu�s de correr el lance,                             445
          se dispondr� del vencido.
          Cuando rueda la corona
          entre la sangre y el fuego,
          primero se triunfa, luego....

OSM�N.    Se castiga.

MARSILLA. Se perdona.                                             450

VOCES (_dentro_). �Muera el tirano!

          Guarda el torre�n, Adel.

ADEL.     Ten tu acero. (_D�sele a Marsilla_.)

          Ella al triunfo te encamina.
          Rayo fu� de Palestina,

Teruel.--Sala en casa de don Pedro Segura



           ESCENA PRIMERA


DON PEDRO, entrando en su casa; MARGARITA, ISABEL y TERESA,
saliendo a recibirle


MARGARITA. �Esposo! (_Arrodill�ndose_.)

ISABEL.             �Padre! (_Arrodill�ndose_.)

TERESA.                     �Se�or!

PEDRO.     �Hija! �Margarita! Alzad.

ISABEL.    Dadme a besar vuestra mano.

MARGARITA. D�jame el suelo besar
           que pisas.

TERESA (_a Margarita_). Vaya, se�ora,                             5
           ya es vicio tanta humildad.

PEDRO.     Pedazos del coraz�n,
           no es ese vuestro lugar.
           Abrazadme. (_Levanta y abraza a las dos_.)

TERESA.               As� me gusta.
           Y a m� luego.

PEDRO.                 Ven ac�,                                   10
           fiel Teresa.

TERESA.                Fiel y franca,
           tengo en ello vanidad.

PEDRO.     Ya he vuelto, por fin.

MARGARITA.                        Dios quiso
           mis plegarias escuchar.

PEDRO.     Gustoso a Monz�n part�,                                15
           comisionado especial
           para ofrecer a don Jaime
           las tropas que alistar�
           nuestra villa de Teruel
           en defensa de la paz,                                  20
           que don Sancho y don Fernando
           nos quieren arrebatar:
           fu� don Rodrigo de Azagra,
           obsequioso y liberal,
           acompa��ndome al ir,                                   25
           y me acompa�a al tornar;
           mas yo me acordaba siempre
           de vosotras con af�n.
           Triste se qued� Isabel;
           m�s triste la encuentro.

TERESA.                           Ya.                             30

MARGARITA. �Teresa!

ISABEL.            �Padre!

PEDRO.                      Hija m�a,
           dime con sinceridad
           lo que ha pasado en mi ausencia.

TERESA.    Poco tiene que contar.

MARGARITA. �Teresa!

TERESA.             Digo bien. �Es                                35
           por ventura novedad
           que Isabel suspire, y vos (_a Margarita_)
           rec�is, y ayun�is a pan
           y agua, y os and�is curando
           enfermos por caridad?                                  40
           Es la vida que tra�is,
           lo menos, quince a�os ha....

MARGARITA. Basta.

TERESA.           Y hace seis cumplidos
           que no se ha visto asomar
           en los labios de Isabel                                45
           ni una sonrisa fugaz.

ISABEL (_aparte_). �Ay, mi bien!

TERESA.                               En fin, se�or,
           del pobrecillo don Juan
           Diego de Marsilla, nada
           se sabe.

MARGARITA. Si no call�is,                                         50
           venid conmigo.

TERESA.                    Ir con vos
           f�cil es; pero callar....

(_Vanse Margarita y Teresa. Don Pedro se quita la espada
y la pone sobre un bufete_.)



           ESCENA II


DON PEDRO, ISABEL

PEDRO.     Mucho me aflige, Isabel,
           tu pesadumbre tenaz;
           pero, por desgracia, yo                                55
           no la puedo remediar.
           Esclavo de su palabra
           es el var�n principal;
           tengo empe�ada la m�a:
           la debo desempe�ar.                                    60
           En el honor de tu padre
           no se vi� mancha jam�s:
           juventud honrada pide
           m�s honrada ancianidad.

ISABEL.    No pretendo yo....

PEDRO.                       Por otra                             65
           parte, parece que est�n
           de Dios ciertas cosas. Oye
           un lance bien singular,
           y di si no tiene traza
           de caso providencial.                                  70

ISABEL.    A ver.

PEDRO.           En Teruel vivi�
           (no s� si te acordar�s)
           un tal Roger de Lizana,
           caballero catal�n.                                     75

ISABEL.    �El templario?

PEDRO.                   S�. Roger
           paraba en Monz�n. All�
           es voz que penas y culpas
           de su libre mocedad
           traj�ronle una dolencia
           de esp�ritu y corporal,                                80
           que vino a dejarle casi
           mudo, imb�cil, incapaz.
           Pac�fico en su idiotez,
           permit�anle vagar
           libre por el pueblo. Un d�a,                           85
           sobre una dificultad
           en mi encargo y sobre c�mo
           se debiera de allanar,
           don Rodrigo y yo soltamos
           palabras de enemistad.                                 90
           March�se enojado, y yo
           exclam� al verle marchar:
           ��Ha de ser este hombre due�o
           de lo que yo quiero m�s?
           Si la muerte puede sola                                95
           mi palabra desatar,
           ll�veme el Se�or, y quede
           Isabel en libertad.�

ISABEL.    �Oh padre!

PEDRO.               En esto, un empuje
           tremendo a la puerta dan,                              100
           se abre, y con pu�al en mano
           entra....

ISABEL.             �Virgen del Pilar!
           �Qui�n?

PEDRO.            Roger. Ll�gase a m�,
           y en voz pronunciada mal,
           �Uno (dijo) de los dos                                 105
           la vida aqu� dejar�.�

ISABEL.    Y �qu� hicisteis?

PEDRO.                      Yo, pensando
           que bien pudiera quiz�s
           mi muerte impedir alguna
           mayor infelicidad,                                     110
           cruc� los brazos, y quieto
           esper� el golpe mortal.

ISABEL.    �Cielos! �Y Roger?

PEDRO.                       Roger
           parado al ver mi adem�n,
           en lugar de acometerme,                                115
           se fu� retirando atr�s,
           mir�ndome de hito en hito,
           llena de terror la faz.
           Asi� con entrambas manos
           el arma por la mitad,                                  120
           y se�as distintas hizo
           de quer�rmela entregar.
           Yo no le atend�, guardando
           completa inmovilidad
           como antes; y �l, con los ojos                         125
           fijos, y sin menear
           los p�rpados, balbuciente
           dijo: �Matadme, salvad
           en el hueco de mi tumba
           mi secreto criminal.�                                  130

ISABEL.   �Su secreto!

PEDRO.                En fin, de estarse
          tanto sin pesta�ear,
          �l, cuyos sentidos eran
          la suma debilidad,
          se trastorn�, cay�; di�                                 135
          la guarnici�n del pu�al
          en tierra, le fu� la punta
          al coraz�n a parar
          al infeliz, y a mis plantas
          rindi� el aliento vital.                                140
          Hu� con espanto: Azagra,
          vini�ndose a disculpar
          conmigo, me hall�; le dije
          que no pisaba el umbral
          de aquella casa en mi vida;                             145
          y �l, pr�vido y eficaz,
          avis� al rey, y mand�
          el cad�ver sepultar.--
          Ya ves, hija: por no ir
          yo contra tu voluntad,                                  150
          por no cumplir mi palabra,
          quise dejarme matar;
          y Dios me guard� la vida:
          su decreto celestial
          es sin duda que esa boda                                155
          se haga por fin ... --y se har�,
          si en tres d�as no parece
          tu preferido gal�n.

ISABEL (_aparte_). �Ay de �l y de m�!

TERESA.--DON PEDRO, ISABEL

TERESA.                    Se�or,
           acaba de preguntar                                     160
           por vos don Mart�n, el padre
           de don Diego.

ISABEL (_aparte_).    �Si sabr�?...

TERESA.    Como es enemigo vuestro,
           le he dejado en el zagu�n.

PEDRO.     A enemigo noble se abren                               165
           las puertas de par en par.
           Que llegue. (_Vase Teresa_.) Ve con tu
           madre.

ISABEL (_aparte_). Ella a sus pies me ver�
           llorando, hasta que consiga
           vencer su severidad. (_Vase_.)                         170

           DON PEDRO

           Desafiados quedamos
           al tiempo de cabalgar
           yo para Monz�n: el duelo
           llevar a cabo querr�.
           Bien.--Pero �l ha padecido                             175
           una larga enfermedad.
           Si no tiene el brazo firme,
           conmigo no lidiar�.



           ESCENA V


DON MART�N.--DON PEDRO

MART�N.   Don Pedro Segura, se�is bien venido.

PEDRO.    Y vos, don Mart�n Garc�s de Marsilla,                   180
          se�is bien hallado: tomad una silla.

(_Si�ntase don Mart�n, mientras don Pedro va a tomar su
espada_.)

MART�N.   Dejad vuestra espada.

PEDRO (_sent�ndose_).      Con pena he sabido
          la grave dolencia que hab�is padecido.

MART�N.   Al fin me repuse del todo.
PEDRO.                               No s�....

MART�N.   Domingo Celladas....

PEDRO.                     �Fuerte hombre es, a fe!               185

MART�N.   Pues aun a la barra le gano el partido.

PEDRO.    As� os quiero yo. Desde hoy, elegid
          al duelo aplazado seguro lugar.

MART�N.   Don Pedro, yo os tengo primero que hablar.

PEDRO.    Hablad en buen hora: ya escucho. Decid.                 190

MART�N.   Caus� nuestra ri�a....

PEDRO.                           La causa omitid:
          sab�mosla entrambos. Por vos se me dijo
          que soy un avaro, y os privo de un hijo.
          De honor es la ofensa, precisa la lid.

MART�N.   �Ten�isme por hombre de aliento?

PEDRO.                                      S� tal.               195
          Si no lo creyera, con vos no lidiara.

MART�N.   Jam�s al peligro le vuelvo la cara.

PEDRO.    S�, nuestro combate puede ser igual.

MART�N.    Ser� por lo mismo....

PEDRO.                          Sangriento, mortal.
           Ha de perecer uno de los dos.                          200

MART�N.    O�d un suceso, feliz para vos...
           Feliz para entrambos.

PEDRO.                          Dec�dmele. �Cu�l?

MART�N.    Tres meses har� que en lecho de duelo
           me puso la mano que todo lo gu�a.
           Del riesgo asustada la familia m�a                     205
           quiso en vuestra esposa buscar su consuelo.
           Con tino infalible, con pr�vido celo
           salud en la villa ben�fica vierte,
           y enfermo en que airada se ceba la muerte,
           le salva su mano, bendita del cielo.                   210
           Con vos irritado, no quise atender
           al dulce consejo de amante inquietud.
           �No cobre (dec�a) jam�s la salud,
           si mano enemiga la debe traer.�
           Mayor mi tes�n a m�s padecer,                          215
           la muerte en mi alcoba plant� su bandera.
           Por fin, una noche... �Qu� noche tan fiera!
           Blasfemo el dolor hac�ame ser;
           ped�a una daga con furia tenaz,
           rasgar anhelando con ella mi pecho...                  220
           En esto a mis puertas, y luego a mi lecho,
           lleg� un peregrino, cubierta la faz.
           �ngel parec�a de salud y paz...
           Me habla, me consuela, benigno licor
           al labio me pone; me alivia el dolor,                  225
           y parte, y no quiere quitarse el disfraz.
La noche que tuve su postrer visita,
           ya restablecido, sus pasos segu�.
           Cruz� varias calles, viniendo hacia aqu�,
           y entr� en esa ruina de g�tica ermita,                 230
           que a vuestros jardines t�rminos limita.
           Det�vele entonces: el velo cay�,
           radiante la luna su rostro alumbr� ...
           era vuestra esposa.

PEDRO.                        �Era Margarita!

MART�N.    Confuso un momento, cobr�me despu�s,                   235
           y vi�me postrado la noble se�ora.
           --Con tal beneficio, no cabe que ahora
           provoque mi mano sangriento rev�s.
           Don Pedro Segura, decid a quien es
           deudor este padre de verse con vida,                   240
           que est� la contienda por m� fenecida.
           Tomad este acero, ponedle a sus pi�s.

     (_Da su espada a don Pedro, que la coloca en el bufete_.)

PEDRO.     �Feliz yo, que logro el duelo excusar
           con vos, por motivo que es tan lisonjero!
           Si pronto me hallasteis, por ser caballero,            245
           cuidado me daba el ir a lidiar.
           Con tal compa�era, �qui�n no ha de arriesgar
           con susto la vida que lleva dichosa?
           Ella me ser� desde hoy m�s preciosa,
           si ya vuestro amigo quer�isme llamar.                  250

MART�N.    Amigos seremos. (_Danse las manos_.)

PEDRO.                    Siempre.

MART�N.                           Siempre, s�.

PEDRO.     Y al cabo, �qu� nuevas ten�is de don Diego?
           En hora menguada, vencido del ruego
           de Azagra, la triste palabra le d�.
           Si antes vuestro hijo se dirige a m�,                  255
           �cu�nto ambas familias se ahorran de llanto!
           No lo quiso Dios.

MART�N.                     Yo su nombre santo
           bendigo; mas lloro por lo que perd�.

PEDRO.     Pero, �qu�...?

MART�N.                   Despu�s de la de Maurel,
           donde cay� en manos del Conde Sim�n,                   260
           de nadie consigo se�al ni raz�n,
           por m�s que anhelante pregunto por �l.
           Cada d�a al cielo con s�plica fiel
           pido que me diga qu� punto en la tierra
           sosti�nele vivo, o muerto le encierra:                 265
           mundo y cielo guardan silencio cruel.

PEDRO.     El plazo no tuvo su fin todav�a.
           Piedad atesora inmensa el Eterno:
           y mucho me holgara si fuera mi yerno
           quien a mi Isabel tan fino quer�a.                     270
           Pero si no viene, y c�mplese el d�a,
           y llega la hora ... por m�s que me pesa,
           me tiene sujeto sagrada promesa:
           si fuera posible, no la cumplir�a.

MART�N.    Diligencia escasa, fortuna severa                      275
           parece que en suerte a mi sangre cupo:
           quien a la desgracia sujetar no supo,
           sufrido se muestre cuando ella le hiera.
           Adi�s.

PEDRO.             No han de veros de aquesa manera.
          Yo quiero esta espada; la m�a tomad
                     (_D�sela_.)                                  280
          en prenda segura de fiel amistad.

MART�N.   Acepto: un monarca llevarla pudiera.

(_Vase don Mart�n, y don Pedro le acompa�a_.)



           ESCENA VI


MARGARITA, ISABEL

MARGARITA (_aparte, siguiendo con la vista a los dos que se
                retiran_.)
           Aunque nada les o�,
           deben estar ya los dos
           reconciliados.

ISABEL (_que viene tras su madre_). Por Dios,                     285
           madre, haced caso de m�.

MARGARITA. No; que es repugnancia loca
           la que mostr�is a un enlace,
           que de seguro nos hace
           a todos, merced no poca.                               290
           Noble sois; pero mirad
           que quien su amor os consagra
           es don Rodrigo de Azagra,
           que goza m�s calidad,
           m�s bienes: en Arag�n                                  295
           le acatan propios y ajenos,
           y muestra, con vos al menos,
           apacible condici�n.

ISABEL.    Vengativo y orgulloso
           es lo que me ha parecido.                              300

MARGARITA. Vuestro padre le ha cre�do
           digno de ser vuestro esposo.
           Prendarse de quien le cuadre
           no es l�cito a una doncella,
           ni hay m�s voluntad en ella                            305
           que la que tenga su padre.
           Hoy d�a, Isabel, as�
           se conciertan nuestras bodas:
           as� nos casan a todas,
           y as� me han casado a m�.                              310

ISABEL.    �No hay a los tormentos m�os
           otro consuelo que dar?

MARGARITA. No me ten�is que mentar
           vuestros locos amor�os.
           Yo por delirios no abogo.                              315
           Idos.

ISABEL.         En vano esper�.
            (_Sollozando al retirarse_.)

MARGARITA. �Qu�! �llor�is?

ISABEL.                   Aun no me fu�
           vedado este desahogo.

MARGARITA. Isabel, si no os escucho,
           no me acus�is de rigor.                                320
           Comprendo vuestro dolor,
           y le compadezco mucho;
           pero, hija ... cuatro a�os ha
           que a nadie Marsilla escribe.
           Si ha muerto....

ISABEL.                     �No, madre, vive!....                 325
           Pero �c�mo vivir�?
           Tal vez, llorando, en Sion
           arrastra por m� cadenas,
           quiz� gime en las arenas
           de la l�bica regi�n.                                   330
           Con aviso tan funesto
           no habr� querido afligirme.
           Yo trato de persuadirme,
           y sin cesar pienso en esto.
           Yo me propuse aprender                                335
           a olvidarle, sospechando
           que infiel estaba, gozando
           caricias de otra mujer.
           Yo escuch� de su rival
           los acentos desabridos,                                340
           y logr� de mis o�dos
           que no me sonaran mal.
           Pero �ay! cuando la raz�n
           iba a proclamarse ufana
           vencedora soberana                                     345
           de la rebelde pasi�n,
           al recordar la memoria
           un suspiro de mi ausente,
           se arruinaba de repente
           la fortaleza ilusoria,                                 350
           y con �mpetu mayor,
           tras el combate perdido,
           se entraba por mi sentido
           a sangre y fuego el amor.
           Yo entonces a la virtud                                355
           nombre daba de fals�a,
           rabioso llanto vert�a,
           y hundirme en el ata�d
juraba en mi frenes�
           antes que rendirme al yugo                             360
           de ese hombre, fatal verdugo,
           genio infernal para m�.

MARGARITA. Por Dios, por Dios, Isabel,
           moderad ese delirio:
           vos no sab�is el martirio                              365
           que me hac�is pasar con �l.

ISABEL.    �Qu�! �mi audacia os maravilla?
           Pero estando ya tan lleno
           el coraz�n de veneno,
           fuerza es que rompa su orilla.                         370
           No a vos, a la piedra inerte
           de esa muralla desnuda,
           a esa b�veda que muda
           oy� mi queja de muerte,
           a este suelo donde mella                               375
           pudo hacer el llanto m�o,
           a no ser tan duro y fr�o
           como alguno que le huella,
           para testigos invoco
           de mi doloroso af�n;                                   380
           que, si alivio no le dan,
           no les ofende tampoco.

MARGARITA (_aparte_). �Qui�n con �nimo sereno
           la oyera?--El dolor mitiga;
           de una madre, de una amiga                             385
           ven al cari�oso seno.
           Con�ceme, y no te ahuyente
           la faz severa que ves:
           m�scara forzosa es,
           que di� el pesar a mi frente;                          390
           pero tras ella te espera,
           para templar tu dolor,
           el tierno, indulgente amor
           de una madre verdadera.

ISABEL.    �Madre m�a! (_Abr�zanse._)

MARGARITA.             Mi ternura                                 395
           te ocult� ... porque deb�...
           �Ha quince a�os que hay aqu�
           guardada tanta amargura!
           Yo hubiera en tu amor filial
           gozado, y gozar no debo
           nada ya, desde que llevo                               400
           el cilicio y el sayal.

ISABEL.    �Madre!

MARGARITA.         Tem�, recel�
           dar a tu amor incentivo,
           y s�lo por correctivo                                  405
           severidad te mostr�;
           mas oy�ndote gemir
           cada noche desde el lecho,
           y a veces en tu despecho
           mis rigores maldecir,                                  410
           yo al Se�or, de silencioso
           materno llanto hecha un mar,
           ofrec� mil veces dar
           mi vida por tu reposo.

ISABEL.    �Cielos! �Qu� revelaci�n                               415
           tan grata! �Qu� injusta he sido!
           �Que tanto me hab�is querido!
           �Madre de mi coraz�n!

           Perdonadme... �Qu� alborozo
           siento, aunque llorar me veis!                         420
           Seis a�os ha, m�s de seis,
           que tanta dicha no gozo.
           Mi desgracia contemplad,
           cuando como dicha cuento
           que mis penas un momento                               425
           aplaquen su intensidad.
           Pero este rayo que inunda
           en viva luz mi alma yerta,
           �dejar�is que se convierta
           en lobreguez m�s profunda?                             430
           Madre, madre, a quien adoro,
           el labio os pongo en el pie;
           mi aliento aqu� exhalar�,
           si no ced�is a mi lloro. (_P�strase._)

MARGARITA. Levanta, Isabel; enjuga                                435
           tus ojos; conf�a.... S�,
           cuanto dependa de m�....

ISABEL     Ya veis que en r�pida fuga
           el tiempo desaparece.
           Si pasan tres d�as, �tres!,                            440
           todo me sobra despu�s,
           toda esperanza fallece.
           Mi padre, por no faltar
           a la palabra tremenda,
           le rendir� por ofrenda                                 445
           mi albedr�o en el altar.
           Vuestras razones imprimen
           en su alma la persuasi�n:
           en m� toda reflexi�n
fuera desacato, crimen.                                           450
           Y yo, se�ora, lo veo:
           podr� llevarme a casar;
           pero en vez de preparar
           las galas del himeneo,
           que a tenerme se limite                                455
           una cruz y una mortaja;
           que esta gala y esta alhaja
           ser� lo que necesite.

MARGARITA. No, no, Isabel: cesa, cesa.
           Yo en tu defensa, me empe�o:                           460
           no ser� Azagra tu due�o.
           yo anular� la promesa.
           Me oir� tu padre, y tama�os
           horrores evitar�.
           Hoy madre tuya ser�                                    465
           quien no lo fu� tantos a�os.



           ESCENA VII


TERESA.--MARGARITA, ISABEL

TERESA.    Se�oras, don Rodrigo de Azagra pide licencia
           para visitaros.

MARGARITA. Hazle entrar. A buen tiempo llega.
(_Vase Teresa_.)

ISABEL.    Permitid que yo me retire.                             470

MARGARITA. Qu�date en la pieza inmediata, y escucha
           nuestra conversaci�n.

ISABEL.    �Qu� vais a decir?

MARGARITA. �yelo, y acabar�s de hacer justicia a tu
           madre. (_Vase Isabel_.)                                475



           ESCENA VIII


DON RODRIGO.--MARGARITA

MARGARITA. Ilustre don Rodrigo....

RODRIGO. Se�ora ... al fin nos vemos.

MARGARITA. Honrad mi estrado, ya que la prisa de
venir a mi casa no os ha dejado sosegar en la vuestra.

RODRIGO. Aqu� vengo a buscar el sosiego que necesito.             480
(_Si�ntase_.) �Qu� me dec�s de mi desde�osa?

MARGARITA. �Me permitir�is que hable con toda franqueza?

RODRIGO. Con franqueza pregunto yo.--Hablad.

MARGARITA. Mi esposo os prometi� la mano de su                    485
hija �nica; y, por �l, deb�is contar de seguro con ella.
Pero la delicadeza de vuestro amor y la elevaci�n de
vuestro car�cter �se satisfar�an con la posesi�n de una
mujer, cuyo cari�o no fuese vuestro?

RODRIGO. El coraz�n de Isabel no es ahora m�o, lo                 490
s�; pero Isabel es virtuosa, es el espejo de las doncellas:
cumplir� lo que jure, apreciar� mi rendida fe, y ser� el
ejemplo de las casadas.

MARGARITA. Mirad que su afecto a Marsilla no se ha
disminu�do.                                                       495

RODRIGO. No me inspira celos un rival, cuyo paradero
se ignora, cuya muerte, para m�, es indudable.

MARGARITA. �Y si volviese a�n? �Y si antes de
cumplirse el t�rmino, se presentara tan enamorado como
se fu�, y con aumentos muy considerables de hacienda?             500

RODRIGO. Mal har�a en aparecer ni antes ni despu�s de
mis bodas. �l prometi� renunciar a Isabel, si no se
enriquec�a en seis a�os; pero yo nada he prometido. Si
vuelve, uno de los dos ha de quedar solo junto a Isabel.
La mano que pretendemos ambos, no se compra con oro;              505
se gana con hierro, se paga con sangre.

MARGARITA. Vuestro lenguaje no es muy reverente
para usado en esta casa, y conmigo; pero os le perdono,
porque me perdon�is la pesadumbre que voy a daros.
Yo, noble don Rodrigo, yo que hasta hoy consent� en               510
vuestro enlace con Isabel, he visto por �ltimo que de �l
iba a resultar su desgracia y la vuestra. Tengo, pues, que
deciros, como cristiana y madre; tengo que suplicaros por
nuestro Se�or y nuestra Se�ora, que desist�is de un empe�o,
ya poco distante de la temeridad.                                 515

RODRIGO. Ese empe�o es p�blico, hace muchos a�os
que dura, y se ha convertido para m� en caso de honor.
Es imposible que yo desista. No os opong�is a lo que
no podr�is impedir.

MARGARITA. Aunque hab�is desairado mi ruego, tal                  520
vez no le desaire mi esposo.

RODRIGO. Mucho alcanz�is con �l: adora en vos, y lo
merec�is, porque ha quince a�os que os emple�is en la
caridad y la penitencia... Pero ... �os ha contado
ya la muerte de Roger de Lizana?                                  525

MARGARITA. �C�mo! �Roger ha muerto?

RODRIGO. S�, loco y mudo, seg�n estaba; desgraciadamente,
seg�n merec�a; y a los pies de don Pedro, como
era justo.

MARGARITA. �Cielos! Nada sab�a de ese infeliz.                    530

RODRIGO. Ese infeliz era muy delincuente, era el
corruptor de una dama ilustre.

MARGARITA. �Don Rodrigo!

RODRIGO. La esposa m�s respetable entre las de
Teruel.                                                           535

MARGARITA. Por compasi�n.... Si Roger ha
muerto....

RODRIGO. Casi espir� en mis brazos. Yo tend� sobre
el f�retro su cad�ver, yo hall� sobre su coraz�n unas
cartas....                                                        540

MARGARITA. �Cartas!

RODRIGO. De mujer ... cinco ... sin firma todas.
Pero yo os las presentar�, y vos me dir�is qui�n las ha
escrito.

MARGARITA. �Callad! �callad!                                      545

RODRIGO. Si no, acudir� a vuestro esposo: bien
conoce la letra.

MARGARITA. �No! �D�dmelas, rompedlas, quemadlas!

RODRIGO. Se os entregar�n; pero Isabel me ha de
entregar a m� su mano primero.                                    550

MARGARITA. �Oh!

RODRIGO. Dios os guarde, se�ora.

MARGARITA. Deteneos, o�dme.

RODRIGO. Para que os oiga, venid a verlas. (_Vase_.)

MARGARITA. Escuchad, escuchadme. (_Vase tras don                  555
Rodrigo_.)



          ESCENA IX


ISABEL, y despu�s TERESA

ISABEL. �Qu� es lo que o�? No lo he comprendido,
no quiero comprender ese misterio horrible: s�lo entiendo
que de infeliz he pasado a m�s. (_Sale Teresa_.)

TERESA. Se�ora, un joven extranjero ha llegado a                  560
casa pidiendo que se le dejara descansar un rato....

ISABEL. Rec�bele ... d�jame.

TERESA. Ya se le recibi�, y le han agasajado con vino
y magras; por se�as que nada de ello ha probado, como
si fuera moro o jud�o. Aparte de esto, es muy lindo               563
muchacho: he trabado conversaci�n con �l, y dice que
viene de Palestina.

ISABEL. �De Palestina?

TERESA. Yo me acord� al punto del pobre don Diego.
--Como os figur�is que debe estar por all�....                    570

ISABEL. S�. Ll�male pronto. (_Vase Teresa_.) �Virgen
piadosa! �Que haya sido sue�o lo que pienso que o�!
�Oh! Pensemos en el que viene de Palestina.

ZULIMA, en traje de noble aragon�s, TERESA.--ISABEL

ZULIMA.    El cielo os guarde.

ISABEL.                      Y a vos
           tambi�n.

ZULIMA (_aparte_.) Mi rival es �sta.

ISABEL.    Mejor pod�is descansar                                 575
           en esta sala que fuera.

TERESA.    Este mancebo, se�ora,
           viene de lejanas tierras,
           de Jerusalem, de Jope,
           de Bel�n ... y de Judea.                               580

ISABEL.    �Cierto?

ZULIMA.            S�.

TERESA.                Y ha conocido
           all� gente aragonesa.

ZULIMA.    Un caballero trat�
           de Teruel.

ISABEL.              �Cu�l? �Qui�n? �Qui�n era?
           �Su nombre?

ZULIMA.               Diego Marsilla.                             585

ISABEL.    �Os trajo Dios a mi puerta!--
           �D�nde le dej�is?

TERESA.                      Entonces,
           �era ya rico?

ZULIMA.                 Una herencia
           cuantiosa le dejaron
           all�.

ISABEL.         Pero �d�nde queda?                                590

ZULIMA.    Hace poco era cautivo
           del Rey moro de Valencia.

ISABEL.    �Cautivo! �Infeliz!

ZULIMA.                       No tanto.
           La esposa del Rey, la bella
           Zulima, le am�.

ISABEL.                   �Le am�?                                595

ZULIMA.    �S�! �mucho!

TERESA.                �Qu� desverg�enza!

ISABEL.    Y �qu�? � No viene por eso
           Marsilla donde le esperan?

TERESA.    �Se ha vuelto moro quiz�?

ZULIMA (_aparte_). Ya que padec�, padezca.                        600
           Finjamos.

ISABEL.             Hablad.

ZULIMA.                     No es f�cil
           resistir a una princesa
           hermosa y amante: al fin
           Marsilla, para con ella,
           era un miserable.

TERESA.                     Pero
           vamos, acabad....                                      605

ISABEL (_aparte_.)     Apenas
           vivo.

ZULIMA.        El Rey lleg� a saber
           lo que pasaba; la Reina
           pudo escapar, protegida
           por un bandido, cabeza                                 610
           de la cuadrilla temible
           que hoy anda por aqu� cerca;
           y Marsilla....

ISABEL.                   �Qu�?

ZULIMA.                         Rogad
           a Dios que le favorezca.

ISABEL.    �Ha muerto! �Jes�s, valedme!                           615
                 (_Desm�yase_.)

TERESA.    �Isabel! �Isabel!--�Buena
           la hab�is hecho!
ZULIMA. (_aparte_.)    Sabe amar
           esta cristiana de veras;
           yo s� m�s, yo s� vengarme.

TERESA.    �Se�ora!--�Paula! �Jimena!                             620
                 (_A Zulima_.)
           Buscad agua, llamad gente.

ZULIMA (_aparte_.)
           Salgamos.--Con esta nueva,
           se casar�. (_Vase_.)

TERESA.    �Dios confunda
           la boca ruin que nos cuenta
           noticia tan triste!... Pero                            625
           un pr�jimo que no prueba
           cerdo ni vino, �qu� puede
           dar de s�?

         (_Salen dos criadas que traen agua_.)

                     Pronto aqu�, lerdas.
           �D�nde estabais? A ver: dadme
           el agua.

ISABEL.           �Ay, Dios! �Ay, Teresa!                         630

MARGARITA.--ISABEL, TERESA, CRIADAS

MARGARITA. �Qu� sucede?

ISABEL.                �Ay, madre m�a!
           Ya no es posible que venga.
           Muri�.

MARGARITA.      �Qui�n? �Marsilla?

TERESA.                            �Qui�n
           ha de ser?

ISABEL.             Y ha muerto en pena
           de serme infiel.

TERESA.                      Una mora,                            635
           que dicen que no era fea,
           la esposa del reyezuelo
           valenciano, buena pieza
           sin duda, nos le quit�.

ISABEL.    �En esto paran aquellas                                640
           ilusiones de ventura
           que alimentaba risue�a!
           Conmigo nacieron �ay!...
           se van, y el alma se llevan.
           Ese infausto mensajero,                                645
           �d�nde est�? Dile que vuelva.

MARGARITA. S�: yo le preguntar�....

TERESA.    Pues como nos d� respuestas
           por el estilo.... Seguidme.

            (_Vanse Teresa y las criadas_.)



           ESCENA XII


MARGARITA, ISABEL

ISABEL.    �Qui�n figurarse pudiera                               650
           que me olvidara Marsilla?
           �Qu� sonrojo! �Qu� vileza!
           Pero �c�mo ha sido, c�mo
           fu� que no lo presintiera
           mi coraz�n? No es verdad:                              655
           imposible que lo sea.
           Se enga��, si lo crey�,
           la sultana de Valencia.
           Sol� por volar a m�,
           quebrantando sus cadenas,                              660
           dej� so�ar a la mora
           con esa falaz idea.
           M�rtir de mi amor ha sido,
           que desde el cielo en que reina,
           de su martirio me pide                                 665
           la debida recompensa.
           Yo se la dar� leal,
           yo defender� mi diestra:
           viuda del primer amor
           he de bajar a la huesa.                                670
           Llorar libremente quiero
           lo que de vivir me resta,
           sin que pueda hacer ninguno
           de mis l�grimas ofensa.
           No he de ser esposa yo                                 675
           de Azagra: primero muerta.

MARGARITA. �Tendr�s valor para?...

ISABEL.                            S�,
           mi desgracia me le presta.

MARGARITA. �Y si te manda tu padre?...

ISABEL.    Dir� que no.

MARGARITA.             Si te ruega....                            680

ISABEL.    No.

MARGARITA.    Si amenaza....

ISABEL.                       Mil veces
           no. Podr�n en hora buena,
           de los cabellos asida,
           arrastrarme hasta la iglesia,
           podr�n maltratar mi cuerpo,                            685
           cubrirle de �spera jerga,
           emparedarme en un claustro,
           donde lentamente muera:
           todo esto podr�n, s�; pero
           lograr que diga mi lengua                              690
           un s� perjuro, no.

MARGARITA.                   Bien,
           bien. Tu valor ... me consuela.

(_Aparte_. Nada oy�: m�s vale as�.
           La culpa, no la inocencia
           debe padecer.) Ten siempre                             695
           esa misma fortaleza,
           y no te dejes vencer,
           suceda lo que suceda.
           Matrimonio sin cari�o
           cr�menes tal vez engendra.                             700
           Yo s� de alguna infeliz
           que di� su mano violenta...
           y ... despu�s de larga lucha ...
           desminti� su vida honesta.
           Muchos a�os lleva ya                                   705
           de dolor y penitencia...
           Y al fin le toca morir,
           de oprobrio justo cubierta.

ISABEL.    �Ah, madre! �Qu� dije yo?
           Me olvid�, con esa nueva,                              710
           de otra desdicha tan grande
           que a mi desdicha supera.

MARGARITA. �No te cases, Isabel!

ISABEL.    S�, madre: mi vida es vuestra:
           d�rosla me manda Dios,                                 715
           lo manda naturaleza.

MARGARITA. �Hija!

ISABEL.          Por fortuna m�a,
           Marsilla al morir me deja
           el coraz�n sin amor
           y sin lugar donde prenda.                              720
           Por m�s fortuna, Marsilla
           de m� se olvid� en la ausencia,
           y puso en otra mujer
           el amor que me debiera.
           Por dicha mayor, Azagra                                725
           es de condici�n soberbia,
           celoso, iracundo: as�
           mis l�grimas y querellas
           insufribles le ser�n;
           querr� que yo las contenga;                            730
           no podr�, se irritar�,
           y me matar�.

MARGARITA.             �Me aterras,
           hija, me matas a m�!

ISABEL.    Tengo yo cartas que lea:
           puede encontr�rmelas.

MARGARITA.                       �Oh!                             735
           Si como las tuyas fueran
           otras....

ISABEL.             Y tengo un retrato
           en esta joya. (_Saca un relicario_.)
                       �Son �sas
           sus facciones? Pues sabed
           que, sin estudio ni regla,                             740
           de amor guiada la mano,
           al primer ensayo diestra,
           yo supe dar a ese rostro
           semejanza tan perfecta.
           Me sirvi� para suplir                                  745
           de Marsilla la presencia;
           no le necesito ya:
           m�s vale que no le vea.
           �Ah! dejadme que le bese
           una vez ... la �ltima es �sta.                         750
           Tomad. �Veis? el sacrificio
           consumo, y estoy serena,
           tranquila ... como la tumba.
           Imitad vos mi entereza,
           mi calma ... y no me dig�is                            755
           una palabra siquiera.
           De m� vuestra fama pende:
           la conservar�is ilesa.
           Yo me casar�: no importa,
           no importa lo que me cuesta. (_Vase_.)                 760



           ESCENA XIII


MARGARITA

MARGARITA. Y �debo yo consentir
           que la inocente Isabel,
           por mi ego�smo cruel,
           se ofrezca m�s que a morir?
           Pero �c�mo he de sufrir                                765
           que, perdida mi opini�n,
           me llame todo Arag�n
           hip�crita y vil mujer?
           Mala madre me hace ser
           mi buena reputaci�n.
           A todo me resignara
           con �nimo ya contrito,
           si al saberse mi delito,
           yo sola me deshonrara.
           Pero a mi esposo manchara                              775
           con ignominia mayor.
          �Hija infeliz en amor!
          �Hija desdichada m�a!
          Perdona la tiran�a
          de las leyes del honor.                                 780




          ACTO TERCERO


Retrete o gabinete de Isabel. Dos puertas.



          ESCENA PRIMERA


ISABEL, TERESA

Aparece ISABEL, ricamente vestida, sentada en un sill�n junto a una
mesa, sobre la cual hay un espejo de mano, hecho de metal. TERESA
est� acabando de adornar a su ama.

TERESA. �Qu� os parece el tocado? Nada, ni me
oye. Que os mir�is os digo; tomad el espejo. (_Se le da
a Isabel, que maquinalmente le toma, y deja caer la mano sin
mirarse_.) A esotra puerta. Miren �qu� trazas �stas de
novia!--Ved �qu� preciosa gargantilla voy a poneros!              5
(_Isabel inclina la cabeza_.) Pero alzad la cabeza, Isabel.
Si esto es amortajar a un difunto.

ISABEL. �Marsilla!

TERESA. (_Aparte._ Dios le haya perdonado.) Ea, se
concluy�. Bien est�is. Ello, s�, me hab�is hecho perder           10
la paciencia treinta veces.

ISABEL. �Madre m�a!

TERESA. Si ech�is menos a mi se�ora, ya os he dicho
que no est� en casa, porque para ella, la caridad es antes
que todo. El juez de este a�o, Domingo Celladas, ten�a            15
un hijo en tierra de infieles: Jaime, ya le conoc�is. Hoy,
sin que hubiese noticia de que viniera, se le han encontrado
en el camino de Valencia unos mercaderes, herido y
sin conocimiento. Por un rastro de sangre que iba a parar
a un hoyo, se ha comprendido que debieron echarle                 20
dentro; y se cree que hasta poder salir, habr� estado en
el hoyo quiz� m�s de un d�a, porque las heridas no son
recientes. Vuestra madre ha sido llamada para asistirle;
me ha encargado que os aderece; os he puesto hecha una
imagen; y ni siquiera he logrado que deis una mirada al           25
vestido, para ver si os gusta.

ISABEL. S�: es el �ltimo.

TERESA. �El dulc�simo nombre de Jes�s! No lo
quiera Dios, Isabelita de mi alma: no lo querr� Dios;
antes os har� tan dichosa como vos merec�is. Pero                 30
salid de ese abatimiento: mirad que ya van a venir
los convidados a la boda, y es menester no darles que decir.

ISABEL (_con sobresalto_). �Qu� hora es ya?

TERESA. No tardar�n en tocar a v�speras ah� al lado,
en San Pedro. Es la hora en que sali� de Teruel don               35
Diego; y hasta que pase, mi se�or no se considera libre
de su promesa.

ISABEL. S�, a esa hora, a esa hora misma parti� ...
para nunca volver. En este aposento, all�, delante de ese
balc�n estaba yo, llorando sobre mi labor, como ahora             40
sobre mis galas. Continuamente miraba a la calle por
donde hab�a de pasar, para verle; ahora no miro: no
le ver�. Por all� vino, dirigiendo el fogoso alaz�n, ense�ado
a parase bajo mis balcones. Por all� vino, vestida
la cota, la lanza en la mano, al brazo la banda, �ltimo don       45
de mi cari�o. �Hasta la dicha o hasta la tumba,� me dijo.
�Tuya o muerta,� le dije yo; y ca� sin aliento en el balc�n
mismo, tendidas las manos hacia la mitad de mi alma que
se ausentaba.--�Suya o muerta! Y voy a dar la mano a
Rodrigo. �Bien cumplo mi palabra!                                 50

TERESA. Hija m�a, desechad esas ideas. Yo �qu�
os he de decir para consolaros? Que os he visto nacer,
que hab�is jugado en mis brazos y en mis rodillas ... y
que diera yo porque recobraseis la paz del alma y fuerais
feliz �ay!, diera yo todos los d�as que me faltan que vivir,      55
menos uno para verlo.

ISABEL. �Feliz, Teresa? Con este vestido, �c�mo
he de ser feliz? �Pesa tanto, me ahoga tanto!...
Qu�tamele, Teresa. (_Levant�ndose_.)

TERESA. Se�ora, que viene don Rodrigo.                            60

ISABEL. �Don Rodrigo! Busca pronto a mi madre.
(_Vase Teresa_.)



          ESCENA II

DON RODRIGO.--ISABEL

RODRIGO.  Mis ojos por fin os ven
          a solas, �ngel hermoso.
          Siempre un amargo desd�n
          y un recato rigoroso                                    65
          me han privado de este bien.
          --Tr�mula est�is: ocupad
          la silla.

ISABEL.            �Ante mi se�or!

RODRIGO.  Esclavo dir�is mejor.
          Soberana es la beldad                                   70
          en el reino del amor.

ISABEL.   �Mentida soberan�a!

RODRIGO.  De mi rendimiento fiel,
          que dudarais no cre�a.
          �Si a conocer, Isabel,                                  75
          llegaseis el alma m�a!...

ISABEL.   �Para qu�? Se�as ha dado
          que indican su �ndole bella.

RODRIGO.  Mi destino desastrado
          s�lo mostrar me ha dejado                               80
          lo deforme que hay en ella.
          Un Azagra conoc�is
          orgulloso y vengativo;
          y otro por fin hallar�is
          que en vuestro rigor esquivo                            85
          figuraros no pod�is.
          El Azagra que os adora,
          el Azagra para vos,
          aun no le visteis, se�ora;
          y nos conviene a los dos                                90
          una explicaci�n ahora.

ISABEL.   Mis padres pueden mandar,
          yo tengo que obedecer,
          nada pretendo saber:
          hiciera bien en callar                                  95
          quien ha logrado vencer.

RODRIGO.  El vencedor, que aparece
          lleno ante vos de amargura,
          manifestaros ofrece
          que sabe lo que merece                                  100
          do�a Isabel de Segura.
          Os v�, y en vos admir�
          virtud y belleza rara:
          digno de vos me juzgu�,
          y uniros a m� jur�,                                     105
          costara lo que costara.
          Maldici�n m�s espantosa
          no pudo echarme jam�s
          una lengua venenosa
          que decir: no lograr�s                                  110
          hacer a Isabel tu esposa.
          Lidiar�, si es necesario,
          por ella con todo el orbe,
          clamaba yo de ordinario.
          �Infeliz el que me estorbe,                             115
          competidor o contrario!
          En mi celoso furor
          cabe hasta lo que denigre
          mi calidad y mi honor.
          Amo con ira de tigre ...                                120
          porque es muy grande mi amor.
          --No el vuestro, tan delicado,
          me pint�is para mi mengua:
          quiz� no lo haya expresado
          en seis a�os vuestra lengua,                            125
          sin que me lo hayan contado.
          Cuantas cartas escribi�
          Marsilla ausente, le�:
          �l su retrato no vi�,
          yo s�: junto a vos aqu�                                 130
          siempre tuve un guarda yo.
          Ha sido mi ocupaci�n
          observaros noche y d�a;
          y abandonaba a Monz�n
          siempre que lo permit�a                                 135
          la marcial obligaci�n.
          Vi�ndoos al balc�n sentada
          por las noches a la luna,
          mi fatiga era pagada:
          jam�s fu� mujer ninguna                                 140
          de amante m�s respetada.
          Para romper mis prisiones,
          para defectos hallaros,
          fueron mis indagaciones;
          y siempre para adoraros                                 145
          encontr� nuevas razones.
          Seducido el pensamiento
          de lisonjeros enga�os,
          un favorable momento
          espero hace ya seis a�os,                               150
          y aun llegado no lo cuento.
          Pero, por dicha, quiz�
          no deba estar muy distante.

ISABEL.   �Qu�! �Pens�is que cesar�
          mi pasi�n, muerto mi amante?                            155
          No, lo que yo vivir�.

RODRIGO.  Pues bien, amad, Isabel,
          y decidlo sin reparo;
          que con ese amor tan fiel,
          aunque a m� me cueste caro,                             160
          nunca me hallar�is cruel.
          Mas si ese afecto amoroso,
          cuya expresi�n no limito,
          mantener os es forzoso,
          yo, mi bien, yo necesito                                165
          el nombre de vuestro esposo.
          No m�s que el nombre, y concluyo
          de desear y pedir:
          todas mis dichas incluyo
          en la dicha de decir:                                   170
          �Me tienen por due�o suyo.�
          Separada habitaci�n,
          distinto lecho tendr�is....
          �Quer�is m�s separaci�n?
          Vos en Teruel vivir�is,                                 175
          yo en la corte de Arag�n.
          �Tem�is que la soledad
          bajo mi techo os consuma?
          Vuestros padres os llevad
          con vos: mudar�is en suma                               180
          de casa y de vecindad.
          Nunca sin vuestra licencia
          ver� esos divinos ojos....
          �Ay! d�dmela con frecuencia.
          Si os oprimen los enojos,                               185
          hablad, y mi diligencia
          ya un fest�n, ya una batida,
          ya un torneo dispondr�.
          Si llor�is.... �Prenda querida!
          cuando llor�is, �qu� os dir�                            190
          quien no ha llorado en su vida?
          M�seros ambos, hacer
          con la indulgencia podemos
          menor nuestro padecer.
          Ahora, aunque nos casemos,                              195
          �me podr�is aborrecer?

ISABEL.   �Don Rodrigo! �Don Rodrigo! (_Sollozando_.)

RODRIGO.  �Llor�is? �Es porque me muestro
          digno de ser vuestro amigo?
          �No sufr� del odio vuestro                              200
          bastante el duro castigo?

ISABEL.   �Oh! no, no: mi coraz�n
          palpitar de odio no sabe.

RODRIGO.  Ni al mirar vuestra aflicci�n
          hay fuerza en m� que no acabe                           205
          rindi�ndose a discreci�n.
          Es ya el caso de manera
          que el infausto desposorio
          viene a ser obligatorio
          para ambos: lo dem�s fuera                              210
          dar esc�ndalo notorio.
          Pero el amor que os consagro,
          se ha vuelto a vos tan propicio,
          que si Dios en su alto juicio
          quiere obrar hoy un milagro ...                         215
          contad con un sacrificio.
          Ayer, si resucitara
          mi aciago rival Marsilla,
          sin compasi�n le matara,
          y sin limpiar la cuchilla,                              220
          corriera con vos al ara.
          Hoy, resucitado o no,
          si antes que me deis el s�,
          viene ... que triunfe de m�.

ISABEL.   �Vos, s� que triunf�is as�                              225
          de esta d�bil mujer!

(_El llanto le ahoga la voz por unos instantes; luego, al ver a
don Pedro y a los que le acompa�an, se contiene, exclamando_:)

                                 �Oh!



ESCENA III


DON PEDRO, DON MART�N, DAMAS, CABALLEROS, PAJES.--
ISABEL, DON RODRIGO. Despu�s, TERESA

PEDRO. Hijos, el sacerdote que ha de bendecir vuestra
uni�n, ya nos est� esperando en la iglesia. Tanto mis
deudos como los de Azagra me instan a que apresure la
ceremonia; pero aun no ha fenecido el plazo que otorgu�           230
a don Diego. Al toque de v�speras de un domingo, sali�
de su patria el malogrado joven, seis a�os y siete d�as
hace: hasta que suene aquella se�al en mi o�do, no tengo
libertad para disponer de mi hija. (_A don Mart�n._)
Porque ve�is de qu� modo cumplo mi promesa, os he rogado          235
que vinierais aqu�.

MART�N. �In�til escrupulosidad! No os deteng�is.
No romper� mi hijo el seno de la tierra para reconveniros.

ISABEL (_aparte_). �Infeliz!

PEDRO. Fiel a lo que jur� me ver� desde el t�mulo,                240
cual me hallar�a viviendo. (_Sale Teresa_.)

RODRIGO. Isabel desear� la compa��a de su madre:
pudi�ramos pasar por casa del Juez....

TERESA. Ahora empezaba el herido a volver en su
conocimiento. Si antes de v�speras no se halla mi se�ora          245
en la iglesia, es se�al de que no puede asistir a los desposorios:
esto me ha dicho.

PEDRO. La esperaremos en el templo. (_A don Mart�n._)
Si la pesadumbre os permite acompa�arnos, venid....

MART�N. Excusadme el presenciar un acto que debe                  250
serme tan doloroso.

PEDRO. Estad seguro de que mientras no oig�is las
campanas, no habr� dado su mano Isabel. Estos
caballeros podr�n atestiguar que se esper� hasta el cabal
vencimiento del plazo. Marchemos.                                 255

ISABEL (_aparte_). �Morada de mi pasado bien, adi�s
para siempre!

(_Vanse todos, menos don Mart�n._)



ESCENA IV


DON MART�N

MART�N. Con pena, con celos veo yo a Isabel dirigirse
al altar. Hubo un tiempo en que la tuve por hija: hoy
me quitan su filial cari�o, y ella consiente. Pero �qu�           260
falta hace al m�sero cad�ver de mi hijo la constancia de la
que �l am�? Si su sombra necesita l�grimas, bien se
puede satisfacer con las m�as.



ESCENA V


ADEL.--DON MART�N

ADEL. Cristiano, busco a Mart�n Marsilla, que est�
aqu�, seg�n se me dice. �Eres t�?                                 265

MART�N. Yo soy.

ADEL. �Qu� sabes de tu hijo?

MART�N. �Moro!... su muerte.

ADEL. Esa noticia ... �qui�n la ha tra�do?

MART�N. Un joven forastero.                                       270

ADEL. �En d�nde para?

MART�N. Apenas se detuvo en Teruel: yo no pude
verle.

ADEL. �Qu� ha pasado con Jaime Celladas?

MART�N. Le han herido gravemente al llegar a la villa:            275
en su lecho yace todav�a sin voz ni conocimiento.

ADEL. Luego �t� nada sabes?

MART�N. �Qu� vas a decirme?

ADEL. Acabo de averiguar que, disfrazada con traje
de hombre, ha entrado en Teruel Zulima, la esposa del             280
Amir de Valencia.

MART�N. �La que fu� causa de la p�rdida de mi hijo?

ADEL. �l la desde��, y ella se ha vengado mintiendo.

MART�N. �Mintiendo?

ADEL. �Anciano! Bendice al Se�or: aun eres padre.                 285

MART�N. �Dios poderoso!

ADEL. Tu hijo libr� de un asesinato p�rfido al Amir
de Valencia, y el Amir le ha colmado de riquezas y honores.
Herido en un combate, no se le permiti� caminar hasta reponerse.
Jaime ven�a delante para anunciar su vuelta.                      290
S�gueme, y no parar� hasta poner a Marsilla en tus brazos.
(_Vase_.)

MART�N (_alzando las manos al cielo, arrebatado de
j�bilo_). �Se�or! �Se�or!



ESCENA VI


MARGARITA.--DON MART�N

MARGARITA (_dentro_). �Isabel! �Isabel! (_Sale y repara
en don Mart�n, que se retiraba con Adel_.) Don Mart�n....         295

MART�N (_deteni�ndose_). Margarita, sabedlo....

MARGARITA. Sabedlo el primero. Jaime Celladas....

MART�N. Ese moro que veis....

MARGARITA. Ha vuelto en s�.

MART�N. Viene de Valencia.                                        300

MARGARITA. Jaime tambi�n.

MART�N. Vive mi hijo.

MARGARITA. Lo ha dicho Jaime. Corred, impedid
ese casamiento. (_�yese el toque de v�speras_.)

MART�N. �Ah! ya es tarde.                                         305

MARGARITA. �Dios ha rechazado mi sacrificio!

MART�N. �Hijo infeliz!

MARGARITA. �Hija de mis entra�as! (_Vase_.)

Bosque inmediato a Teruel

MARSILLA, atado a un �rbol

           Infames bandoleros,
           que me hab�is a traici�n acometido,                    310
           venid y ensangrentad vuestros aceros:
           la muerte ya por compasi�n os pido.
           --Nadie llega, de nadie soy o�do;
           vuelve el eco mis voces, y parece
           que goza en mi dolor y me escarnece.                   315
           Me adelant� a la escolta que tra�a:
           su lento caminar me consum�a.
           Yo vengo con amor, ellos con oro.
           --Enemigos villanos,
           los ricos dones del monarca moro                       320
           no como yo dar�n en vuestras manos:
           tienen quien los defienda.
           Pero las horas pasan, huye el d�a.
           �Qu� vas a imaginar, Isabel m�a?
           �Qu� pensar�s, idolatrada prenda,                      325
           si esperando abrazar al triste Diego,
           corrido el plazo ves, y yo no llego?
           Mas por Jaime avisados
           en mi casa estar�n: pronto, azorados
           con mi tardanza.... S�, ya se aproxima                 330
           gente. �Qui�n es?

ZULIMA.                     Yo soy.

MARSILLA.                      �Cielos! �Zulima!
          �T� aqu�! (_Aparte._ �Presagio horrendo!)

ZULIMA.   Vecinos de Teruel vienen corriendo
          a quienes m�s que a m� toca librarte:
          yo s�lo en esta parte                                   335
          me debo detener mientras te digo
          que Isabel es mujer de don Rodrigo.

MARSILLA. �Gran Dios!--Mas no: me enga�as,
            impostora.

ZULIMA.   Za�n, que llega de Teruel ahora,
          Za�n ha visto dar aquella mano                          340
          tan ansiada por ti.

MARSILLA.                     Finges en vano.
          T� ignoras que mi pr�xima llegada
          previno un mensajero.

ZULIMA.   T� no sabes que un tirador certero
          supo dejar tu previsi�n burlada,                        345
          sali�ndole al camino al mensajero.
          Yo habl� con Isabel, yo de tu muerte
          la noticia le d�, y a los bandidos
          encargu� que tu viaje detuvieran.
          Yo, celebradas de Isabel las bodas,                     350
          te las vengo a anunciar.

MARSILLA.                      �Con que es ya tarde?

ZULIMA.   M�rame, bien, y d�dalo si puedes.
          In�tiles mercedes
          el Rey te prodig�: m�s he podido,
          pr�fuga yo, que mi real marido.                         355
          Yo mi amor te ofrec�, bienes y honores,
          y te inmol� mi fe y el ser que tengo;
          t� preferiste ingrato mis rencores:
          me ofendiste cruel, cruel me vengo.
          Adi�s: en mi partida                                    360
          te dejo por ahora con la vida,
          mientras padeces en el duro potro
          de ver a tu Isabel en brazos de otro. (_Vase_.)



ESCENA IX


MARSILLA

MARSILLA. Monstruo, por cuya voz ruge el abismo,
          vuelve y di que es enga�o                               365
          todo lo que te o�. (_Forceja para desatarse_.)
                              Lazos crueles,
          �c�mo me resist�s? �Ligan cordeles
          al que hierros quebr�! �No soy el mismo?
          �Ah! no. Mujer fatal, cortos instantes
          me quedan que vivir, si no has mentido;                 370
          pero �permita Dios que mueras antes!



ESCENA X


ADEL, pasando por una altura.--MARSILLA

ADEL.     Rumor aqu� he sentido.
          Atraviesan el valle bandoleros
          con Zulima a caballo.
          Yo, cueste lo que cueste,                               375
          la tengo de prender: voy a ver si hallo
          cerca mis compa�eros.

MARSILLA. �Qui�n va?

ADEL.               Marsilla es �ste. (_A voces_.)
          Aqu�! �Por este lado, caballeros! (_Vase_.)



ESCENA XI


DON MART�N, CABALLEROS, CRIADOS.--MARSILLA

MART�N (_dentro_.) �l es.

MARSILLA.                     �Mi padre!

VOCES (_dentro_.)                  �l es.

MARSILLA.                                       �Padre!

MART�N (_dentro_.)                     �Hijo m�o�                 380
          Subid, corred, volad: libradle pronto.

           (_Salen caballeros y criados_.)
MARSILLA. Desatadme, decidme....

               (_Desatan a Marsilla_.)

MART�N (_saliendo_.)                  �Hijo querido!

MARSILLA. �Padre!

MART�N.           Por fin te hall�.

MARSILLA.                        Decid.... �Es tarde?
          Yo quisiera dudar ... mi mal �es cierto?

MART�N.   Resp�ndante las l�grimas que vierto.                    385
          Hijo del alma, a quien su hierro ardiente
          la desgracia al nacer marc� en la frente,
          tu triste padre, que por verte vive,
          con dolor en sus brazos te recibe.
          �Qui�n tu llegada ha retardado?

MARSILLA.                               El cielo ...              390
          el inferno ... no s� ... facinerosos ...
          una mujer ... dejadme.

MART�N.                         �La Sultana?
          �Esos bandidos que cobardes huyen
          de los guerreros que conmigo traje?--
          �Te han herido?

MARSILLA.                �Ojal�!

MART�N                           �Te han despojado?               395

MARSILLA. Nada he perdido: la esperanza s�lo.

MART�N.   �Suerte cruel! Cuando el fatal sonido
          de la campana t�rmino pon�a....

MARSILLA. �Esa tigre anunci� la muerte m�a!

MART�N.   �Lo sabes?

MARSILLA.           De ella.

MART�N.                     �Horror! Entonces era                 400
          cuando Jaime, el sentido recobrando,
          la traidora noticia desment�a.
          Corro al templo a saber.... Miro, enmudezco....
          �Eran esposos ya! Tu bien perdiste...
          Dios lo ha querido as�... Pero aun te quedan            405
          padres que lloren tu destino triste.

MARSILLA. El ajeno dolor no quita el m�o.
          �Con qu� llen�is el h�rrido vac�o
          que el alma siente, de su bien privada?
          �Padre! sin Isabel, para Marsilla                       410
          no hay en el mundo nada.
          Por eso en mi doliente desvar�o
          sed b�rbara de sangre me devora.
          Verterla a r�os para hartarme quiero,
          y cuando m�s que derramar no tenga,                     415
          la de mis venas soltar� mi acero.

MART�N.   Hijo, modera ese furor.

MARSILLA.                         �Qui�n osa
          hijo llamarme ya? �Fuera ese nombre!
          La desventura quiebra
          los v�nculos del hombre con el hombre,                  420
          y con la vida y la virtud. Ahora,
          que tiemble mi rival, tiemble la mora.
          Breve ser� su victorioso alarde:
          para acabar con ambos aun no es tarde.

MART�N.   �Desgraciado! �qu� intentas?

MARSILLA.                              Con el crimen              423
          el crimen castigar. Una serpiente
          se me enreda en los pies: mi pie destroce
          su garganta infernal. Un enemigo
          me aparta de Isabel: desaparezca.

MART�N.   Hijo....

MARSILLA.           Perecer�

MART�N.                      No....

MARSILLA.                          �Maldecido                     430
          mi nombre sea, si la sangre odiosa
          de mi rival no vierto!

MART�N.                         Es poderoso....

MARSILLA. Marsilla soy.

MART�N.                 Mil deudos le acompa�an....

MARSILLA. Mi furia a m�.

MART�N.                  Mer�zcate respeto
          ese lazo....

MARSILLA.               Es sacr�lego, es aleve.                   435

MART�N.   En presencia de Dios formado ha sido.

MARSILLA. Con mi presencia queda destru�do.




          ACTO CUATRO


Habitaci�n de Isabel en la casa de don Rodrigo. Dos puertas a la
izquierda del espectador, una en el fondo, y una ventana sin reja a la
derecha.



          ESCENA PRIMERA


DON PEDRO, DON MART�N

PEDRO.    Ya ces� la vocer�a.

MART�N.   Ya se tranquiliza el pueblo.
          Za�n en la c�rcel queda
          con los dem�s bandoleros.

PEDRO.    Milagro ha sido salvarlos                               5
          mayor que lo fu� prenderlos.

MART�N.   Y no los prenden quiz�,
          si no acuden tan a tiempo
          los moros que de Valencia
          con los regalos vinieron                                10
          de su Rey para mi hijo.
          �Regalos ya sin provecho!
          �Castigue Dios a quien tiene
          la culpa!

PEDRO.                   �Oh! lo har�.--Primero
          que vayamos esta noche                                  15
          los dos al Ayuntamiento,
          donde ya deben hallarse
          juntos el Juez y mi yerno,
          �tendr�is, don Mart�n, a bien
          que los dos conferenciemos                              20
          un rato?

MART�N.            Hablad.

PEDRO.                     Aqu� est�
          Zulima.

MART�N.            Bien me dijeron
          los moros.

PEDRO.              En esta calle
          arremeti� con los presos
          un tropel de gente; y ella,                             25
          puesta en libertad en medio
          del tumulto, se arroj�
          por estas puertas adentro.

MART�N.   Confesad que don Rodrigo
          la salv�.

PEDRO.             No lo confieso ...                             30
          porque no lo v�.

MART�N                     Yo, en suma,
          no dir� que fu� mal hecho:
          �l debe a la mora estar
          agradecido en extremo:
          por ella logra la mano                                  35
          de Isabel.

PEDRO.               Resentimiento
          justo mostr�is; pero yo,
          que he sido enemigo vuestro,
          necesito de vos hoy.

MART�N.   Aqu� me ten�is, don Pedro.                              40

PEDRO.    Sois quien sois.--Esa mujer
          nos pone en terrible aprieto.
          Ya veis, los moros reclaman
          su entrega con mucho empe�o.

MART�N.   Y mientras el Juez resuelve,                            45
          cercada se ve por ellos
          esta casa.

PEDRO.    Y bien, �quisierais
          que entre vos y yo de un riesgo
          libr�ramos a Teruel?

MART�N.   Crimen fuera no quererlo.                               50

PEDRO.    Si en la junta de la villa
          negamos, como debemos,
          la entrega de la Sultana,
          va a ser enemigo nuestro
          el Rey de Valencia, y puede                             55
          grav�simo da�o hacernos.

MART�N.   Y el que recibimos ambos
          de su mujer, �es peque�o?

PEDRO.    Pero es mujer, y nosotros
          cristianos y caballeros.                                60

MART�N.   Proseguid.

PEDRO.    El compromiso
          queda evitado, si hacemos
          que huya en el instante.

MART�N.   Hag�moslo.
          --P�gueme Dios el esfuerzo
          que me cuesta no vengarme.                              65
          Disponed.

PEDRO.             Con un pretexto
          llevad los moros de aqu�:
          de vos har�n caso.

MART�N.                     Creo
          que s�.

PEDRO.            Lo dem�s es f�cil.
          Puesta ya en salvo, diremos                             70
          que ella huy� por s�.

MART�N.                        Voy pues,
          y ya que la mano tiendo
          al uno de los autores
          de mi desventura, quiero
          d�rsela tambi�n al otro.                                75
          Decid al dichoso due�o
          de esta casa y de Isabel,
          que mire en estos momentos
          por su vida: que mi hijo
          va, loco de sentimiento                                 80
          y de furor, en su busca
          por Teruel; y, �vive el cielo
          que, doliente como est�,
          valor le sobra al mancebo
          para vengar!... Perdonadme.                             85
          Adi�s. Voy a complaceros,
          y a buscarle y conducirle
          esta noche misma lejos
          de unos lugares en donde
          vivimos los dos muriendo.                               90

(_Vase por la puerta de la izquierda, m�s cercana al proscenio_.)

PEDRO.     Id con Dios.--�Padre infeliz!
           �Y nosotros? Me estremezco
           al pensar en Isabel,
           cuando de todo el suceso
           llegue a enterarse.



           ESCENA II


TERESA.--DON PEDRO

TERESA (_dentro_).      �Favor,                                   95
           que me vienen persiguiendo! (_Sale._)

PEDRO.     �Teresa! �Qu� hay? �Qui�n te sigue?

TERESA.    Las �nimas del infierno...
           Las del purgatorio... No
           s� cu�les; pero las veo,                               100
           las oigo....

PEDRO.                  Mas �qu� sucede?

TERESA.    �Ay! Muerta de susto vengo.
           �Ay!--Isabel me ha enviado
           por mi se�ora corriendo,
           que volvi�, no s� por qu�,                             105
           a la casa del enfermo;
           y antes de llegar, he visto
           en un callej�n estrecho,
           junto a la ermita ca�da...
           �Jes�s! convulsa me vuelvo                             110
           a casa.

PEDRO.           �Qu� viste? Di.

TERESA.    Una fantasma, un espectro
           todo parecido, todo,
           al pobrecito don Diego.

PEDRO.     Calla: no te oiga Isabel.                              115
           Guarda con ella silencio.--
           Marsilla ha venido, y ella
           no lo sabe.

TERESA.                 Pero, �es cierto
           que vive?

PEDRO.              �No ha de ser?

TERESA.                            �Ay!
           Pues otra desgracia temo.                              120

PEDRO.     �Cu�l?

TERESA.          No lo asegurar�,
           por si es aprensi�n del miedo;
           sin embargo, yo cre�
           ver que se llevaba el muerto
           asido del brazo al novio.                              125

PEDRO.     �Qu� dices?

TERESA.               Aun traigo el eco
           de su voz en los o�dos.
           Con alarido tremendo
           dec�a: �Vas a morir,
           has de morir.�--�Lo veremos,�                          130
           replicaba don Rodrigo;
           y echando votos y retos,
           iban los dos como rayos
           camino del cementerio.
           Yo, se�or, ya les rec�                                 135
           la salve y el padre nuestro
           en lat�n.

PEDRO.              Se han encontrado,
           y van a tener un duelo.
           Esto es antes.



ESCENA III


ISABEL, por la segunda puerta del lado izquierdo.--DON PEDRO,
TERESA

ISABEL.          � Padre!

PEDRO.                    Agu�rdame
           aqu�: pronto volveremos                                140
           tu madre, tu esposo y yo.
           Venid, Teresa. (_Vase los dos._)

ISABEL.                   �Qu� es esto?
           �Mi padre me deja sola,
           cuando con tanto secreto
           un moro me quiere hablar!                              145
           Sin duda est�n sucediendo
           cosas extra�as aqu�.

         (_Ac�rcase a la segunda puerta._)

           Llegad. Al mirarle, tiemblo.



ESCENA IV


ADEL.--ISABEL

ADEL.      Cristiana, brillante honor
           de las damas de tu ley,                                150
           yo imploro, en nombre del Rey
           de Valencia, tu favor.

ISABEL.    �Mi favor?

ADEL.                Tendr�s noticia
           de que sali� de su corte
           Zulima, su infiel consorte,                            155
           huyendo de su justicia.

ISABEL.    S�.

ADEL.         Mi se�or decret�
           con rectitud musulmana
           castigar a la Sultana,
           ya que a Marsilla premi�.                              160

ISABEL.    �Premiar!... �Ignoras, cruel,
           que le di� muerte sa�uda?

ADEL.      T� no le has visto, sin duda,
           entrar como yo en Teruel.

ISABEL.    �Marsilla en Teruel!

ADEL.                          S�.

ISABEL.                           Mira                            165
           si te enga�as.

ADEL.                     Mal pudiera.
           Inf�rmate de cualquiera,
           y m�tenme, si es mentira.

ISABEL.    No es posible.--�Ah! �s�! que siendo
           mal, no es imposible nada.                             170

ADEL.      Por la villa alborotada
           tu nombre va repitiendo.

ISABEL.    �Eterno Dios! �Qu� infelices
           nacimos!--�Cu�ndo ha llegado?
           �C�mo es que me lo han callado?                        175
           --Y t�, �por qu� me lo dices?

ADEL.      Porque est�s, a mi entender,
           en grave riesgo quiz�.

ISABEL.    Perdido Marsilla, ya
           �qu� bien tengo que perder?                            180

ADEL.      Con viva l�stima escucho
           tus ansias de amor extremas;
           pero aunque t� nada temas,
           yo debo decirte mucho.
           Marsilla a mi Rey salv�                                185
           de unos conjurados moros,
           y el Rey verti� sus tesoros
           en �l, y aqu� le envi�.
           El despreci� la liviana
           inclinaci�n de la infiel....                           190

ISABEL.    �Oh! �S�!

ADEL.              Y airada con �l
           vino, y se veng� villana
           contando su falso fin.

ISABEL.    �Ella!

ADEL.           Con una gavilla
           de bandidos, a Marsilla                                195
           detuvo, ya en el conf�n
           de Teruel, donde veloces
           corriendo en tropel armado,
           le hallamos a un tronco atado,
           socorro pidiendo a voces.                              200

ISABEL.    Calla, moro: no m�s.

ADEL.                         Pasa
           m�s, y es bien que te aperciba.
           --La Sultana fugitiva
           se ha refugiado en tu casa:
           en �sta.

ISABEL.           �Aqu� mi rival!                                 205

ADEL.      Tu esposo la libert�.

ISABEL.    �Ella donde habito yo!

ADEL.      Gu�rdate de su pu�al.
           Por celos all� en Valencia
           matar a Marsilla quiso.                                210

ISABEL.    A tiempo llega el aviso.

ADEL.      Confirma t� la sentencia
           que justo lanz� el Amir.
           Por esa mujer malvada
           para siempre separada                                  215
           de Marsilla has de vivir.
           Ella te arrastra al odioso
           t�lamo de don Rodrigo.
           Env�ala t� conmigo
           al que le apresta su esposo,                           220
           pena digna del ultraje
           que siente.

ISABEL.                S�, moro; salga
           pronto de aqu�, no le valga
           el fuero del hospedaje.
           Como perseguida fiera                                  225
           entr� en mi casa: pues bien,
           al cazador se la den,
           que la mate donde quiera.
           Mostrarse de pecho blando
           con ella, fuera rayar                                  230
           en loca: voy a mandar
           que la traigan arrastrando.
           Sean de mi furia jueces
           cuantas pierdan lo que pierdo.
           �Jes�s! Cuando yo recuerdo                             235
           que hoy pude... �Jes�s mil veces!
           No le ha de valer el llanto,
           ni el ser mujer, ni ser bella,
           ni reina. �Si soy por ella
           tan infeliz! �tanto, tanto!...                         240
           Dime, pues, di: tu se�or,
           �qu� suplicio le impondr�?

ADEL.      Una hoguera acabar�
           con su delincuente amor.

ISABEL.    �Su amor! �Amor desastrado!                            245
           Pero es amor....

ADEL.                       Y �es bastante
           esa raz�n?...

ISABEL.                 �Es mi amante
           tan digno de ser amado!
           Le vi�, le debi� querer
           en vi�ndole.--�Y yo, que hac�a                         250
           tanto que no le ve�a ...
           y ya no le puedo ver!
           --Moro, la v�ctima niego
           que me vienes a pedir:
           quiero yo darle a sufrir                               255
           castigo mayor que el fuego:
           ella con feroz encono
           mi coraz�n desgarr� ...
           me asesina el alma ... yo
           la defiendo, la perdono. (_Vase._)                     260



           ESCENA V


ADEL

           He perdido la ocasi�n.
           Suele tener esta gente
           acciones, que de un creyente
           propias en justicia son.
           Yo dejara con placer                                   265
           este empe�o abandonado;
           pero el Amir lo ha mandado,
           y es forzoso obedecer. (_Vase._)



           ESCENA VI


MARSILLA, por la ventana

           Jard�n ... una ventana ... y ella luego.
           Jard�n abierto hall� y hall� ventana;                  270
           mas �d�nde est� Isabel?--Dios de clemencia,
           detened mi raz�n, que se me escapa;
           detenedme la vida, que parece
           que de luchar con el dolor se cansa.
           Siete d�as hace hoy, �qu� venturoso                    275
           era en aquel sal�n! Sangre manaba
           de mi herida, es verdad; pero agolpados
           al rededor de mi lujosa cama,
           la tierna historia de mi amor o�an
           los guerreros, el pueblo y el Monarca,                 280
           y entre piadoso llanto y bendiciones
           �tuya ser� Isabel� juntos clamaban
           s�bditos y se�or. Hoy no me ofende
           mi herida, rayos en mi diestra lanza
           el damasquino acero... No le traigo...                 285
           �Y hace un momento que con dos me hallaba!
           --Salvo en Teruel y vencedor, �qu� angustia
           viene a ser �sta que me rinde el alma,
           cuando, acabada la cruel ausencia,
           voy a ver a Isabel?



ESCENA VII


ISABEL.--MARSILLA

ISABEL.                       Por fin se encarga                  290
           mi madre de Zulima.

MARSILLA.                     �Cielo santo!

ISABEL.    �Gran Dios!

MARSILLA.            �No es ella?

ISABEL.                        ��l es!

MARSILLA.                            �Prenda adorada!

ISABEL.    �Marsilla!

MARSILLA.            �Gloria m�a!

ISABEL.                          �C�mo �ay! c�mo
           te atreves a poner aqu� la planta?
           Si te han visto llegar... �A qu� has venido?           295

MARSILLA.  Por Dios ... que lo olvid�. Pero �no basta,
           para que hacia Isabel vuele Marsilla,
           querer, deber, necesitar mirarla?
           �Oh! �qu� hermosa a mis ojos te presentas!
           Nunca te v� tan bella, tan galana...                   300
           Y un pesar sin embargo indefinible
           me inspiran esas joyas, esas galas.
           Arr�jalas, mi bien; lana modesta,
           c�ndida flor, en mi jard�n criada,
           vuelvan a ser tu virginal adorno:                      305
           mi amor se asusta de riqueza tanta.

ISABEL. (_Aparte._ �Delira el infeliz! Sufrir no puedo
           su dolorida, at�nita mirada.)
           �No entiendes lo que indica el atav�o,
           que no puedes mirar sin repugnancia?                   310
           Nuestra separaci�n.

MARSILLA.                     �Poder del cielo!
           S�. �Funesta verdad!

ISABEL.                         Estoy casada.

MARSILLA.  Ya lo s�. Llegu� tarde. V� la dicha,
           tend� las manos, y vol� al tocarla.

ISABEL.    Me enga�aron: tu muerte supusieron                     315
           Y tu infidelidad.

MARSILLA.                   �Horrible infamia!

ISABEL.    Yo la muerte cre�.

MARSILLA.                    Si t� viv�as,
           y tu vida y la m�a son entrambas
           una sola, no m�s, la que me alienta,
           �c�mo de ti sin ti se separara?                        320
           Juntos aqu� nos desterr� la mano
           que gozo y pena distribuye sabia:
           juntos al fin de la mortal carrera
           nos toca ver la celestial morada.

ISABEL.    �Oh! �si me oyera Dios!...

MARSILLA.                            Isabel, mira,                325
           yo no vengo a dar quejas: fueran vanas.
           Yo no vengo a decirte que debiera
           prometerme de ti mayor constancia,
           cumplimiento mejor del tierno voto
           que invocando a la Madre inmaculada,                   330
           me hiciste amante la postrera noche
           que me apart� de tu balc�n el alba.
           �Para ti (sollozando me dec�as),
           o si no, para Dios.�--�Dulce palabra,
           consoladora fiel de mis pesares                        335
           en los ardientes p�ramos del Asia
           y en mi cautividad! Hoy ni eres m�a,
           ni esposa del Se�or. Di, pues, declara
           (esto quiero saber) de qu� ha nacido
           el prodigio infeliz de tu mudanza.                     340
           Causa debe tener.

ISABEL.                     La tiene.

MARSILLA.                            Grande.

ISABEL.    Poderosa, invencible: no se casa
           quien amaba cual yo, sino cediendo
           a la fuerza mayor en fuerza humana.

MARSILLA.  D�melo pronto, pues, dilo.

ISABEL.                               Imposible.                  345
           No has de saberlo.

MARSILLA.                     S�.

ISABEL.                           No.

MARSILLA.                            Todo.

ISABEL.                                    Nada.
           Pero t� en mi lugar tambi�n el cuello
           d�cil a la coyunda sujetaras.

MARSILLA.  Yo no, Isabel, yo no. Marsilla supo
           despreciar una mano soberana                           350
           y la muerte arrostrar por quien ahora
           la suya vende y el porqu� le calla.

ISABEL.    (_Aparte._ �Madre, madre!)

MARSILLA.                                 Responde.

ISABEL.                        (_Aparte._ �Qu� le digo?)
           Tendr� que confesar ... que soy culpada.
           �C�mo no lo he de ser? Me ves ajena.                   355
           Perd�name... Cast�game por falsa,
                  (_Llora._)

           m�tame, si es tu gusto... Aqu� me tienes
           para el golpe mortal arrodillada.

MARSILLA.  �dolo m�o, no; yo s� que debo
           poner mis labios en tus huellas. Alza.                 360
           No es de arrepentimiento el lloro triste
           que esos luceros f�lgidos empa�a;
           ese llanto es de amor, yo lo conozco,
           de amor constante, sin doblez, sin tacha,
           ferviente, abrasador, igual al m�o.                    365
           �No es verdad, Isabel? D�melo franca:
           va mi vida en o�rtelo.

ISABEL.                           �Prometes
           obedecer a tu Isabel?

MARSILLA.                       �Ingrata!
           �Cu�ndo me rebel� contra tu gusto?
           Mi voluntad, �no es tuya? Dispon, habla.               370

ISABEL.    J�ralo.

MARSILLA.         S�.

ISABEL.              Pues bien... Yo te amo.--Vete.

MARSILLA.  �Cruel! �Temiste que ventura tanta
           me matase a tus pies, si su dulzura
           con venenosa hiel no iba mezclada?
           �C�mo esas dos ideas enemigas                          375
           de destierro y de amor hiciste hermanas?

ISABEL.    Ya lo ves, no soy m�a; soy de un hombre
           que me hace de su honor depositaria,
           y debo serle fiel. Nuestros amores
           mantuvo la virtud libres de mancha:                    380
           su pureza de armi�o conservemos.--
           Aqu� hay espinas, en el cielo palmas.
           Tuyo es mi amor y lo ser�: tu imagen
           siempre en el pecho llevar� grabada,
           y all� la adorar�: yo lo prometo,                      385
           yo lo juro; mas huye sin tardanza.
           Lib�rtame de ti, s� generoso:
           lib�rtame de m�....

MARSILLA.                      No sigas, basta.
           �Quieres que huya de ti? Pues bien, te dejo.
           Valor ... y separ�monos.--En paga,                     390
           en recuerdo si no, de tantas penas
           con gozo por tu amor sobrellevadas,
           permite, Isabel m�a, que te estrechen
           mis brazos una vez....

ISABEL.                          Deja a la esclava
           cumplir con su se�or.

MARSILLA.                       Ser� el abrazo                    395
           de un hermano dulc�simo a su hermana,
           el �sculo ser� que tantas veces
           cambi� feliz en la materna falda
           nuestro amor infantil.

ISABEL.                           No lo recuerdes.

MARSILLA.  Ven....

ISABEL.           No: jam�s.

MARSILLA.                   En vano me rechazas.                  400

ISABEL.    Detente ... o llamo....

MARSILLA.                 �A qui�n? �A don Rodrigo?
           No te figures que a tu grito salga.
           No lisonjeros pl�cemes oyendo,
           su vanidad en el estrado sacia,
           no; lejos de los muros de la villa                     405
           muerde la tierra que su sangre ba�a.

ISABEL.    �Qu� horror! �Le has muerto?

MARSILLA.                        �P�rfida! �te afliges?
           Si lo llego a pensar, �qui�n le librara?

ISABEL.    �Vive?

MARSILLA.        Merced a mi nobleza loca,
           vive: apenas cruzamos las espadas,                     410
           furiosa en �l se encarniz� la m�a:
           un momento despu�s, hundido estaba
           su orgullo en tierra, en mi poder su acero.
           �Oh! �maldita destreza de las armas!
           �Maldito el hombre que virtudes siembra                415
           que le rinden cosecha de desgracias!
           No m�s humanidad, cr�menes quiero.
           A ser cruel tu crueldad me arrastra,
           y en ti la he de emplear. Conmigo ahora
           vas a salir de aqu�.

ISABEL.                        �No, no!

MARSILLA.                              Se trata                   420
           de salvarte, Isabel. �Sabes qu� dijo
           el cobarde que lloras desolada,
           al caer en la lid? �Triunfante quedas;
           pero mi sangre costar� bien cara.�

ISABEL.    �Qu� dijo? �Qu�?

MARSILLA.                  �Me vengar� en don Pedro,              425
           en su esposa, en los tres: guardo las cartas.�

ISABEL.    �Jes�s!

MARSILLA.         �Qu� cartas son?...

ISABEL.                       �T� me has perdido!
           La desventura sigue tus pisadas.
           �D�nde mi esposo est�? D�melo pronto,
           para que fiel a socorrerle vaya,                       430
           y a fuerza de rogar venza sus iras.

MARSILLA.  �Justo Dios! Y �dec�a que me amaba!

ISABEL.    �Con su pasi�n funesta reconvienes
           a la mujer del vengativo Azagra?
           �Te aborrezco! (_Vase._)



ESCENA VIII


MARSILLA

MARSILLA.              �Gran Dios! Ella lo dice.                  435
           Con furor me lo dijo: no me enga�a.
           Ya no hay amor all�. Mortal veneno
           su boca me arroj�, que al fondo pasa
           de mi seno infeliz, y una por una,
           rompe, rompe, me rompe las entra�as.                   440
           Yo con ella, por ella, para ella
           viv�... Sin ella, sin su amor, me falta
           aire que respirar... �Era amor suyo
           el aire que mi pecho respiraba!
           Me le neg�, me le quit�: me ahogo,                     445
           no s� vivir.

VOCES (_dentro._)    Entrad, cercad la casa.

MARSILLA (_todo trastornado_).    No puedo.

VOCES (_dentro_). �Muera, muera!

MARSILLA.                            Eso s�.

ISABEL.                                     Ven.

ADEL.                                Aragoneses,
           yo la sangre vert� de la Sultana;                      450
           pero el Rey de Valencia, esposo suyo,
           tras ella me envi� para matarla.
           Consorte criminal, amante imp�a,
           la muerte de Marsilla maquinaba,
           la muerte de Isabel....

ISABEL (_dentro_).            �Ay!

ADEL.                                  Ved en prueba              455
           esta punta sutil envenenada.
           (_Muestra el pu�al de Zulima._)
           Marsilla lo que digo corrobore:
           cerca de aqu� ha de estar.

(_�brese la puerta del fondo, y sale por ella Isabel, que se
arroja en brazos de Margarita. Marsilla aparece ca�do
en un esca�o._)

ISABEL.                                     �Muerto!

ISABEL.    No le mat� la vengativa mora.
           Donde estuviera yo, �qui�n le tocara?
           Mi desgraciado amor, que fu� su vida ...
           su desgraciado amor es quien le mata.
           Delirante le dije: �Te aborrezco�:                     465
           �l crey� la sacr�lega palabra,
           y expir� de dolor.

MARGARITA.                   Por todo el cielo ...

PEDRO.             �Isabel!

ISABEL.                    Mi bien, perdona
           mi despecho fatal. Yo te adoraba.
           Tuya fu�, tuya soy: en pos del tuyo
           mi enamorado esp�ritu se lanza.

(_Dir�gese adonde est� el cad�ver de Marsilla; pero antes de
llegar, cae sin aliento con los brazos tendidos hacia su
amante._)


FIN DEL DRAMA





NOTES


ACTO PRIMERO

7-8. #que ... el pie = que te ve colocar el pie orillas (a la orilla) de
un precipicio.#

17. #al ser#, _on becoming, when he became_.

33-34. #para vivir ... los tres = para que vivamos los tres con
opulencia.#

48. #costara#, an example of the frequent use of the imperfect
subjunctive for the conditional in this play.

57. #�Qu� habr� escrito...?# Note use of future to express
conjecture. _What can he have written...?_

87. #Mira ... dice#, _see whether it says_.

90. #en el encierro aquel = en aquel encierro.#

106-107. #ve a buscarme#; literally, _go to find me_; translate:
_come to me_.

113. #volvi� = volvi� en s�#, _he has come to himself, has regained
consciousness_.

115-116. #De aquella ... hecho = est� hecho (acostumbrado) a las
tinieblas de aquella horrible mansi�n.#

135-136. #desde hoy ... aflija = desde hoy no permitir� que te aflija
ning�n af�n.#

140. #azorado#. Note that in poetry predicate adjectives or past
participles are frequently used instead of adverbs.

147. #Haz ... vea = haz que yo vea a mi bienhechora.#

155. #Defienda#, _may Heaven protect_, etc.

162. #m�s = es m�s hermoso.#

179-180. #No es ... mora = lo m�s (importante) no es que la noble
princesa mora me redima.#

191 et seq. In the first edition of the play Marsilla begins the account
of his adventures thus:

          Mi nombre es Diego Marsilla,
          y cuna Teruel me di�,
          ciudad que ayer se fund�
          del Turia en la fresca orilla.

In the interest of accuracy of detail the author changed this to the
reading of the present text. The river flowing past Teruel changes its
name from Guadalaviar to Turia only after it has left Teruel behind.
Moreover, Teruel was, strictly speaking, _villa_ at the time of the
supposed action of the play, and not _ciudad_: the title _ciudad_ was
not granted to it by the King of Aragon until the year 1347.

193. #Ayer se fund�.# Destroyed by the Moors, Teruel was rebuilt in
1171, forty-six years earlier. In the life of a city, a generation seems
but a day.

195-197. #cuyos muros ... pobladores = cuyos muros, levantados entre
horrores de lid atroz, fueron amasados con la sangre de sus fuertes
pobladores.#

199-226. In these lines the idea of "predestined love" is exemplified.

204. #sus#, _their_ (#del hombre y de la mujer#).

213-214. #antes ... vernos = antes de vernos, nos am�bamos.#

219-222. A similar idea was expressed in the corresponding four lines of
the first edition thus:

          Y parec�a un querer
          tan firme en alma de ni�o,
          recuerdo de otro cari�o
          tenido antes de nacer.

223-226. These four lines may be translated thus: _the love that united
Isabel and me_ (#nuestro querer#) _when we came into this sad world
was merely the continuance_ (#seguir#) _in the physical world of the
love that already existed in the spiritual_. Compare idea expressed by
"marriages are made in heaven."

246. #aun vivo#; if the time were up, either I should have succeeded
or should now be dead.

254. #Navas de Tolosa#, village in the Province of Ja�n, in the south
of Spain, famous in history because of the decisive victory gained
there, July 16, 1212, by the allied kings of Christian Spain over the
Moslems. In the first edition, at the mention of this disastrous defeat
of the Moors, Zulima interrupts Marsilla's narrative with an outburst of
feeling quite appropriate in a Mohammedan:

          �Lugar maldito del cielo,
          donde la negra fortuna
          postr� de la media luna
          la pujanza por el suelo!

258 et seq. In the early years of the 13th century a religious sect in
the south of France, the Albigenses, rebelled against the authority of
the Church of Rome. Pope Innocent III proclaimed a crusade against them
in 1208, and a bloody war began in which the crusaders were led by the
ruthless Simon de Montfort until his death at the siege of Toulouse
(1218). During this Albigensian War (1208-1229) Beziers and other
important cities in the south of France were almost destroyed.

267-270. #Y en pena ... sepult� = y en pena de que mi mano rompi� el
hierro de mis cadenas, profundo encierro me sepult� en vida.#

281. #haz por escuchar atento#, _try to listen attentively to_ ...

293. #aqu�#, in the land of the Moors.

303. #Respuesta ... d� = es bien que se le d� a ella respuesta.#

311-312. #Medita ... reclama#, _consider it well and you will grant
to time what it demands as its due_. If you take into consideration the
length of time that has passed since you have seen Isabel, you will
realize that she has probably forgotten you, and will become reconciled
to changed conditions because of the lapse of time.

321. #dada ... recibida#, _having given my love and having received
hers_; or, _having given my heart in exchange for hers_.

330. #le = su coraz�n.#

335-336. #la nueva de ser Isabel esposa#, _the news of Isabel's
marriage_.

340. #cuanto fabrico derrumba = derrumba cuanto (todo lo que) yo
fabrico.#

345. #han de traer = traer�n.# Note that _Isabel_ is direct object of
_traer_.

346. #para tanto = para hacer tanto.#

356. #S�lvete su diligencia#, _let his efforts save you from danger_.

361. #perec�is = perecer�is.# Present instead of future for greater
vividness.

364-366. #estallo = hubiera estallado; calla = habr�a callado; llega =
habr�a llegado.#

392. #que venga.# Subject of _venga_ is _la rebeli�n,_ line 394.

395-396. Note that _quien_ is subject of both _lema_ and _d�_.

425. #el un capit�n = uno de los capitanes.#

444. #Ya no hay perd�n que le alcance#, _she is beyond the reach of
pardon_.

445-446. #despu�s de correr ... vencido# = _after the struggle is
over, disposition will be made of the conquered_.


ACTO SEGUNDO

17. #don Jaime#, James the Conqueror, King of Aragon from 1213 to
1276, son and successor of Pedro II. He gained the title, _El
Conquistador_, by his conquest of the Balearic Islands (1228-1232) and
Valencia (1258) from the Moors.

21. #Sancho VII#, King of Navarre (1194-1234), known as _El Fuerte_.
He played an important part in the defeat of the Moors at Navas de
Tolosa in 1212.

21. #Fernando III#, King of Castile (1217-1252), known as _El Santo_.
He reconquered Cordova, Seville, Ja�n, etc,. from the Moors.

87-88. #sobre como ... allanar#, _as to how it should be smoothed,
overcome_.

102. #�Virgen del Pilar!# _Our Lady of the Sacred Pillar protect us!_
In the church of _Nuestra Se�ora del Pilar_, Saragossa, is the sacred
pillar on which the Holy Virgin is believed to have appeared to Saint
James during his missionary journey through Spain. This pillar, with its
wooden image of the Virgin and Child, is the magnet that has drawn
countless pilgrims to Saragossa.

131-132. #de estarse ... pesta�ear#, _from standing so long with
staring, unblinking, eyes_.

137-139. #le fu� ... al infeliz = la punta le fu� a parar al coraz�n del
infeliz.#

174. #querr�.# Future to denote probability.

186. #Pues ... partido#, _well, even in throwing the bar I can win
the game from him_. _Barra_, was a game in which the contestants strove
to outdo each other in throwing a heavy iron bar. It was therefore a
test of strength.

197. #Jam�s ... cara#, _never from danger do I turn my face_.

204. #la mano que todo lo gu�a#, _the hand that directs the
universe_, the hand of God.

208-209. #ben�fica, airada#. Note that adjectives are frequently used
instead of adverbs, especially in poetry.

212. #de amante inquietud#, _inspired by loving solicitude_, that of
his own family.

213. #no cobre#..., _may I never recover_...

215. #Mayor mi tes�n a m�s padecer#, _my obstinacy increasing with my
suffering_. Compare _mi tes�n crec�a con mi padecer_, of the first
edition.

239-240. #decid ... vida#, _tell her to whom this father_ (Martin
himself) _owes the privilege of seeing himself alive_.

247-248. Compare with these the two corresponding lines of the first
edition:

        Con tal compa�era, �qui�n no ha de temblar
        de perder la vida que lleva dichosa?

255-256. #dirige = hubiese dirigido; ahorran = habr�an ahorrado; cu�nto
de llanto = �cu�ntas l�grimas!#

259. #la de Maurel#, the battle of Muret in southern France, 1213, in
which the Albigenses and their allies, the Aragonese, were defeated by
the Crusaders under Simon de Montfort. King Pedro of Aragon lost his
life in the battle and many Aragonese were killed or taken prisoners.

275-276. #Diligencia escasa ... cupo = parece que diligencia escasa,
fortuna severa, cupo en suerte a# (_fell to the lot of_) #mi sangre
(familia).#

278. #se muestre#, _let him show himself_. Freely translated: _one

(#los acentos desabridos#) _did not have a disagreeable sound for
me_.

347. #al recordar mi memoria#, _when memory would bring to mind_.

371 et seq. Note that _vos, piedra, b�veda, suelo_ are all direct

... that vaulted ceiling ... that pavement ... do I call upon as
witnesses_....

377. #a no ser ... huella#, _if it were not as hard and cold as the
one that walks upon it_.

381. #que# = _for_; #le = al af�n.#

384. #oyera = pudiera, podr�a, o�rla.#

413. #ofrec� dar#, _I would gladly have given_.

423-426. Compare corresponding lines in first edition:

          que mis penas un momento
          suspendan su intensidad.

559. #de infeliz ... m�s#, _from an unhappy state I have passed to
one still more wretched_.

564-565. #por se�as que ... jud�o.# Teresa's meaning is clear; he
must be either a Jew or a Moor, she thinks, since he refused to partake
of the slices of pork and wine that she had offered him. She might have
expressed herself more logically thus: _por se�as que_ (as proof that)
_debe ser moro o jud�o, nada de ello (magras y vino) ha probado_.

the old parochial church in Teruel connected with the legend of _Los

pasi�n, tan sublime por lo menos como el famoso _Qu'il mour�t_ de

explanation, adds _Esto es antes_, meaning, _rather is this it_, i.e.,
the true explanation.

166. #mal pudiera = mal podr�a (enga�arme).#

201-202. #Pasa m�s#, _more has happened; there is still more to

A comparison of the closing lines of the play with those of the first
version shows a decided gain in dramatic effectiveness.

ISABEL.      �Conque ya es muerto?

TODOS.     �Muerto!

ISABEL.              Yo le mat�; quise alejarle ...
           que le odiaba le dije ... el sentimiento,
           el espanto ... �Y ment�!...
           Pero tambi�n de m� se apiada el cielo.
           Ya de la eternidad me abre la puerta
           y de mis ojos huye el mundo entero,
           y una tumba diviso solamente
           con un cad�ver, y a su lado un hueco.
           Marsilla, yo te am�, siempre te amaba ...
           t� me lloraste ajena ... tuya muero.

Cotarelo y Mori, in his scholarly study of the origin and development of
the legend, uses as an argument against its historical authenticity the
improbable ending; skeptically, he asks the question: "�No es
verdaderamente pasmoso que en el siglo XIII hubiese ni en Teruel ni en
parte alguna dos personas de sensibilidad tan exquisita a quienes
simult�neamente pudiera causar la muerte el verse privadas una de otra?"
This rhetorical question was answered many years before it was thus
formulated. Jos� de Larra in his review of the play a few days after its
first performance and only a few days before his own tragic death,
speaking for those who believe that death may be caused by grief alone,
urged the author to pay no heed to critics who scoffed at the
_d�nouement_ of his play: "Si �yese repetir a sus o�dos un cargo vulgar
que a los nuestros ha llegado, y que ni mentar hemos querido en este
art�culo; si �yese decir que el final de su obra es inveros�mil, que el
amor no mata a nadie, puede responder que es un hecho consignado en la
historia; que los cad�veres se conservan en Teruel, y la posibilidad en
los corazones sensibles; que las penas y las pasiones han llenado m�s
cementerios que los m�dicos y los necios; que el amor mata (aunque no
mate a lodo el mundo) como matan la ambici�n y la envidia; que m�s de
una mala nueva al ser recibida ha matado a personas robustas,
instant�neamente y como un rayo; y aun ser� en nuestro entender mejor
que a ese cargo no responda, porque el que no lleve en su coraz�n la
respuesta, no comprender� ninguna. Las teor�as, las doctrinas, los
sistemas se explican; los sentimientos se sienten." (_Colecci�n de
art�culos_, page 197.)





VOCABULARY


The purpose of this vocabulary is to give English equivalents for the
words and locutions as used in this play, in order to help the student
understand the text or translate it into clear, idiomatic English. In
some cases, therefore, the English equivalent is not a literal
translation of the Spanish and may not give the usual meaning of the
word or phrase. Moreover, words that the student is reasonably certain
to know and those that have the same or almost the same form and meaning
in Spanish and English are omitted, as well as inflected forms, except
in the case of those that seem to offer special difficulty.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
