This etext was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>

Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net
http://promo.net/pg


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03
or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this etext,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

MARK TWAIN, A BIOGRAPHY 1835-1866
by Albert Bigelow Paine[mt1bgxxx.xxx] #2982

Absolute unaccountability of conduct
Benjamin Franklin and Samuel Clemens
Bret Harte
Court exertion.  I love work
"Do you swear?"  "Not for amusement; only under pressure."
Doing things and reflecting afterward
Dr.  Holmes's Songs in Many Keys
His estimation of his own work was always unsafe
Income equal to that then earned by the Vice-President of the US
Jim Wolfe and the cats
Kissed each other, something hitherto unknown
Less than a cent an acre
Man who has that eye doesn't need to go armed
Never affiliate with inferiors; always climb
Not Mark Twain's habit to strive for humor
Nothing that glitters is gold
Out of the window, and I carried the sash along with me.
Perfect air of not knowing it to be humorous
Ready acknowledgment of shortcoming
Seeing them in print was a joy
Seek companionship among men of superior intellect and character
Sick were made well, and the well made better
Swayed by every passing emotion and influence
Twain did not remember ever having seen or heard his father lau
Unerring faculty for making business mistakes
Voluntarily retired from the service
Ways and means were not always considered
Wife was a new kind of possession





MARK TWAIN, A BIOGRAPHY 1866-1875
by Albert Bigelow Paine[mt2bgxxx.xxx] #2983

American habit of carrying a cotton umbrella
Auntie Rachel
Death that made its beginning there
Does not seem to be in all respects a reptile
Don't take the bull by the horns-take him by the tail
Dr. John Brown
Expectant look in the Eastern horizon
Forgotten that he had ever had any other views
He had no prejudices about clothes
Jealousy
Josh Billings
Know so much that isn't so.
Lecky's History of European Morals';
Liberty, justice, humanity
Life and death that made its beginning there
Likely to write not wisely but too much
Ma likes funerals
Mark Twain Scrap-Book
Marriages are what the parties to them alone really know
Nothing but almost inspired lying got me out of this scrape
Ornament of a house is the friends that frequent it
Potter's "English violet" order of design
Praise, but not of an intemperate sort
Praises to whatever seemed genuine
Proceeded from unreasoned selfishness to reasoned selfishness
Read not so many books, but read a few books often
Ridicule to the things considered sham
Selfishness
Sketches which every artist has, turned face to the wall
Some folks mistake vivacity for wit
Terrible death to be talked to death
True Story
Western humor
Wife was for years afflicted with freckles







MARK TWAIN, A BIOGRAPHY, 1875-1886
by Albert Bigelow Paine, [mt3bg10.txt] #2984

Absentmindedness
Between Harte and Clemens, the whole matter was unfortunate
Bible
Canadian girls so pretty
Cat having a fit in a platter of tomatoes
Cazenova, and Rousseau.
Communism is idiocy
Confusions of memory and imagination
Conscience ain't got no sense
Consider every man colored till he is proved white
Cynic; restrained
Damning with faint praise
Drawn the sting of my fiftieth year; taken away the pain of it
Fathers be alike, mayhap; mine hath not a doll's temper
Fear God and dread the Sunday-school
France has neither winter, nor summer, nor morals
Graham Bell
Hain't we all the fools in town on our side?
Happily, the little child was to evade that harsher penalty
Hatred of humbug, and a scorn for cant
Header
Hickory-nuts
I could a staid if I'd a wanted to, but I didn't want to.
If loyalty to party is a form of patriotism, I am no patriot
Lecky
Livy, if it comforts you to lean on the Christian faith do so!
Modest" Club
My advice is not to raise the flag
Operas
Optimist
Pessimist
Pretty soon we shall have been dead a hundred years
Religion
Resenting, even when most amused by it, extravagance and burles
Rubaiyat
Style that is not a style at all but the very absence of it
Symbol of the race ought to be a human being carrying an ax
Teaspoonful of brains
They fought, that a mother might own her child
Under dog in the fight
Well, it 'most kills me, but it pays
What is Man





MARK TWAIN, A BIOGRAPHY, 1886-1900
by Albert Bigelow Paine [mt4bg10.txt]#2985

Address he made at Yale College
And now she is dead--& I can never tell her.
And of the article: "I read it to the cat
Been on the verge of being an angel all my life
Carbuncle is a kind of jewel
Compliment that helps us on our way
Defeat waits somewhere for every conqueror
Don't reform any more.  It is not an improvement
Edited manuscript-by a half wit
Embroidery line
Every man is strong until his price is named
Feverish desire to admire the newest thing
Flood-tide is a temporary condition
Genius has no youth
God is on both sides in this war
Good-by.  Will healing ever come, or life have value again?
Honor is a harder master than the law
Humor should take its outings in grave company
I hope his uncle's funeral will be a failure!
Immensely but unintelligently interested
It cannot be safe for a man at my time of life to laugh so much
Just say the report of my death has been grossly exaggerated
Letter written in a passion is a mistake
Man is the only animal that blushes, or that needs to
Mind, if this is going to be too much trouble to you
Neither the refinement nor the weakness of a college education
Never a throne which did not represent a crime
Only a human being, he said, could have done these things
Only by resisting temptation that men grow strong
Prepared and memorized a very good speech but had forgotten it.
Preserve your illusions
Pronounced Mrs. Clemens free from any organic ills
Put all your eggs into one basket--and watch that basket
Refused ten thousand dollars for a tobacco indorsement
There is not much choice between a removal & a funeral
What is biography?  Unadorned romance
Whenever I enjoy anything in art it means that it is poor
Won't be anybody for you to get acquainted with but God
Won't you please say something funny?"





MARK TWAIN, A BIOGRAPHY, 1900-1907

God is sitting up nights worrying over the individuals
God must love you!
Hail you as the Voltaire of America
Hair
His conscience was always repairing itself
How poor we are to-day!
Human being needs to revise his ideas again about God
I am as one who wanders and has lost his way
I am tired & old; I wish I were with Livy
I am tired wanting for that man to get old
I would not call her back if I could
If I could only see a dog that I knew in the old times
Billiards
Impatient as the Creator doubtless was to see man
Impromptu speech
It was his habit to grow fond of his surroundings
Jester, who for forty years had been making the world laugh
Last and best of life for which the first was made
Learned the meaning of grief
Letter on inadvertant theft on a visit to friends
Life is a game of whist.
Looks like a good deal of trouble for such a small result
Loss of one whose memory is the only thing I worship
Machine that is as unreliable as he is would have no market
Man the irresponsible Machine
Man was made at the end of the week's work when God was tired
Massacre of Jews in Moscow
Mental healing
No general fondness for poetry; but many poems appealed to him
Number of things I can remember that aren't so
One could lose a dog in this bed," he declared
Only dead men can tell the truth in this world
Our alphabet is pure insanity
Oyster has hardly any more reasoning power than a man
Patriotism that proposed to keep the Stars and Stripes clean
Pier
Political conscience into somebody else's keeping
Poorest, clumsiest excuse of all the creatures

Smoked constantly, loathed exercise
Subcutaneous injection of brandy saved her
Tannhauser
Teeth
"The country home I need," he said, fiercely, "is a cemetery."
The rest is silence
There is no such thing as a new idea
Threescore years and ten!
To My Missionary Critics
To the Person Sitting in Darkness
War Prayer
Was the World Made for Man
We are always too busy for our children
We have no real morals, but only artificial ones
What an amusing creature the human being is!"
What are you going to do, you poor soul?
Wheresoever she was, there was Eden
Would you do it again if you had the chance?
Yes, we are a sufficiently comical invention, we humans





MARK TWAIN, A BIOGRAPHY, 1907-1910
by Albert Bigelow Paine [mt6bg10.txt]#2987

Affection--that is the last and final and most precious reward
All beggars, each in his own way
Always an incompleteness somewhere, and the shadow
Assent to what must be
Ax on his shoulder proceeding toward a grindstone
Beating the dirge of yesterday or the tattoo of to-morrow
Begum, of Bengal,  days out from Canton--homeward bound!
Best friend I have ever had, but is the best man I have known
Brown's Hotel
Byron
Casanova & Pepys & Saint Simon
Cats really owned Stormfield
Certainty
Chastity, you can carry it too far.
Claudius
Conceit in believing that he was the Creator's pet
Continuous procession of blood and slaughter and stench
Costs even more to entertain a dog than a burglar
Curiosities and absurdities of religious superstitions
Death--the only immortal who treats us all alike
Despises pretenders and charlatans of all sorts
Dreaming of the past or anticipating the future
Dying I don't want to be stimulated back to life
Each of us knows it all, and knows he knows it all
Eighty-five hundred guests at the King's party
Entered upon a holiday whose other end is the cemetery
Even members of his household did not always stir his conscious
Every man builds his God according to his own capacities.
Fame had deprived him of valued privileges.
Frankness is a jewel; only the young can afford it
Glad, for the sake of the dead, that they have escaped
God Trust motto on the coins
Got a genuine excuse.  It makes me feel so honest
Government that robs its own people earns its future
Habits take precedence of thought
He lived in the present
I have never greatly envied any one but the dead
Incite public favorites to dangerous ambitions
Infamous doctrine of allegiance to party
Interpreting the deity
Jane Austen's books
Knights of Labor
Letters from the Earth
Letters of Madame de Sevigne
Life is too long and too short
Loved him all my life, and I'll love him till I die
Loyalty to petrified opinions never yet broke a chain
Make other men not fit to die, but fit to live
Man who isn't a pessimist is a d---d fool."
Many things had been discussed and put away for good
Mendicancy
Museum of Natural History
Nobler to teach others to be good, and less trouble
Nothing is ever at rest--wood, iron, water, everything is alive
October th was a perfect wedding-day
Oh, it is such a mystery, and it takes so long
Optimism
Party have somehow got a mortgage on his soul

THE BOYS' LIFE OF MARK TWAIN
by Albert Bigelow Paine [mt8bg10.txt]#3463

It was the 2d of February, 1870, that Samuel Clemens and Olivia Langdon
were married. A few days before, he sat down one night and wrote to Jim
Gillis, away out in the Tuolumne Hills, and told him of all his good
fortune, recalling their days at Angel's Camp, and the absurd frog story,
which he said had been the beginning of his happiness. In the five years
since then he had traveled a long way, but he had not forgotten.

"Roughing It," in fact, proved a very successful book. Like "The
Innocents Abroad," it was the first of its kind, fresh in its humor and
description, true in its picture of the frontier life he had known. In
three months forty thousand copies had been sold, and now, after more
than forty years, it is still a popular book. The life it describes is
all gone--the scenes are changed. It is a record of a vanished time--a
delightful history--as delightful to-day as ever.

England fairly reveled in Mark Twain. At one of the great banquets, a
roll of the distinguished guests was called, and the names properly
applauded. Mark Twain, busily engaged in low conversation with his
neighbor, applauded without listening, vigorously or mildly, as the
others led. Finally a name was followed by a great burst of long and
vehement clapping. This must be some very great person indeed, and Mark
Twain, not to be outdone in his approval, stoutly kept his hands going
when all others had finished.

"Whose name was that we were just applauding?" he asked of his neighbor.
--"Mark Twain's."

They remained for a time in London--a period of honors and entertainment.
If Mark Twain had been a lion on his first visit, he was hardly less than
royalty now. His rooms at the Langham Hotel were like a court. The
nation's most distinguished men--among them Robert Browning, Sir John
Millais, Lord Houghton, and Sir Charles Dilke--came to pay their
respects. Authors were calling constantly. Charles Reade and Wilkie
Collins could not get enough of Mark Twain. Reade proposed to join with
him in writing a novel, as Warner had done. Lewis Carroll did not call,
being too timid, but they met the author of "Alice in Wonderland" one
night at a dinner, "the shyest full-grown man, except Uncle Remiss, I
ever saw," Mark Twain once declared.

At Quarry Farm that summer Mark Twain began the writing of "The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer." He had been planning for some time to set down
the story of those far-off days along the river-front at Hannibal, with
John Briggs, Tom Blankenship, and the rest of that graceless band, and
now in the cool luxury of a little study which Mrs. Crane had built for
him on the hillside he set himself to spin the fabric of his youth. The
study was a delightful place to work. It was octagonal in shape, with
windows on all sides, something like a pilot-house. From any direction
the breeze could come, and there were fine views. To Twichell he wrote:

"I came in with Halley's comet in 1835. It is coming again next year, and
I expect to go out with it. It will be the greatest disappointment of my
life if I don't go out with Halley's comet."

The terms of Samuel Clemens's apprenticeship were the usual thing for
that day: board and clothes--"more board than clothes, and not much of
either," Mark Twain used to say.

"If your memory extends so far back, you will recall a little sandy-
haired boy of nearly a quarter of a century ago, in the printing-office
at Hannibal, over the Brittingham drug-store, mounted upon a little box
at the case, who used to love to sing so well the statement of the poor
drunken man who was supposed to have fallen by the wayside, 'If ever I
get up again, I'll stay up--if I kin.'"

"Do you swear?"--"N-not for amusement; only under pressure."

"When I was younger I could remember anything, whether it happened or
not; but I am getting old, and soon I shall remember only the latter."





TWAIN'S LETTERS V1 1835-1866
by A. B. Paine[mt1lt10.txt] #3193

A mighty national menace to sham
All talk and no cider
Condition my room is always in when you are not around
Deprived of the soothing consolation of swearing
Frankness is a jewel; only the young can afford it
Genius defies the laws of perspective
Hope deferred maketh the heart sick
I never greatly envied anybody but the dead
In the long analysis of the ages it is the truth that counts
Just about enough cats to go round
Moral bulwark reared against hypocrisy and superstition
The coveted estate of silence, time's only absolute gift
We went outside to keep from getting wet
What a pleasure there is in revenge!
When in doubt, tell the truth
When it is my turn, I don't





TWAIN'S LETTERS V2 1867-1875
by A. B. Paine[mt2lt10.txt] #3194

DEAR REDPATH,--I wish you would get me released from the lecture at
Buffalo.  I mortally hate that society there, and I don't doubt they
hired me.  I once gave them a packed house free of charge, and they never
even had the common politeness to thank me.  They left me to shift for
myself, too, a la Bret Harte at Harvard.  Get me rid of Buffalo!
Otherwise I'll have no recourse left but to get sick the day I lecture
there.  I can get sick easy enough.

I send you No. 5 today.  I have written and re-written the first half of
it three different times, yesterday and today, and at last Mrs. Clemens
says it will do.  I never saw a woman so hard to please about things she
doesn't know anything about.  Yours ever,  MARK.

This is the place to get a poor opinion of everybody in.  There isn't one
man in Washington, in civil office, who has the brains of Anson
Burlingame--and I suppose if China had not seized and saved his great
talents to the world, this government would have discarded him when his
time was up.  There are more pitiful intellects in this Congress!  Oh,
geeminy!  There are few of them that I find pleasant enough company to
visit.  I am most infernally tired of Wash.  and its "attractions."  To
be busy is a man's only happiness--and I am--otherwise I should die
Yrs.  aff.   SAM.




TWAIN'S LETTERS V3 1876-1885
by Albert Bigelow Paine[mt3lt10.txt] #3195

It is interesting to note that in thanking Clemens for his compliment
Howells wrote: "What people cannot see is that I analyze as little as
possible; they go on talking about the analytical school, which I am
supposed to belong to, and I want to thank you for using your eyes.....
Did you ever read De Foe's 'Roxana'?  If not, then read it, not merely
for some of the deepest insights into the lying, suffering, sinning,
well-meaning human soul, but for the best and most natural English that a
book was ever written in."

Pray offer my most sincere and respectful approval to the President--is
approval the proper word?  I find it is the one I most value here in the
household and seldomest get.

In the same letter he suggests to his brother that he undertake an
absolutely truthful autobiography, a confession in which nothing is to be
withheld.  He cites the value of Casanova's memories, and the confessions
of Rousseau.

And I say this also: He that waiteth for all men to be satisfied with his
plan, let him seek eternal life, for he shall need it.

Well-good-bye, and a short life and a merry one be yours.  Poor old
Methusaleh, how did he manage to stand it so long?

You are assisted in your damaging work by the tyrannous ways of a
village--villagers watch each other and so make cowards of each other.





TWAIN'S LETTERS V4 1886-1900
by Albert Bigelow Paine[mt4lt10.txt] #3196

And I have been an author for 20 years and an ass for 55
Argument against suicide
Conversationally being yelled at
Dead people who go through the motions of life
Die in the promptest kind of a way and no fooling around
Heroic endurance that resembles contentment
Honest men must be pretty scarce
I wonder how they can lie so.  It comes of practice, no doubt
If this is going to be too much trouble to you
One should be gentle with the ignorant
Sunday is the only day that brings unbearable leisure
Symbol of the human race ought to be an ax
What a pity it is that one's adventures never happen!





TWAIN'S LETTERS V5 1901-1906
by Albert Bigelow Paine[mt5lt10.txt] #3197

I have seen that iceberg thirty-four times in thirty-seven voyages; it is
always the same shape, it is always the same size, it always throws up
the same old flash when the sun strikes it; you may set it on any New
York door-step of a June morning and light it up with a mirror-flash; and
I will engage to recognize it.  It is artificial, and it is provided and
anchored out by the steamer companies.  I used to like the sea, but I was
young then, and could easily get excited over any kind of monotony, and
keep it up till the monotonies ran out, if it was a fortnight.

It vexes me to catch myself praising the clean private citizen Roosevelt,
and blaming the soiled President Roosevelt, when I know that neither
praise nor blame is due to him for any thought or word or deed of his, he
being merely a helpless and irresponsible coffee-mill ground by the hand
of God.

It was a presidential year and the air was thick with politics.  Mark
Twain was no longer actively interested in the political situation; he
was only disheartened by the hollowness and pretense of office-seeking,
and the methods of office-seekers in general.

Shall we ever laugh again?  If I could only see a dog that I knew in the
old times! and could put my arms around his neck and tell him all,
everything, and ease my heart.  Think--in 3 hours it will be a week!--and
soon a month; and by and by a year.  How fast our dead fly from us.

Aldrich was here half an hour ago, like a breeze from over the fields,
with the fragrance still upon his spirit.  I am tired of waiting for that
man to get old.

When a man is a pessimist before 48 he knows too much; if he is an
optimist after it, he knows too little.





TWAIN'S LETTERS V6 1907-1910
by Albert Bigelow Paine[mt6lt10.txt] #3198

That doctor had half an idea that there is something the matter with my
brain.  .  .  Doctors do know so little and they do charge so much for it.

You ought not to say sarcastic things about my "fighting on the other
side."  General Grant did not act like that.  General Grant paid me
compliments.  He bracketed me with Zenophon--it is there in his Memoirs
for anybody to read.  He said if all the confederate soldiers had
followed my example and adopted my military arts he could never have
caught enough of them in a bunch to inconvenience the Rebellion.  General
Grant was a fair man, and recognized my worth; but you are prejudiced,
and you have hurt my feelings.

DEAR HOWELLS,--I have to write a line, lazy as I am, to say how your Poe
article delighted me; and to say that I am in agreement with
substantially all you say about his literature.  To me his prose is
unreadable--like Jane Austin's.  No, there is a difference.  I could read
his prose on salary, but not Jane's.  Jane is entirely impossible.  It
seems a great pity that they allowed her to die a natural death.
