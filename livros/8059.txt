Book 59        James

59:001:001 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
           twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.

59:001:002 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
           temptations;

59:001:003 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.

59:001:004 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect
           and entire, wanting nothing.

59:001:005 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
           all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given
           him.

59:001:006 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that
           wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and
           tossed.

59:001:007 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of
           the Lord.

59:001:008 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.

59:001:009 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:

59:001:010 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of
           the grass he shall pass away.

59:001:011 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
           withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the
           grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich
           man fade away in his ways.

59:001:012 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is
           tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath
           promised to them that love him.

59:001:013 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for
           God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:

59:001:014 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own
           lust, and enticed.

59:001:015 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin,
           when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

59:001:016 Do not err, my beloved brethren.

59:001:017 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and
           cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no
           variableness, neither shadow of turning.

59:001:018 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
           should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

59:001:019 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to
           hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:

59:001:020 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.

59:001:021 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
           naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word,
           which is able to save your souls.

59:001:022 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving
           your own selves.

59:001:023 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
           unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:

59:001:024 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
           forgetteth what manner of man he was.

59:001:025 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and
           continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a
           doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

59:001:026 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not
           his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion
           is vain.

59:001:027 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
           To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to
           keep himself unspotted from the world.

59:002:001 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
           Lord of glory, with respect of persons.

59:002:002 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring,
           in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile
           raiment;

59:002:003 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and
           say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the
           poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:

59:002:004 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges
           of evil thoughts?

59:002:005 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of
           this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he
           hath promised to them that love him?

59:002:006 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you,
           and draw you before the judgment seats?

59:002:007 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are
           called?

59:002:008 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou
           shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:

59:002:009 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are
           convinced of the law as transgressors.

59:002:010 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
           point, he is guilty of all.

59:002:011 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not
           kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou
           art become a transgressor of the law.

59:002:012 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the
           law of liberty.

59:002:013 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no
           mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

59:002:014 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath
           faith, and have not works? can faith save him?

59:002:015 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,

59:002:016 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed
           and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things
           which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?

59:002:017 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.

59:002:018 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me
           thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by
           my works.

59:002:019 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the
           devils also believe, and tremble.

59:002:020 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is
           dead?

59:002:021 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
           offered Isaac his son upon the altar?

59:002:022 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was
           faith made perfect?

59:002:023 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed
           God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was
           called the Friend of God.

59:002:024 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
           faith only.

59:002:025 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works,
           when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out
           another way?

59:002:026 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
           works is dead also.

59:003:001 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall
           receive the greater condemnation.

59:003:002 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in
           word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the
           whole body.

59:003:003 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey
           us; and we turn about their whole body.

59:003:004 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are
           driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very
           small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.

59:003:005 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great
           things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!

59:003:006 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the
           tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and
           setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of
           hell.

59:003:007 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and
           of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of
           mankind:

59:003:008 But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of
           deadly poison.

59:003:009 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse
           we men, which are made after the similitude of God.

59:003:010 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
           brethren, these things ought not so to be.

59:003:011 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
           bitter?

59:003:012 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a
           vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and
           fresh.

59:003:013 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him
           shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of
           wisdom.

59:003:014 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory
           not, and lie not against the truth.

59:003:015 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly,
           sensual, devilish.

59:003:016 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every
           evil work.

59:003:017 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then
           peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and
           good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

59:003:018 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that
           make peace.

59:004:001 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not
           hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?

59:004:002 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot
           obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.

59:004:003 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may
           consume it upon your lusts.

59:004:004 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the
           friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever
           therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

59:004:005 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that
           dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?

59:004:006 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth
           the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.

59:004:007 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he
           will flee from you.

59:004:008 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your
           hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.

59:004:009 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned
           to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.

59:004:010 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift
           you up.

59:004:011 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil
           of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the
           law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art
           not a doer of the law, but a judge.

59:004:012 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who
           art thou that judgest another?

59:004:013 Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into
           such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and
           get gain:

59:004:014 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is
           your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little
           time, and then vanisheth away.

59:004:015 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and
           do this, or that.

59:004:016 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is
           evil.

59:004:017 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to
           him it is sin.

59:005:001 Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that
           shall come upon you.

59:005:002 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.

59:005:003 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall
           be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were
           fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.

59:005:004 Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your
           fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the
           cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of
           the Lord of sabaoth.

59:005:005 Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye
           have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.

59:005:006 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist
           you.

59:005:007 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
           Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the
           earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the
           early and latter rain.

59:005:008 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of
           the Lord draweth nigh.

59:005:009 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be
           condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.

59:005:010 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name
           of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of
           patience.

59:005:011 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
           patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the
           Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.

59:005:012 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by
           heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but
           let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into
           condemnation.

59:005:013 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let
           him sing psalms.

59:005:014 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the
           church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in
           the name of the Lord:

59:005:015 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord
           shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall
           be forgiven him.

59:005:016 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
           that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a
           righteous man availeth much.

59:005:017 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he
           prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on
           the earth by the space of three years and six months.

59:005:018 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth
           brought forth her fruit.

59:005:019 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert
           him;

59:005:020 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the
           error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide
           a multitude of sins.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to

above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
