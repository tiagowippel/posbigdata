Book 37 Haggai
001:001 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month,
        in the first day of the month, the Word of Yahweh came
        by Haggai, the prophet, to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel,
        governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak,
        the high priest, saying,
001:002 "This is what Yahweh of Armies says:  These people say,
        'The time hasn't yet come, the time for Yahweh's house
        to be built.'"
001:003 Then the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai, the prophet, saying,
001:004 "Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses,
        while this house lies waste?
001:005 Now therefore this is what Yahweh of Armies says:
        Consider your ways.
001:006 You have sown much, and bring in little.  You eat, but you don't
        have enough.  You drink, but you aren't filled with drink.
        You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm, and he who earns
        wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes in it."
001:007 This is what Yahweh of Armies says:  "Consider your ways.
001:008 Go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build the house.
        I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified," says Yahweh.
001:009 "You looked for much, and, behold, it came to little;
        and when you brought it home, I blew it away.  Why?" says Yahweh
        of Armies, "Because of my house that lies waste, while each
        of you is busy with his own house.
001:010 Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew,
        and the earth withholds its fruit.
001:011 I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain,
        on the new wine, on the oil, on that which the ground brings forth,
        on men, on livestock, and on all the labor of the hands."
001:012 Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son
        of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people,
        obeyed the voice of Yahweh, their God, and the words
        of Haggai, the prophet, as Yahweh, their God, had sent him;
        and the people feared Yahweh.
001:013 Then Haggai, Yahweh's messenger, spoke in Yahweh's message
        to the people, saying, "I am with you," says Yahweh.
001:014 Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel,
        governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak,
        the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people;
        and they came and worked on the house of Yahweh of Armies, their God,
001:015 in the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month,
        in the second year of Darius the king.
002:001 In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month,
        the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
002:002 "Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah,
        and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest,
        and to the remnant of the people, saying,
002:003 'Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory?
        How do you see it now?  Isn't it in your eyes as nothing?
002:004 Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,' says Yahweh.
        'Be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
        Be strong, all you people of the land,' says Yahweh, 'and work,
        for I am with you,' says Yahweh of Armies.
002:005 This is the word that I covenanted with you when you
        came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you.
        'Don't be afraid.'
002:006 For this is what Yahweh of Armies says:  'Yet once, it is
        a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth,
        the sea, and the dry land;
002:007 and I will shake all nations.  The precious things of all
        nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,
        says Yahweh of Armies.
002:008 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,' says Yahweh of Armies.
002:009 'The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,'
        says Yahweh of Armies; 'and in this place will I give peace,'
        says Yahweh of Armies."
002:010 In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year
        of Darius, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
002:011 "Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Ask now the priests concerning
        the law, saying,
002:012 'If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment,
        and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food,
        will it become holy?'"  The priests answered, "No."
002:013 Then Haggai said, "If one who is unclean by reason
        of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?"
        The priests answered, "It will be unclean."
002:014 Then Haggai answered, "'So is this people, and so is this nation
        before me,' says Yahweh; 'and so is every work of their hands.
        That which they offer there is unclean.
002:015 Now, please consider from this day and backward, before a stone
        was laid on a stone in the temple of Yahweh.
002:016 Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures,
        there were only ten.  When one came to the wine vat to draw
        out fifty, there were only twenty.
002:017 I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail in all the work
        of your hands; yet you didn't turn to me,' says Yahweh.
002:018 'Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth
        day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation
        of Yahweh's temple was laid, consider it.
002:019 Is the seed yet in the barn?  Yes, the vine, the fig tree,
        the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven't brought forth.
        From this day will I bless you.'"
002:020 The Word of Yahweh came the second time to Haggai in the
        twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,
002:021 "Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, 'I will shake
        the heavens and the earth.
002:022 I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms.  I will
        destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations.
        I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them.
        The horses and their riders will come down, everyone by the sword
        of his brother.
002:023 In that day, says Yahweh of Armies, will I take you,
        Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,' says Yahweh,
        'and will make you as a signet, for I have chosen you,'
        says Yahweh of Armies."

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05

Or /etext04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92,

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
