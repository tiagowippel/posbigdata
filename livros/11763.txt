DEATH OF REV. JAMES POWELL, D.D.

"He whom thou lovest is dead," were the sorrowful words of the stricken
sisters concerning their brother; we repeat them to our many friends who
enjoyed the personal friendship of our beloved brother Powell. These
friends cannot restore him to us, as _the_ Friend restored Lazarus to
his family; but they can sympathize with us in our great bereavement. It
is scarcely three months since our honored president, Gov. Washburn, was
suddenly taken away, and we have not yet found his successor; and now,
Dr. Powell has been removed almost as suddenly, and we can scarcely hope
to find one to take his place. Our only consolation is, that God makes
no mistakes, and that, while men die, His work goes on.

The death of Dr. Powell was unexpected, but its cause lay far back. When
only nineteen years of age, he entered the service of the Christian
Commission, and in the malarial regions of the South, the germs of
disease were planted in his system. They were the cause of frequent and
distressing turns of illness, while his irrepressible energy never
allowed him to take the rest necessary for recovery. The physicians
pronounced the immediate cause of his death to be apoplexy, but most men
carrying his burden of ill-health would have yielded long before; only
his immeasurable hopefulness and activity sustained him to the end.

Rev. James Powell, D.D., was born in Wales, December 25, 1842. At an
early age he came to this country, and partly by his own exertions and
partly by the help of friends whom he had won to himself by his genial
nature and evident indications of future usefulness, he obtained an
education, graduating from Dartmouth College in 1866, and from Andover
Theological Seminary in 1869. He was installed as pastor of the church
at Newburyport in November, 1869, his only pastorate, and remained there
till February, 1873. His health being impaired by his incessant labors
as pastor, he was persuaded by his friend, Rev. Mr. Pike, to aid in
introducing the Jubilee Singers to the English public, with the further
purpose of either remaining abroad to manage the affairs of the Singers
in Great Britain, or of returning and temporarily taking Mr. Pike's
place in Connecticut and New York, as District Secretary of the
Association. The latter alternative was finally decided upon, and Mr.
Powell assumed these duties in the latter part of the year 1873. A year
afterwards, on the resignation of Rev. Dr. Patton from our Chicago
office, Mr. Powell, who had shown remarkable gifts as a speaker, was at
once selected as District Secretary of our Western department. Here he
remained for nearly ten years, when some changes were required in our
district offices and he was called to New York as Assistant
Corresponding Secretary, and entrusted with the supervision of the
entire collecting field. The work he had done so acceptably and
efficiently at the West was followed by equally effective services in
his wider field at the East. In the three years of the recent burden of
debt upon the Association, the energies of Dr. Powell were called into
full play, and when, at our last Annual Meeting, we rejoiced in
deliverance from debt, it was felt that the gratifying result was due in
a large measure to his eloquence by voice and pen. At that meeting Dr.
Powell was elected Corresponding Secretary of the Association.

Bro. Powell was an orator born, not made. His eloquence was not of the
Websterian sort, massive and logical, but rather of that magnetic kind
which wins and sways an audience at will, sometimes to smiles and then
to tears, but always with definite persuasion. He was a brilliant writer
as well as speaker. His pen glowed with a special inspiration, and was
prolific as well. The pages of the AMERICAN MISSIONARY, the columns of
the weekly religious press, the numerous circulars issued from this
office and his abundant correspondence, all bear witness to this. He was
a wise man in counsel. The impassioned and imaginative speaker is not
usually characterized by a cautious judgment or administrative gifts;
but we have found in this office that when grave questions arose for
consideration, Dr. Powell was remarkably conservative and judicious. But
the crowning glory of the man was his bright and genial nature, and his
warm and devoted Christian character. It was this that won all hearts,
that made him welcome on every platform and in every pulpit, that bound
his friends to him in warmest attachment, that opened the doors of all
homes to him and that leaves the memory of brightness behind him in the
offices where he toiled and in his own dear home. His life went out not
as the lightning's flash, that leaves the deeper darkness behind, nor as
the setting sun, that has the night before and after, but his departure
from life was only the entrance into eternal brightness, and leaves a
radiance behind that will be a perpetual joy and consolation to his
friends. He was born on Christmas day, and the festivities of another
Christmas day were not wholly past when he died. His birth was a
Christmas gift to earth, and, be it said with reverence, his death was a
Christmas gift to Heaven, for through the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and the sanctifying influence of the blessed spirit, we believe
he was made meet to be presented to the Father, in whose hands we leave
him.





A WORD TO OUR WORKERS

To lead a people long crushed by oppression away from the degradations
of slavery into a true and intelligent freedom, to teach those who have
no inheritance of steady purpose to rise into new habits of thought and
feeling, and away from the heredity of superstitions which were
unrelated with morality, into a faith which really purifies the heart
and the life, is not the work of a year, nor of fifty years. It means
patient continuance in well doing. It means consecration, responsibility
and self-sacrifice on the part of those who take upon themselves and
into themselves, the sins and the sorrows, and the struggles and
failures of those who are to be saved.

Nothing but a consecration that becomes a passion of the soul in
Christ's love and for Christ's sake, and an abiding faith in the triumph
of his kingdom of love and righteousness, will explain the earnestness
and labor of the devoted souls in our mission work, who are God's kings
and priests ministering to the lowly, and crowding their days with
service for those who have been the victims of the strong, and who, now
weak and poor, are despised in their poverty and weakness.

       *       *       *       *       *

All honor to those who are giving themselves to break down the
injustices of a cruel and unchristian caste, all honor to the noble men
and women who are working to rescue millions from the woeful inheritance
of centuries, as well as to save them from the dominion of the sin which
is common to man.

Others may honor Kings and Queens and Princes who have had their
greatness thrust upon them, but we will stand with those who accentuate
their reverence for lives consecrated to the good of humanity, who are
afflicted with the sorrows of God's poor, and oppressed with their
burdens, and whose prayers and songs are _God save the people_, Their
lives may not be chronicled in the pages which tell of those who lived
to make others serve them, but they are shining names upon God's Book of
Life, and in the day of the coronation of the nobility which God sees
and records, their names will stand out like radiant stars in the
heavens. One of such was JAMES POWELL, whose life was a grand sacrifice
of undeviating love for those whose necessities made him feel that he
was debtor to them, until he gave them the price of his life which
Christ had redeemed.

Subordinating himself to this consecration with incessant desire, he has
left his example which may well be inspiration and strength to all who
are working and praying for those who have been trodden under the feet
of the strong, and he has left his influence for tens of thousands.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the prophecy which foretold Christ, centuries before he came it was
written, "_He shall not fail, nor be discouraged_." Fellow workers, it
is not the consecration of a year, nor of a generation, that is to
restore the millions for whom we work to the places where God would
bring them. The pitiless centuries cannot be redeemed in one day.
Doubtless the work may seem slow and the time may seem long, but every
good deed counts, and no prayer is unheard. The good work is not in
vain. The progress already made is wonderful. The workers who have
consecrated themselves may die in their unfinished work, but God has
pledged himself that the work shall go on. His promises and his
providences will work together like cogs in a wheel. We shall not fail,
and we need not be discouraged. Such lives as that of JAMES POWELL are
not too common in human history, but they show us how the divine can
endue the human with its own power, and how God can make souls great
witnesses for God. Some tell us that the heroic ages have passed away,
but they have not. No! They will last until the world shall be saved,
for the inspirations which come from the spirit of God and from the
cross of Christ will live in hearts which will burn to save those who
need to be saved.

       *       *       *       *       *

Since the death of Dr. Powell, we have received numerous letters from
all parts of the country expressing sympathy in our great bereavement,
which the writers shared profoundly with us. The admiration and love
entertained by the writers, and uttered in these letters, toward our
beloved brother, is gratifying to us, as it is also to his family. In
the pressure of duties consequent upon his death and burial, we have not
found time to reply to these letters, and take this occasion to
acknowledge their receipt and to express our heartfelt thankfulness to
the writers.

       *       *       *       *       *

We shall not be able to make the stirring appeals to provide for the
exigent demands of our great work which our readers have been wont to
recognize as coming from the heart of Dr. Powell, who had the oversight
and burden of the collecting fields.

Never was our work more critical, never more urgent and never more
hopeful.

The winter months, on which we must chiefly rely, are here, and are fast
moving into the past. The work has been laid upon us and it would seem
faithless to our sacred trust to sacrifice any part of it. But we must
not take on a debt. We can only be saved from putting the knife to our
work or of trying to do what we cannot pay for, if the faithful pastors
of the churches will give their very present help. If the pastors who
believe in the work, which includes the education and salvation of the
needy among four races, will give their churches and Christian stewards
a good chance to know how great the cause is and what its honest appeals
are, we are confident that the Lord will deliver us from impending
trouble.


We will gladly furnish every pastor, and others who will send to us for
them, such facts and figures as may be helpful in representing the work.
Surely we can depend upon those who love God and their country for
thoughtful remembrance and ready response.

       *       *       *       *       *

The Rev. C.J. Ryder who has been assigned to the District Secretaryship
of the Eastern district for the collecting field in New England, will,
upon his return from a supervisory tour in the extreme South, succeed
our friend, Dr. Woodworth, in the Boston office.

It is well known to our readers that Superintendent Ryder, two and a
half years ago, was induced to assume the laborious work then demitted
by Rev. Dr. Roy upon a similar transfer of Dr. Roy from the Field
Superintendency to the District Secretaryship of the West, with his
office in Chicago. To those who have read the "Notes in the Saddle" from
the South, in our magazine, written by Supt. Ryder, we need add no word
of introduction. Nor need we say that he will carry into his new
department of our common work the same energy, zeal and interest which
has characterized the past. With his presentations of the work, and with
his personal knowledge and experience of the field, and of every part of
it, we anticipate for the new District Secretary a hearty welcome and
co-operation on the part of our pastors and churches. The work in the
South will be temporarily supervised, and arrangements have been made
for this by the New York office.

       *       *       *       *       *

In retiring from his long-time trust, the Rev. Dr. Woodworth bears with
him the thanks of multitudes of God's poor in the South, and the high
regard of all who have been associated in co-operative work with him. It
is not impossible that he may yet see his way to add to his record of
many years, still further service in another department of this varied
work.

       *       *       *       *       *

DEATH OF REV. WM. H. ELLIS.

Rev. William H. Ellis died Nov. 28th, at Troy, N.C., aged thirty-five
years and six months. He entered the work of the A.M.A. in North
Carolina in 1878 and continued in that field. At the time of his death
he was pastor of the Congregational Church and teacher of the
Association's school, at Troy, N.C. He was a graduate of Williams
College and continued his habits of study during the years of his
arduous labor as a missionary.

He had been for a long time in feeble health, but was unwilling to leave
his post of duty even temporarily to secure his recovery. His services
in this field of the A.M.A. have been characterized by self-denial,
patience and faithfulness. He was intensely loyal to his convictions and
died having fought the good fight, a Christian hero.

NOTES IN THE SADDLE

BY FIELD-SUPERINTENDENT C.J. RYDER.

I write these notes under the shadow of the great affliction that has
fallen upon the A.M.A. in the death of Dr. Powell. Although he was at the
head of another department of A.M.A. work, we always knew that we had in
him a kind and thoughtful friend, and one who would cordially co-operate
with the other officers in their far-reaching plans for the development
of the work, even though it added to his cares and burdens in gathering
the funds necessary to carry out these plans. We who have our work and
responsibilities in the field, no less than those who were in the office
with Dr. Powell, would bear our tribute of love, and scatter the
blossoms of holy memories upon this new-made grave.

       *       *       *       *       *

Two State Associations of unusual interest were held during the month of
November. The Central South Association met with the Trinity Church, in
Athens, Ala., Nov. 3d. This Association includes the churches of
Tennessee and two or three of those in Alabama. The reports from the
churches were very complete. Only one church in the Association was
without regular ministerial services, and that church had recently lost
its pastor by death. They are now supplied by a competent and faithful
minister. The temperance question was discussed with great enthusiasm.
The influence of Fisk University on the right side, during the recent
prohibition battle in Tennessee, can scarcely be over-estimated. Many
expressed the judgment that the argument of the Southern whites, that
the colored people defeated prohibition, was not true. One pastor
reported that his county went almost solidly against prohibition, and
there was only one colored man in the county, so far as he knew, and he
was a staunch prohibitionist. Some argued that while so many churches
and Women's Christian Temperance Unions and Young Men's Christian
Associations shut out respectable colored people, and saloons welcomed
those who were not respectable, it would be a difficult task for the
better class to induce the more ignorant to vote against those who
welcomed them and in favor of those who shut them out. Is there not
considerable force in their arguments?

A young colored man, who had been a preacher in one of the old churches
of the South and had become disgusted with its ignorance, superstition
and immorality, presented his credentials and applied for admission into
the Congregational Association of the State. This action of his is a
straw which shows which way the wind of religious thought blows among
the intelligent colored people of the South. The weather-vane points
toward Congregationalism. An aged pastor, who had endured ostracism and
violence in New York State in the early times, on account of his
anti-slavery opinions, was present during the meetings of the
Association, and added greatly to their interest. It was a thrilling
sight to him to look upon these colored brethren during their earnest
and often eloquent discussions, and to remember how much he had suffered
in their behalf in other days. Trinity School opened its doors wide and
offered generous hospitality to the pastors and delegates. On the whole,
it was one of the best meetings the Association has ever enjoyed.

The Congregational Association of the State of Georgia met with the
church at Macon, November 9th-14th. The church and its new pastor, a son
of Connecticut, did their utmost to make the meetings pleasant and
helpful. The band of earnest Christian teachers of Lewis Normal
Institute, the A.M.A. school at Macon, joined hands with the church and
pastor in helping to make the sessions of the Association profitable.
Here, too, as in the Central South Association, the temperance question
held a prominent place in the discussions. There was not a member of the
Association but was heartily in favor of prohibition. The Atlanta
campaign was on in all its heat and passion, and beseeching requests
were made by the delegates from that city that prayer might be offered
for them as they passed through the heat of this battle against
legalizing crime. Almost every church in the Association was represented
in this meeting and one new church applied for admission. This church
stands near the old prison pen of Andersonville and so the blood of the
martyrs proves the seed of the church, whether they wear the monk's cowl
of a Huss or the ragged blue of our country. The church at Charleston,
S.C., reported two missions just established in the destitute parts of
that city. All the churches in this Association assisted by the A.M.A.
are struggling towards self-support under helpful pressure from that
Society. I am glad to report that the church at Savannah has taken upon
itself the support of its pastor and local expenses for the next year.
The churches in this Association, although poor and often in serious
financial straits themselves, showed their appreciation of other lines
of Christian work by passing the following resolution:

     _Resolved,_ That in view of the financial embarrassments of the
     Home Missionary Society, the pastors of the churches urge upon
     their people the duty of taking up a collection for the benefit of
     that Society.

As illustrating the need of intelligent and decent church services in
the South, I record the following facts, which were related to me by
those who knew of them personally. A colored preacher of the "old-time"
sort preached on the Judgment Day. He held the meeting from evening till
well into the night. He arranged with a worthless fellow to hide himself
in the woods just outside the church, with a tremendously big
dinner-horn, with instructions to blow upon it at a certain signal. At
the awful hour of midnight, when, by entreaty and appeal and frightful
figures of speech, the preacher had worked the people up into a frenzy
of excitement and terror, he exclaimed, "Listen, I reckon I hear Gabriel
getting ready to blow now. De last day am on us, de judgment am right
here, whar you sinners now? Listen." And with bated breath they
listened. Just then there came a fearful blast on the stillness of the
midnight air, and the scene that followed can better be imagined than
described. Helter-skelter over the benches and over each other, the
terrified people scrambled for the mourners' bench. The preacher
boastfully told afterward, that "dar want scarsely one sinner but what
wah effected."

The quiet forms of worship in our Congregational churches, and the
intelligent preaching of the A.M.A. ministers, are fast bringing about a
state of things which will drive out such church circuses, with their
ministerial clowns. God speed the day!

During a considerable portion of the last month I have been "riding
double," as our honored Secretary, Dr. Beard, has been in the saddle
with me. His knowledge of the field, gained through these frequent
personal visits, is of great advantage to the work and highly
appreciated by the workers. We jogged together over many miles of
country, comparing notes, discussing plans and expressing our mutual
surprise at the wonderful and far-reaching work which is being
accomplished, and the prophetic glories of the future.

An account of the mountain campaign, through which Secretary Beard went
with me, will be the subject of future notes.

THE INDIANS.




WHAT AN INDIAN THINKS OF IT.

The writer of this letter is Loafer Redhorse, a son-in-law of the Titon
Chief, Swift Bear, whose band have colonized as homesteaders along the
Niobrara River near the mouth of Keya Paha River. Their colony is one
hundred and thirty miles from Rosebud Agency, to which they belong.
Their settlement we call Burrell Station in honor of Dea. Burrell, of
Oberlin, Ohio, who gave the money to build the school-house and home for
the teacher. Mr. Francis Frazier, son of Pastor Ehnamani of Santee, has
now been their teacher two years.

Loafer Redhorse is anything but a loafer. He is one of the most
industrious men. He is one who would naturally be first in war, as he
says, and now also is first in following the plow, and learning the ways
of the white man. Among other things it is interesting to know what he
thinks of prohibiting the use of the Dakota language.

MY FRIENDS: Let me speak now. I am sad because of one thing which I will
now speak of. Since our school-house (the Burrell station school) was
built, I, with my children, have attended with a glad heart just as if
it were my own. And now I hear that it is likely to be closed, and I
will speak about that. And this is why I have something to say. The
scholars who go out from the Brules to go to school, come back without
knowing anything, for the reason that they don't teach them anything
except to work. That is the reason they don't know anything, I think.

And I will tell how it was with us under Indian customs since the time I
had understanding. Then the Indian tribes were happy. Into whatever
country was good they roamed just as they pleased. At that time,
although there were many Indians on all sides, there was a great country
in between full of buffalo. It seemed to be the buffalo's country. And
the Indian people were made happy because of the buffalo. The people
would move their camps and pitch their tents again and the buffalo would
come right in among their tents with a great noise. Then it was that the
people had great joy.

And there was another thing that the people rejoiced in greatly. I will
speak of that also. That was in war. When they went to war and came near
the enemies' dwellings and saw the enemy there they would choose out
about ten of the bravest young men and dispatch them to kill some of the
enemy. Then they would draw near to the houses, and soon though there
might be five whose hearts were not able for it, the others would go on
and kill a man at his house. And the great joy that I spoke of was thus:
of the five who had killed an enemy but only four of them could take the
glory, but their names would be praised throughout the whole Indian
nation; they would be glorified and considered as chiefs. But most of
all, he who first killed the enemy he would be the chief. And then when
they had returned home even the women would rejoice greatly. They would
dance night and day, all of them. And as I, myself, was chief, I
considered this the very greatest joy. Such were our customs.

But now from the place I now occupy, I look back and remember these
things. And though the Indian people had all of these customs, I know
not one of them that made the people prosper or brought life to them. I
have not seen that brought life to the people. And thus from where I am
now, I am always looking to the future. On this account I am looking
forward. The Indians have been told the words of the Grandfather, (the
President). And they tell us that by these words the people will
prosper.

"Plant; by that you shall live," the Grandfather told them. And now I
know a little that the Grandfather spoke the truth. The Grandfather
gives me food for six days, but even though I eat a very little each
day, in three days I have eaten it all up. But now I have raised corn
and though I abide here eating nothing else, by it I live. And also to
go from my place to where the Grandfather gives me rations takes one
week to go and the same to come back and I stay over a few days to rest
when there, and so it altogether covers over three weeks or more.
Therefore, though I have settled here and desire to busy myself in all
the white man's ways that I am able, I have not yet become independent.
And therefore, I earnestly wish, if it were possible, that the
Grandfather would enable us to receive a year's rations at a time, and
then we would make speedy progress in the white man's way.

And because of this also, the children do not advance much in their
learning. For when we go after the food they also go along. If they
should stay behind, food is scarce, therefore they go along.

And now I hear it said that schooling in the Dakota language is to be
altogether stopped, and on this account I am sad. For in the
school-house here they learn well and also they pray. It is because they
do these things in the Dakota language that we have been brought to
understand them and to love them, and gladly live in accordance with
them. Then also if it was all done (the teaching and praying) by a white
man we would understand nothing about it, and so I do not think it would
be well.

And now this is the last thing I want to say. The Grandfather has for
his own the Indians all over the land, and he always helps them
according to what may be for their welfare. Now he is measuring off the
land for them, but I hear it said that he measures it very, very small,
and I am sad about that. If only he would have mercy and measure it off
for them largely, that is what I think. A good while ago the Grandfather
made a treaty with the Indians and promised to give them three hundred
and twenty acres, and according to that I have chosen my homestead and
that suits me. Therefore I prize the Grandfather's word and measure
myself by it. And thus I possess myself and my children.

Although we are not many people here, yet I always command them to give
heed to the words of the Grandfather. And I bear witness to their
constant attendance at the house (the school and church) that stands
here. Although I am wholly an Indian, yet these are my judgments and so
I tell them. And I write them in order that some may think about the
Indians. My friends, I wish you to hear these words and so I write them.
I shake hands with a good heart.

Miss Bertha Robertson, missionary of the A.M.A. from McIntosh, Ga., will
spend a few months in presenting our work in the North. She has just
completed a missionary tour in Maine, which has been most fruitful of
good, and will now give a few weeks to the churches of New Hampshire,
speaking to meetings of ladies, or to mixed audiences, as may be
desired. Applications for her services can be made to Miss Emerson, of
the Woman's Bureau, 56 Reade St., New York, or to Rev. Cyrus Richardson,
Nashua, N.H.

A teacher in the South writes:--"We have had a Merry Christmas trying to
make others happy. The people have never done so much for others before.
We found an old couple in very destitute circumstances, and asked the
school children if they would not like to do something for them. It was
very interesting to see them bring their gifts of a little sugar, meal,
flour, or an armful of wood, a potato, a little salt, whatever they
could get. It did them good. After our Christmas exercises at the
church, we took quite a number of the children around to see the old
people, and they sang their Christmas songs. I don't know which enjoyed
it most, the children or the old people.

Some young men of the Sunday-school paid a month's rent for a poor
woman. We are doing more than ever this year in getting the young people
to go and hold prayer meetings, or read to those who cannot get out to
church."

FOR THE CHILDREN.

HOW SUSY WENT TO TOUGALOO.

You never could guess just how she went, if you should try from now
until your next birthday, so I'll tell you first how she came to go to
Tougaloo at all.

To begin with, Mamma Bradley had been rummaging about in the attic a
long time, when little Fay set out to find her.

"What are you doing up here, mamma?" said Fay. "I've been hunting for
you ever so long."

"Oh, I'm looking for some things to put in the barrel that is going to
Tougaloo for the poor people that the missionaries are working for."

"Clothes?" said Fay.

"Yes, clothes, and I suppose they would be glad of almost anything that
would help to make their lives more comfortable," said her mother.

Fay sat down in an old basket and watched her mother fold and unfold the
contents of trunks and boxes so quietly, that Mrs. Bradley finally
looked up and said:

"Why don't you go to your play, dear? What are you thinking about?"

"I was thinking," said Fay, "do you s'pose the Tougaloo folks have any
little girls?"

"Oh, yes, plenty of them."

"Big's me?"

"Yes, all sizes, I suppose," said Mrs. Bradley, going on with her work.

"Well," said Fay, "I was thinking, how d'you s'pose they'd like Susy?"

"What! the new dolly that Auntie gave you for keeping your elbows off
the table?"

"Yes'm," said Fay. "Do you s'pose she'd make a little Tougaloo girl's
life any more comfor'ble?"

"Why, yes, dear, anything that gives you so much pleasure would please
them, of course," said her mother, "but are you quite sure you want to
give Susy away?"

"Well, when Auntie gave us our missionary boxes in the Sunday-school
class, she told us to be sure and remember what was printed on them, and
she read on one side something about people giving their first fruits,
and she said it meant their best things, and on top it said, 'Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, ye have done it unto
me.' Now Susy is my best doll--any way I love her best, and there
couldn't be anybody much leaster than a little girl like me way down in
Tougaloo, could there, mamma?"

"Well, you must think it all over, and if you are quite sure that you
want to do it, we will take Susy down to the church this afternoon with
the other things," said her mother.

Fay said no more, and in a few minutes she tripped down stairs, and when
her mamma followed soon after, she heard the creak of Fay's little
rocking chair, and the words, "Sleep, baby, sleep," which told her as
she peeped through a crack in the door, that Susy was getting her last
lullaby from the fond little mother, who at the proper time presented
Susy all dressed for her journey to Tougaloo.

"When Fay and her mother arrived at the church, sure enough right there
in the parlor stood two or three barrels, while dear old Mrs. Rogers and
half a dozen other ladies were filling them with useful articles.

"Here is a package of clothing," said Mrs. Bradley, " and I have another
bundle, which Dennis will bring from the carriage in a few minutes."

"And Susy's going to Tougaloo," said Fay, reaching out her treasure to
Grandma Rogers as she spoke.

"Well now, the dear," said Grandma Rogers, "don't you want her yourself,
blossom?"

"No'm, not now," said Fay, "if you'll find a little girl who'll take
real good care of her--her name's 'Susy.'"

"Well, did you ever!" said Grandma Rogers. " Here's jest the place for
Susy, she can set right here in Miss Blout's bunnit as snug as a bug."

"Wait a minute, Mrs. Rogers," said Miss Bliss, and taking a pencil she
wrote on a little slip of paper, "My name is Susy, and I should like to
go to some little girl who will take good care of me." This she read and
pinned the slip on Susy's pretty dress when she was safely seated in
"Miss Blout's bunnit," in which odd carriage, made of roses and ribbons,
Susy started on her long journey to Tougaloo. Her little mother, Fay,
would like some day to get a letter from Susy's new mother, though she
has not yet heard from her.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
