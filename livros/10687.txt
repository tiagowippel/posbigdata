INTRODUCTION


ALPHONSE DAUDET

(_N�mes, May 13, 1840; Paris, December 16, 1897_)

Alphonse Daudet was born in the ancient Proven�al city of N�mes, near the
Rh�ne, May 13, 1840. In this same year �mile Zola, destined like Daudet to
pass his youth in Provence, was born at Paris.

As a result of the commercial upheaval which attended the revolution of
1848, Daudet's father, a wealthy silk manufacturer, was ruined. After a
hard struggle he was forced to give up his business at N�mes and moved to
Lyons (1849). He was not successful here, and finally, in 1856, the family
was broken up. The sons now had to shift for themselves.

These first sixteen years of Alphonse Daudet's life were far from unhappy.
He had found delight in exploring the abandoned factory at N�mes. His
school days at Lyons were equally agreeable  to the young vagabond. His
studies occupied him little; he loved to wander through the streets of the
great city, finding everywhere food for fanciful speculation. He would
follow a person he did not know, scrutinizing his every movement, and
striving to lose his own identity in that of the other, to live the
other's life. His frequent days of truancy he spent in these idle rambles,
or in drifting down the river. Literary ambition had already seized him;
he had written a novel (of which no trace remains) and numerous verses.
Notwithstanding his lack of application to study, he had succeeded in
completing the course of the _lyc�e_.

In 1856 when it became certain that the father could no longer care for
the family, the mother and daughter took refuge in the home of relatives;
Ernest, the older of the two surviving sons, sought his fortune in the
literary circles of Paris; and Alphonse accepted a position as "master of
the study hall" (_ma�tre d'�tudes, pion_) at the college of Alais in the
C�vennes. The boy was too young, too delicate, and too sensitive to be
able to endure the mental suffering and humiliation to which he was
subjected at the hands of the bullies of this school.[1] After a year of
martyrdom he set out on his terrible journey to Paris. Here he was
welcomed by his brother Ernest.

[Footnote 1: See "Le Petit Chose," "Little What's-His-Name."]

The two brothers had always felt and always continued to feel the closest
sympathy for each other. Ernest believed in Alphonse's genius more than in
his own, and bestowed on his younger brother the motherly devotion which
Alphonse so gratefully  and tenderly acknowledges in "Le Petit Chose," his
romantic autobiography, where Ernest appears as "ma m�re Jacques."

The first years in Paris were the darkest in the brothers' lives. They
could earn scarcely enough to satisfy their most pressing needs, but both
were happy, since they were in Paris. Before Alphonse's arrival Ernest had
secured regular employment on a newspaper. Alphonse was longing for
recognition as a poet, but to earn his living he was forced to turn to
prose. His contributions to _Le Figaro_ and other newspapers soon made him
known. He wrote little and carefully, nor did he forget his literary
ideals even when poverty might have excused hurried productions in the
style best calculated to sell. His literary conscience was as strong under
the trying circumstances of his debut as later when success brought
independence.[2]

[Footnote 2: See E. Daudet, "_Mon Fr�re et moi_," pp. 151-152. Daudet
frequently says of himself that he was by nature an improviser, that the
labor of meticulous composition to which he forced himself was a torture,
yet he remained always true to his ideal.]

During this period he lived among the Bohemians of the Parisian world of
letters; but, though he shared their joys and sorrows, he seems to have
emerged unscathed from the dangers of such an existence. Zola met Daudet
at this time and has left us an attractive picture of him: "He was in the
employ of a successful newspaper, he used to bring in his article, receive
his remuneration, and disappear with the nonchalance of a young god, sunk
in poetry, far from the petty cares of this world. He was living, I think,
outside of the city, in a remote corner with other poets, a band of joyous
Bohemians. He was beautiful, with the delicate, nervous beauty of an
Arabian horse, an ample mane, a silky divided beard, large eyes, a thin
nose, a passionate mouth, and, to crown all that, a certain flash of
light, a breath of tender voluptuousness, which bathed his whole face in a
smile that was both roguish and sensual. There was in him something of the
Parisian Street gamin and something of the Oriental woman."[1]

[Footnote 1: "Les Romanciers naturalistes," pp. 256-257.]

Daudet's first volume was a collection of verse, "Les Amoureuses" (1858,
published by Tardieu, a Proven�al). These simple poems are charming in
their freshness and na�vet�, and established Daudet's reputation as a
writer of light verse. The whole volume, and especially "Les Prunes,"
attracted the attention of the Empress Eug�nie. At her solicitation Daudet
was made one of the secretaries of the powerful Duke of Morny, president
of the _corps l�gislatif_ (1860). His duties were purely nominal. He now
had money enough to keep the wolf from his door and was free to devote
himself to literature.

It was at this time that the stage began to attract him. His first play,
"La Derni�re Idole," was produced at the Od�on in 1862. Almost every other
year between 1862 and 1892 a new play, on untried themes, or adapted from
one of his novels and usually written in collaboration, appeared at a
Parisian theater. Of all these only one, "L'Arl�sienne" (1872), is worthy
of its author.

Already in 1859, as a result of the suffering of the preceding years and
lack of precautions, his health had begun to fail. He spent the winters of
1861-1864 in Algeria, Corsica, and Provence.  These voyages were of vital
importance in his development.  He learned something of the world and
became better fitted to study conditions in his own narrow sphere; at the
same time he acquired the power of vigorous description and collected
material for some of his finest short stories and for the Tartarin series.

A portion of the summer of 1861 he dreamed away in an abandoned mill[1]
near Fontvieille, between Tarascon and Arles. From here he sent to the
Parisian newspapers _L'Ev�nement_ and _Le Figaro_ those delightful stories
and sketches which were gathered and published in 1869 under the title
"Lettres de mon moulin." Of all the many volumes of Daudet's collected
works this is the most satisfying: it is here that the distinctive
products of his genius are to be sought; and it is on these stories, with
a few from later collections, and on "Tartarin de Tarascon," that his
claim to immortality will finally rest. It is here that we find several of
his most excellent stories: "Le Secret de ma�tre Cornille", "La Ch�vre de
M. Seguin", "La Mule du pape", "Le Cur� de Cucugnan", "L'�lixir du
r�v�rend p�re Gaucher" and others.

[Footnote 1: Daudet did not live in the mill which he has made famous, but
he spent there "de longues journ�es"; he never owned it, but the deed
which serves so picturesquely as preface to his book is not entirely
apocryphal. See "Trente Ans de Paris," p. 164.]

In 1865, at the death of Morny, he gave up his secretaryship and applied
himself exclusively to literature.

In 1866 he met Julie Allard, and early the next year they were married. To
his wife, a lady of exquisite taste, Daudet owed unfailing encouragement
and competent, sympathetic criticism.

"Le Petit Chose," his first long work, had been begun in 1866 during his
stay in Provence; it was published in 1868. The first part, which is of
great interest, is largely autobiographical and covers the childhood and
youth of the writer up to his first years in Paris; the second part is a
colorless romance of no particular merit. Daudet himself confessed that
the work had been written too soon and with too little reflection. "I wish
I had waited," he said; "something good might have been written on my
youth".[1]

[Footnote 1: See "Trente Ans de Paris," pp. 75, 85, and Sherard, "Alphonse
Daudet," p. 301.]

"Tartarin de Tarascon" was written in 1869.

Success and happiness had crowned Daudet's efforts. He was spending his
time in all tranquility, now at Paris, now at Champrosay, where he
occupied the house of the painter Delacroix. Suddenly in July, 1870, the
war cloud burst. Daudet lay stretched out on his bed fretfully nursing a
broken leg. On his recovery he shouldered his gun and joined in the
hopeless defense of Paris.

It was the war that killed the old Daudet and brought into existence the
new. Before the war, Daudet himself confesses it, he had lived free from
care, singing and trifling, heedless of the vexing problems of society and
the world, his heart aglow with the fire of the sun of his native
Provence. The war awakened in our sensitive poet a seriousness of purpose
which harmonized but little with his native genius. Among his friends he
never lost his old-time buoyant gaiety; but his works from now on show
only a trace of it. The charming "Belle-Nivernaise" (1886), a few
"tarasconades," a gleam here and there in all his works, remind us of our
old friend and plead for our sympathy with the new.

During the next few years he added to his reputation as a writer of short
stories; to this period belong several collections of tales and sketches:
"Lettres � un absent" (1871), "Contes du lundi" (1873), "Les Femmes
d'artistes" (1874), "Robert Helmont" (1874). A few of the stories are
still more or less in the manner of the "Lettres de mon moulin" ("Le Pape
est mort," "Un R�veillon dans le marais," "Les �motions d'un perdreau
rouge"), but all these volumes, except "Les Femmes d'artistes," are
inspired by the war. The playfulness of the youthful Daudet is still
apparent here and there in the war stories ("La Pendule de Bougival," "Les
Petits P�t�s"), but a sterner tone is prevalent.

The great novels which now follow are the fruit of meditation, the
ripening process which the war precipitated, and which was fed from the
flame of Flaubert, Goncourt, Zola, and others. Neglecting almost entirely
those elements of his genius which came to him as his birthright, he
devotes himself henceforth to a study of the problems of life. Our
Proven�al cicada has a purpose now: nothing else than the reformation of
all social abuses. He does not single out one and attack it time after
time, but he springs restlessly from one to another, directing high and
low his relentless inquiry.

"Fromont jeune et Risler a�n�" (1874) is the first of Daudet's great
novels and one of his strongest studies. Sidonie, the daughter of humble
bourgeois parents, is filled with a longing for luxury and social
prominence. She succeeds in becoming the wife of Fromont, a simple, honest
workman whose talent and industry have brought him wealth. Sidonie's
unscrupulousness in the pursuit of her object spreads ruin. Risler, the
partner of Fromont, withdraws large sums from the common treasury to
satisfy the extravagant desires of Sidonie whom he loves. Fromont's  eyes
are at last opened; he finds the firm, which had always been his pride, on
the verge of bankruptcy; he discovers the perfidy of Sidonie and attempts
to force her to beg on her knees the forgiveness of Risler's
long-suffering wife. Sidonie flees and becomes a concert-hall singer. Her
revenge is complete when by means of a letter she proves to Fromont that
she has corrupted his much-loved younger brother. Fromont hangs himself.

Outside the main current of the plot Daudet sketches one of the little
dramas of humble life of which he was so fond: the story of Delobelle, an
impoverished actor who lives for his art while his devoted wife and
daughter D�sir�e patiently ply the needle to earn bread.

Daudet up to this time had been recognized as the greatest of French
short-story writers. The success of "Fromont jeune et Risler a�n�" was
immediate, and in his succeeding novels he confirmed more and more surely
his right to a place in the front rank of French novelists.

From this story of the life of the _petite bourgeoisie_ he turns to a
wider field. The Bohemia of Paris, a glimpse of the country, and
especially the life of the artisan, fill "Jack" (1876). Daudet had known
the real Jack at Champrosay in 1868. In the novel Jack is the illegitimate
son of Ida de Barency, a shallow demi-mondaine who is passionately devoted
to the boy but brings to him nothing but misfortune. Jack begins his
suffering in a wretched school where his mother has placed him after the
Jesuits had refused to receive him. This school is supported by the
tuition fees of boys from tropical countries, _petits pays chauds_, as
Moronval, the villainous director, calls them. The teachers belong to that
class of _rat�s_, artistic and literary failures, whom Daudet learned to
know well during his first years in Paris. One of these _rat�s_ captivates
Ida de Barency, and Jack's life of misery continues. Despite his physical
unfitness, he is sent to labor in the shipbuilding yards at Indret,
suffers tortures in the stoking room of an ocean steamer, is wrecked, and
returns to France in a piteous condition. His love for C�cile,
granddaughter of a gentle country doctor, is rapidly making a man of him,
when his mother enters again into his life and the poor boy dies miserably
in a hospital, killed by despair rather than by disease.

This is perhaps the most powerful of Daudet's novels; it is certainly the
most harrowing. The tragedy of the whole is only slightly relieved by the
interweaving of the romance of good B�lisaire, the hawker, one of Jack's
few friends.

"Le Nabab" (1878) is concerned with politics, the richer bourgeoisie, and
the aristocracy. Jansoulet, the "nabob," returns from Tunis with a large
fortune and immediately becomes the prey of parasites. He is made the
enemy of the banker Hemerlingue through the social rivalry of their wives.
He is elected _d�put�_ from Corsica. The legality of the election is
questioned. Jansoulet is supported by the prime minister, the duc de Mora,
but the latter dies suddenly, Jansoulet's election is declared invalid,
and he dies from a stroke of apoplexy.

Despite the protest of the author, contemporaries found originals for a
number of the characters of this novel. The duc de Mora is Morny, and
several others have been identified with greater or less certainty.
F�licia Ruys is perhaps Sarah Bernhardt.

The purely romantic element of the work is found in the story of Paul de
G�ry and the Joyeuse family, a secondary plot having no vital connection
with the main story.

In "Les Rois en exil" (1880) Daudet explores a new vein in contemporary
society. He explains that the idea of the work occured to him one October
evening when, standing in the Place du Carrousel, he was contemplating the
ruins of the Tuileries. The wreck of the Empire brought to his mind a
vision of the dethroned monarchs whom he had seen spending their exile in
Paris: the Duke of Brunswick, the blind King of Hanover and the devoted
Princess Frederica, Queen Isabella of Spain, and others. "This is the work
which cost me most effort," Daudet says, and the reason is not far to
seek. He had always painted "from life," and the difficulties incident to
gaining an entrance into the intimacy of even dethroned monarchs were
almost insurmountable. The novelist's acquaintances were appealed to, from
house-furnishers to diplomats. The story of the composition of "Les Rois
en exil" is an interesting study of Daudet's methods, his inexorable
insistence on truth, even to the most minute details.

As usual, the characters are sharply contrasted. Christian, the exiled
king of Illyria, is detestably weak; Fr�d�rique, his wife devoting herself
completely to the interests of her son, Zara, struggles with the aid of
the faithful preceptor, M�raut, to prepare the prince for a throne which
he is never to ascend. Of all the characters that appear in Daudet's
novels it is perhaps Fr�d�rique whose appeal to the reader is strongest,
and Fr�d�rique is almost entirely the product of the author's imagination.
We cannot but regret the many visions such as Fr�d�rique which were
refused admittance to Daudet's essentially romantic mind by the
uncompromising laws of a realism which he had mistakenly accepted as his
guide.

The composition of "Les Rois en exil" is defective, but its charm is
great. In "Numa Roumestan" (1881) the technique is better. Daudet's first
intention was to entitle this work "Nord et midi," his idea being to
contrast the north with the south, a theme for which he always had a
predilection. Numa is a refined Tartarin; Daudet sends him to Paris, and
studies the result. Numa carries all before him by his robust vigor and
geniality. The "mirage" effects of the southern sun pursue him to Paris;
quick to promise out of the fullness of his hearty enthusiasm, he
encourages and disappoints those who trust themselves to him. He deceives
his wife, begs her forgiveness with abundant tears, and in a disgusting
manner deceives her a second time. The book ends with the picture of
Rosalie Roumestan bending over her new-born son. "Will you be a liar too?"
She asks. "Will you be a Roumestan, tell me?"

"L'�vang�liste" (1883), a psychological study rather than a novel, is a
heartbreaking picture of the inhumanity of religious fanaticism. "Sapho"
(1884) is so essentially French in spirit that it can hardly be understood
by American readers. Daudet dedicates it "To my sons when they are
twenty." It is intended as a lesson, and if naturalistic works ever can
carry a lesson this one certainly does. It is a striking picture of the
evils of _faux m�nages_. On the whole "Sapho" is disagreeable, yet of the
novels it seems to be Daudet's masterpiece, perhaps because it is the most
romantic.  The truth may be photographed in its most minute realistic
details, as in Zola, or it may be colored by poetic fancy; this has
happened in "Numa Roumestan" and especially in "Sapho," the two novels of
Daudet which appear most likely to live. In "Sapho" there is a tender note
which is lacking in "Jack" and in "Fromont jeune et Risler a�n�"; Daudet's
nature fitted him to inspire pity rather than indignation. And we must
remember that while writing "Sapho" he had in mind the future of his own
sons. He looks forward, and in hope of a fortunate issue tells frankly, in
a kindly manner, a true story  which he hopes may be fruitful of good
results. If, instead of assuming the role of inquisitorial censor,
naturalists would show sympathy for erring mankind, if they would look
forward with hope instead of fixing their horrified eyes on the present or
the past, their judgments would not tend to make us give up in despair,
but might encourage and instruct. "Sapho" is the last of the great novels.

"L'Immortel" (1888) is a weak and unjust satire directed against the
French Academy. "Rose et Ninette" (1892) is a study of the evils of
divorce; "La Petite Paroisse" (1895), the only one of the novels with a
happy outcome, is a study of jealousy.  In "Soutien de famille" (1898,
posthumous) two brothers are contrasted; the older, as a matter of course
recognized as the head of the family, is weak, and the younger is the real
"prop of the family."

Just after "Sapho" (1884) Daudet's health had begun to decline. Long years
of suffering follow, but, although in almost constant pain, the
indefatigable worker remains at his desk.

In "Souvenirs d'un homme de lettres" (1888) and "Trente Ans de Paris"
(1888) Daudet tells the story of his life and literary activity. It is
through these works that we become intimately acquainted with our author,
and we are not disillusioned. "Entre les frises et la rampe" (1893)
contains studies of the stage and its people.


       *       *       *       *       *


Daudet claimed to be an independent,[1] and was indignant when an attempt
was made to class him with any school. He was certainly independent in his
youth, but in his second period, after the war, he became a realist with
Flaubert and Zola and an impressionist with Goncourt.

[Footnote 1: He consistently refused to have his name placed in candidacy
before the Academy. In a foreword prefixed to "L'Immortel" he declares:
"Je ne me pr�sente pas, je ne me suis jamais pr�sent�, je ne me
pr�senterai jamais � l'Acad�mie."]

It is, however, the southerner in Daudet that remains most pleasing. It is
in those works which are directly inspired by his native land of dreams
that he is most completely himself, and therefore most charming. It is
here that he discloses his kinship with Musset. With all the delicacy of
Musset and at the same time a saneness which Musset did not always
possess, what might he not have accomplished if he had only continued as
he began? Even as it is, the best Daudet is the young Daudet, the brother
of Musset. In his so-called great works, the long novels where questions
of the day are fearlessly treated yet never solved, the works which are
frequently considered his surest claim to immortality, we have an entirely
different Daudet, excellent of course, and strong too if you like, but not
the Daudet that nature had intended to produce.

Surely it would have been better if he had never gone to Paris, but, like
his friend Mistral, had remained in Provence and devoted his essentially
poetic genius to an expression of the spirit of the south. His keenly
sensitive nature was too delicate for intercourse with the virility of a
Zola or the subtlety of a Goncourt. Paris made of him a realist, and the
world lost by the transformation.

Daudet's love for his native land was intense. Its images were ever
present to him; its poetry haunted him throughout his life. He urged young
men ambitious of literary laurels to remain in their native provinces, to
draw their inspiration from the soil, confident that something great and
beautiful would result. Why did he not take for himself the counsel he so
incessantly offered to others? An untiring curiosity which accompanied a
remarkable acuteness of all the senses, and an emotional and intellectual
receptivity which rendered him quickly and profoundly  impressionable,
equipped Daudet to express the poetic spirit of the south in its epic as
well as its lyric qualities. He was aware of this himself. "I believe that
I shall carry away with me," he said, "many curious observations on my
race, its virtues, its faults".[1] And in speaking of the "Lettres de mon
moulin," the only volume of his works in which his southern nature is
given free rein, he says many years after its publication, after he had
written his best novels, "That is still my favorite book."

[Footnote 1: L�on Daudet, "Alphonse Daudet," p. 183; read the whole
chapter. "En lisant Eug�nie de Gu�rin, je m'�crie: 'Pourquoi n'avoir pas
tous v�cu chez nous, dans nos coins?' Comme nos esprits y auraient gagn�
au point de vue de l'originalit� au sens �tymologique du mot, c'est-�-dire
vertu d'origine."--"Notes sur la vie," p. 141.]

Daudet's remarkable power of observation was innate. From his youth he
exercised this instinct and carried a notebook in which he set down
impressions, studies, and sketches of characters  and scenes. These
notebooks proved to be of inestimable value to the realist; and the
natural inclination to seek the naked truth, to which they bear witness,
strengthened the determination of the postbellum Daudet to enter the ranks
of the sociological novelists. So far as possible, he borrowed every
detail of character and environment from real life; almost all his
characters represent real persons whom he studied with a view of using
them in his books. Daudet's is a microscopic, notebook realism quite
different from the universal verity of Balzac, but there are many pages
prompted by an exquisite sympathy or a violent passion in which the
indomitable personality of the author breaks through the impassiveness
imposed by the accepted masters of the craft. Sadness is the prevailing
tone in his work, the sort of sadness that proceeds from pity. Where
sadness does not dominate in Daudet, irony takes its place. These two
qualities, sadness which is inspired by pity for human suffering and irony
which betrays impatience with human folly, these two qualities which are
the heart and soul of Daudet's work are the enemies of that impassiveness
which is the indispensable attitude of the realist, and which Daudet tried
in vain to acquire.

Paris, the war, his intercourse with Flaubert and Goncourt and Zola, were
the influences, then, that transformed Daudet, most easily susceptible to
impressions from without. The Daudet of the great novels is not the real
Daudet, however; the real Daudet is the author of "Les Amoureuses," of the
"Lettres de mon moulin," and of "Tartarin de Tarascon."

But even in the "Tartarin" series he is not entirely himself. The pure
stream of his native simplicity and na�vet� is already  tinged with the
worldly-wiseness of the Parisian. In the "Lettres de mon moulin" the
writer is still in sympathy with his native land, while in the earliest of
the "Tartarin" series, "Tartarin de Tarascon," there is already a spirit
of disdainful raillery which Daudet learned in Paris. Tarascon was piqued
when "Tartarin de Tarascon" appeared. Indeed, there is more than a little
in the book that may well offend local pride.

In "Numa Roumestan" the satire is still less sympathetic and less
good-natured. Numa is utterly detestable. He is a visionary; we readily
forgive such a weakness, and we are amused by this characteristic trait of
the south in Bompard and Tartarin. These two are visionaries and liars;
they are cowards too, boastful and conceited. But they have never had the
happiness of others in their hands. If a true child of the south, such as
Tartarin or Bompard, were placed in a position of trust, he would not
prove equal to the occasion and the result would be a Numa Roumestan. That
is Daudet's verdict, and certainly his decision is not flattering to the
south. Is this the decision of the better Daudet? is it not a Parisian
Daudet, whose sympathy for his native land has been warped by the play of
Parisian mockery on his sensitive, easily convinced nature?

It is precisely in "Numa Roumestan," where he is making his most complete
study of the character of the southerner, that Daudet is most pessimistic.
Le Quesnoy, the worthy northerner, deceives his wife as does Numa, the
lying southerner. The spirit of the novel is epitomized in such sentiments
as "Joie de rue, douleur de maison," "Au nord au midi--tous pareils,
tra�tres et parjures," "Grand homme pour tout le monde except� pour sa
femme." A decided pessimism pervades the great novels. Optimistic  Daudet
is frequently said to be. He was truly so by nature, he is so in the
"Lettres de mon moulin" and in all his work before the war, but his
pessimism is unquestionable in the great novels.

Surely nature did not intend Daudet to become a pessimist; he loved
mankind, he had many devoted friends and no enemies. He carried happiness
wherever he went. The attic of Auteuil, the rendezvous of the Goncourt
group, is dark and gloomy. A serious, mirthless band surrounds the
armchair of the patriarch. The door opens and Daudet enters. Old Goncourt
rises to greet him: "Eh bien! mon petit, �a va?" "Assez bien, mon
Goncourt" is the reply. The terrible malady has already seized the younger
man, but he still radiates life and cheer: his lightness of heart dispels
the gravity of the company; little by little his animation is communicated
to them all, and the attic resounds with peals of laughter.

It was always so. The sympathy of Daudet, the man, was unfailing; his pity
For the weak, his love for his family and friends, his hatred of villainy,
were boundless. He delighted in little acts of charity the source of which
remained unknown to the world and even to the recipient.

"My father said to me again and again," L�on Daudet tells us, "I should
like, after I have accomplished my task, to set myself up as a merchant of
happiness. My reward would be in my success!" This longing, so entirely
characteristic of the man, is manifest everywhere in his earlier work,
only rarely in the great novels; unfortunately the great novels were his
"task."

If only he had continued as he began, if only he had remained the poet of
the "Lettres de mon moulin"; if only he had not been led astray by his
"task," he might have brought to the world of readers that happiness which
he brought to his few friends in the attic of Auteuil.


       *       *       *       *       *


We are told the story of the publication of "Tartarin de Tarascon" [1] by
Daudet himself in his "Trente Ans de Paris." It began to appear in the
_Petit Moniteur universel_, but did not appeal to the readers of this
popular newspaper.

[Footnote 1: The other books of the "Tartarin" series are inferior to
"Tartarin de Tarascon" (1872). "Tartarin sur les Alpes" (1885) relates the
adventures of the hero while climbing the great mountains of Switzerland
in order to prove that he is worthy of remaming P.C.A. (_Pr�sident du Club
Alpin de Tarascon._) In "La D�fense de Tarascon" (1886, only a dozen pages
long) we have a characteristic picture of the city preparing to resist the
German invasion. "Port-Tarascon" (1890) is the last and poorest of the
series. Tartarin leads his compatriots in a colonizing expedition to the
South Seas, and then brings them home again. Finally, in self-inflicted
exile, "across the bridge" in Beaucaire (cf. note to _13_ 28), the great
man dies.]

Publication was interrupted after some ten installments, and the work was
carried to the _Figaro_, by whose more aristocratic clientele literary
irony was not unappreciated. The hero was first called _Chapatin_, then
_Barbarin_ (cf. note to _56_ 12), and finally _Tartarin_. "Tartarin de
Tarascon" is a _gal�jado, une plaisanterie, un �clat de rire_. Continuing
Daudet says: "Only one who was raised in southern France, or knows it
thoroughly, can appreciate how frequently the Tartarin type is to be met
there, and how under the generous sun of Tarascon, which warms and
electrifies, the natural drollery of mind and imagination is led astray
into monstrous exaggerations, in form and dimension as various as bottle
gourds."

Daudet, like our Dickens, succeeded in producing characters invested with
such reality that in the minds of readers they become veritable beings. Of
all his creations Tartarin is the most widely known, and the world's
conception of a French southerner is derived from the portrait of this
hero.

As is usual in the works of Daudet, the character of Tartarin is not
wholly fictitious. The home of the cap-hunters was really not Tarascon,
but a village five or six leagues away on the other side of the Rh�ne. It
was from this village, and in company with the prototype of Tartarin, that
Daudet set out for Africa in 1861, chiefly to recover his health and
incidentally to hunt lions. The novel is a souvenir of the author's
sojourn in the home of the real Tartarin and of the trip which the two
made together[1], the whole being greatly modified by the play of the
novelist's Proven�al imagination.

[Footnote 1: See the following notes of this edition for evidence of the
extent to which Daudet used the notes jotted down in Africa in the
composition of "Tartarin": _70_ 21, _73_ 27, _81_ 5-6. See also "Souvenirs
d'un homme de lettres," p. 44, where he speaks of the notebook from which
he extracted "Tartarin" and other works.]

To appreciate "Tartarin de Tarascon" is not easy for a foreigner; and by
foreigners is meant all those who have not lived in and do not know
Provence. Americans and Parisians (see pages 16-17) look on Tartarin and
his compatriots as mere liars.

They are not liars: they are suffering simply from the effects of a
mirage. To understand what is meant by a mirage, you must go to the south
of France. There you will find a magic sun which transforms everything,
which takes a molehill and makes of it a mountain. Go to Tarascon, seek
out a man who almost went to Shanghai, look steadfastly at him, and if the
southern sun is shining upon him you will soon be convinced that he has
actually gone to Shanghai.

In reading "Tartarin de Tarascon," therefore, remember that Tartarin's
world is small and his imagination large; that he never lies, though he
rarely tells the truth. Do not make the mistake of thinking Tartarin a
lunatic. Just as his immortal predecessor Don Quixote was thoroughly sane
except in that which touched the realm of chivalry, so Tartarin is a
normal Frenchman except when he is under the influence of the southern
mirage.


       *       *       *       *       *


Daudet says in "Trente Ans de Paris," page 142, that the home of the real
Tartarin was five or six miles from Tarascon on the other side of the
Rhone. In an article which appeared in "Les Annales," July 6, 1913,
Charles Le Goffic tells of a visit to the house in Tarascon known as _la
maison de Tartarin_, and reports a conversation he had with Mistral, the
great Proven�al poet, an intimate friend of Daudet. Mistral said that the
real Tartarin lived at N�mes, eighteen miles from Tarascon, to the west of
the Rhone, and was no other than Raynaud, Daudet's own cousin. "Raynaud,"
Mistral told Le Goffic, "had travelled among the _Teurs_ and talked about
nothing but his lion hunts; he talked about them with his lower lip
extended so as to form a terrible pout (_moue_), which gave a character of
good-natured ferocity to the little gentleman's honest face.
Raynaud recognized himself in Tartarin and became very angry with Daudet;
the reconciliation between the cousins was not effected till toward the
end of the novelist's life."

TARTARIN DE TARASCON


_En France tout le monde
est un peu de Tarascon_.



PREMIER �PISODE



A TARASCON

I

Le jardin du baobab.


Page 1

Ma premi�re visite � Tartarin de Tarascon est rest�e dans
ma vie comme une date inoubliable; il y a douze ou quinze ans
de cela, mais je m'en souviens mieux que d'hier. L'intr�pide
Tartarin habitait alors, � l'entr�e de la ville, la troisi�me maison
[5]� main gauche sur le chemin d'Avignon. Jolie petite villa tarasconnaise
avec jardin devant, balcon derri�re, des murs tr�s
blancs, des persiennes vertes, et sur le pas de la porte une
nich�e de petits Savoyards jouant � la marelle ou dormant au
bon soleil, la t�te sur leurs bo�tes � cirage.

[10]Du dehors, la maison n'avait l'air de rien.

Jamais on ne se serait cru devant la demeure d'un h�ros.
Mais quand on entrait, coquin de sort!...

De la cave au grenier, tout le b�timent avait l'air h�ro�que,
m�me le jardin!...

[15]O le jardin de Tartarin, il n'y en avait pas deux comme celui-l� en
Europe. Pas un arbre du pays, pas une fleur de France;
rien que des plantes exotiques, des gommiers, des calebassiers,
des cotonniers, des cocotiers, des manguiers, des bananiers, des

Page 2.

palmiers, un baobab, des nopals, des cactus, des figuiers de
Barbarie, � se croire en pleine Afrique centrale, � dix mille lieues
de Tarascon. Tout cela, bien entendu, n'�tait pas de grandeur
naturelle; ainsi les cocotiers n'�taient gu�re plus gros que des
[5]betteraves, et le baobab (_arbre g�ant, arbos gigantea_) tenait �
l'aise dans un pot de r�s�da; mais c'est �gal! pour Tarascon
c'�tait d�j� bien joli, et les personnes de la ville, admises le
dimanche � l'honneur de contempler le baobab de Tartarin, s'en
retournaient pleines d'admiration.

[10]Pensez quelle �motion je dus �prouver ce jour-l� en traversant
ce jardin mirifique!... Ce fut bien autre chose quand on
m'introduisit dans le cabinet du h�ros.

Ce cabinet, une des curiosit�s de la ville, �tait au fond du
jardin, ouvrant de plain-pied sur le baobab par une porte
[15]vitr�e.

Imaginez-vous une grande salle tapiss�e de fusils et de sabres,
depuis en haut jusqu'en bas; toutes les armes de tous les pays
du monde: carabines, rifles, tromblons, couteaux corses,
couteaux catalans, couteaux-revolvers, couteaux-poignards, krish
[20]malais, fl�ches cara�bes, fl�ches de silex, coups-de-poing,
casse-t�te, massues hottentotes, lazos mexicains, est-ce que je sais!

Par l�-dessus, un grand soleil f�roce qui faisait luire l'acier
des glaives et les crosses des armes � feu, comme pour vous
donner encore plus la chair de poule.... Ce qui rassurait un
[25]peu pourtant, c'�tait le bon air d'ordre et de propret� qui r�gnait
sur toute cette yataganerie. Tout y �tait rang�, soign�, bross�,
�tiquet� comme dans une pharmacie; de loin en loin, un petit
�criteau bonhomme sur lequel on lisait:

_Fl�ches empoisonn�es, n'y touchez pas!_

[30]Ou:

_Armes charg�es, m�fiez-vous!_

Sans ces �criteaux, jamais je n'aurais os� entrer.

Page 3

Au milieu du cabinet, il y avait un gu�ridon. Sur le gu�ridon,
un flacon de rhum, une blague turque, les Voyages du capitaine
Cook, les romans de Cooper, de Gustave Aimard, des r�cits de
chasse � l'ours, chasse au faucon, chasse � l'�l�phant,
[5]Etc.... Enfin, devant le gu�ridon, un homme �tait assis, de
quarante � quarante-cinq ans, petit, gros, trapu, rougeaud, en
bras de chemise, avec des cale�ons de flanelle, une forte barbe
courte et des yeux flamboyants, d'une main il tenait un livre,
de l'autre il brandissait une �norme pipe � couvercle de fer, et,
[10]tout en lisant je ne sais quel formidable r�cit de chasseurs de
chevelures, il faisait, en avan�ant sa l�vre inf�rieure, une moue
terrible, qui donnait � sa brave figure de petit rentier tarasconnais
ce m�me caract�re de f�rocit� bonasse qui r�gnait dans
toute la maison.

[15]Cet homme, c'�tait Tartarin, Tartarin de Tarascon, l'intr�pide,
le grand, l'incomparable Tartarin de Tarascon.




II

_Coup d'oeil g�n�ral
jet� sur la bonne ville de Tarascon;
les chasseurs de casquettes._

Au temps dont je vous parle, Tartarin de Tarascon n'�tait
pas encore le Tartarin qu'il est aujourd'hui, le grand Tartarin
de Tarascon, si populaire dans tout le midi de la France. Pourtant
[20]--m�me � cette �poque--c'�tait d�j� le roi de Tarascon.

Disons d'o� lui venait cette royaut�.

Vous saurez d'abord que l�-bas tout le monde est chasseur,
depuis le plus grand jusqu'au plus petit. La chasse est la passion des
Tarasconnais, et cela depuis les temps mythologiques
[25]o� la Tarasque faisait les cent coups dans les marais de la ville
et o� les Tarasconnais d'alors organisaient des battues contre
elle. Il y a beau jour, comme vous voyez.

Page 4

Donc, tous les dimanches matin, Tarascon prend les armes et
sort de ses murs, le sac au dos, le fusil sur l'�paule, avec un
tremblement de chiens, de furets, de trompes, de cors de chasse.
C'est superbe � voir.... Par malheur, le gibier manque, il
[5]manque absolument.

Si b�tes que soient les b�tes, vous pensez bien qu'� la longue
elles ont fini par se m�fier.

A cinq lieues autour de Tarascon, les terriers sont vides, les
nids abandonn�s. Pas un merle, pas une caille, pas le moindre
[10]lapereau, pas le plus petit cul-blanc.

Elles sont cependant bien tentantes, ces jolies collinettes
tarasconnaises, toutes parfum�es de myrte, de lavande, de romarin;
et ces beaux raisins muscats gonfl�s de sucre, qui s'�chelonnent
an bord du Rh�ne, sont diablement app�tissants aussi....
[15]Oui, mais il y a Tarascon derri�re, et dans le petit monde du
poil et de la plume, Tarascon est tr�s mal not�. Les oiseaux
de passage eux-m�mes l'ont marqu� d'une grande croix sur leurs
feuilles de route, et quand les canards sauvages, descendant vers
la Camargue en longs triangles, aper�oivent de loin les clochers
[20]de la ville, celui qui est en t�te se met � crier bien fort: �Voil�
Tarascon!... voil� Tarascon!� et toute la bande fait un
crochet.

Bref, en fait de gibier, il ne reste plus dans le pays qu'un
vieux coquin de li�vre, �chapp� comme par miracle aux septembrisades
[25]tarasconnaises et qui s'ent�te � vivre l�! A Tarascon,
ce li�vre est tr�s connu. On lui a donn� un nom. Il s'appelle
_le Rapide_. On sait qu'il a son g�te dans la terre de M. Bompard,--ce
qui, par parenth�se, a doubl� et m�me tripl� le prix de
cette terre,--mais on n'a pas encore pu l'atteindre.

[30]A l'heure qu'il est m�me, il n'y a plus que deux ou trois
enrag�s qui s'acharnent apr�s lui.

Les autres en ont fait leur deuil, et _le Rapide_ est pass� depuis
longtemps � l'�tat de superstition locale, bien que le Tarasconnais

Page 5

soit tr�s peu superstitieux de sa nature et qu'il mange les hirondelles
en salmis, quand il en trouve.

--Ah ��! me direz-vous, puisque le gibier est si rare � Tarascon,
qu'est-ce que les chasseurs tarasconnais font donc tous les
[5]dimanches?

Ce qu'ils font?

Eh mon Dieu! ils s'en vont en pleine campagne, � deux ou
trois lieues de la ville. Ils se r�unissent par petits groupes de
cinq ou six, s'allongent tranquillement � l'ombre d'un puits, d'un
[10]vieux mur, d'un olivier, tirent de leurs carniers un bon morceau
de boeuf en daube, des oignons crus, un _saucissot_, quelques
anchois, et commencent un d�jeuner interminable, arros� d'un
de ces jolis vins du Rh�ne qui font rire et qui font chanter.

Apr�s quoi, quand on est bien lest�, on se l�ve, on siffle les
[15]chiens, on arme les fusils, et on se met en chasse. C'est � dire
que chacun de ces messieurs prend sa casquette, la jette en l'air
de toutes ses forces, et la tire au vol avec du 5, du 6, ou du
2,--selon les conventions.

Celui qui met le plus souvent dans sa casquette est proclam�
[20]roi de la chasse, et rentre le soir en triomphateur � Tarascon,
la casquette cribl�e au bout du fusil, au milieu des aboiements
et des fanfares.

Inutile de vous dire qu'il se fait dans la ville un grand commerce
de casquettes de chasse. Il y a m�me des chapeliers qui
[25]vendent des casquettes trou�es et d�chir�es d'avance � l'usage
des maladroits, mais on ne conna�t gu�re que B�zuquet, le
pharmacien, qui leur en ach�te. C'est d�shonorant!

Comme chasseur de casquettes, Tartarin de Tarascon n'avait
pas son pareil. Tous les dimanches matin, il partait avec une
[30]casquette neuve: tous les dimanches soir, il revenait avec une
loque. Dans la petite maison du baobab, les greniers �taient
pleins de ces glorieux troph�es. Aussi, tous les Tarasconnais le
reconnaissent-ils pour leur ma�tre, et comme Tartarin savait �

Page 6

fond le code du chasseur, qu'il avait lu tous les trait�s, tous les
manuels de toutes les chasses possibles, depuis la chasse � la
casquette jusqu'� la chasse au tigre birman, ces messieurs en
avaient fait leur grand justicier cyn�g�tique et le prenaient pour
[5]arbitre dans toutes leurs discussions.

Tous les jours, de trois � quatre, chez I'armurier Costecalde
on voyait un gros homme, grave et la pipe aux dents, assis sur
un fauteuil de cuir vert, au milieu de la boutique pleine de chasseurs
de casquettes, tous debout et se chamaillant. C'�tait Tartarin
[10]de Tarascon qui rendait la justice, Nemrod doubl� de
Salomon.


III


_Nan! Nan! Nan!
Suite du coup d'oeil g�n�ral jet� sur la
bonne ville de Tarascon._

A la passion de la chasse, la forte race tarasconnaise joint une
autre passion: celle des romances. Ce qui se consomme de
romances dans ce petit pays, c'est � n'y pas croire. Toutes les
[15]vieilleries sentimentales qui jaunissent dans les plus vieux cartons,
on les retrouve � Tarascon en pleine jeunesse, en plein
�clat. Elles y sont toutes, toutes. Chaque famille a la sienne,
et dans la ville cela se sait. On sait, par exemple, que celle du
pharmacien B�zuquet, c'est:
[20]      Toi, blanche �toile que j'adore;
Celle de l'armurier Costecalde:
          Veux-tu venir au pays des cabanes?
Celle du receveur de l'enregistrement:
          Si j'�tais-t-invisible, personne n'me verrait.
               (_Chansonnette comique_)

Page 7

Et ainsi de suite pour tout Tarascon. Deux ou trois fois par
semaine, on se r�unit les uns chez les autres et on se _les_ chante.
Ce qu'il y a de singulier, c'est que ce sont toujours les m�mes,
et que, depuis si longtemps qu'ils se les chantent, ces braves
[5]Tarasconnais n'ont jamais envie d'en changer. On se les l�gue
dans les familles, de p�re en fils, et personne n'y touche; c'est
sacr�. Jamais m�me on ne s'en emprunte. Jamais il ne viendrait
� l'id�e des Costecalde de chanter celle des B�zuquet, ni
aux B�zuquet de chanter celle des Costecalde. Et pourtant
[10]vous pensez s'ils doivent les conna�tre depuis quarante ans qu'ils
se les chantent. Mais non! chacun garde la sienne et tout le
monde est content.

Pour les romances comme pour les casquettes, le premier
de la ville �tait encore Tartarin. Sa sup�riorit� sur ses concitoyens
[15]consistait en ceci: Tartarin de Tarascon n'avait pas la
sienne. Il les avait toutes.

Toutes!

Seulement c'�tait le diable pour les lui faire chanter. Revenu
de bonne heure des succ�s de salon, le h�ros tarasconnais aimait
[20]bien mieux se plonger dans ses livres de chasse ou passer sa
soir�e au cercle que de faire le joli coeur devant un piano de
N�mes, entre deux bougies de Tarascon. Ces parades musicales
lui semblaient au-dessous de lui.... Quelquefois cependant,
quand il y avait de la musique � la pharmacie B�zuquet, il entrait
[25]comme par hasard, et apr�s s'�tre bien fait prier, consentait
� dire le grand duo de _Robert le Diable_, avec madame
B�zuquet la m�re.... Qui n'a pas entendu cela n'a jamais
rien entendu.... Pour moi, quand je vivrais cent ans, je verrais
toute ma vie le grand Tartarin s'approchant du piano d'un
[30]pas solennel, s'accoudant, faisant sa moue, et sous le reflet vert
des bocaux de la devanture, essayant de donner � sa bonne
face l'expression satanique et farouche de Robert le Diable.
A peine avait-il pris position, tout de suite le salon fr�missait;

Page 8

on sentait qu'il allait se passer quelque chose de grand....
Alors, apr�s un silence, madame B�zuquet la m�re commen�ait
en s'accompagnant:

          Robert, toi que j'aime
[5]       Et qui re�us ma foi,
          Tu vois mon effroi (_bis_),
          Gr�ce pour toi-m�me
          Et gr�ce pour moi.

A voix basse, elle ajoutait: �A vous, Tartarin,� et Tartarin
[10]de Tarascon, le bras tendu, le poing ferm�, la narine fr�missante
disait par trois fois d'une voix formidable, qui roulait
comme un coup de tonnerre dans les entrailles du piano:
�Non!... non!... non!...� ce qu'en bon M�ridional
il pronon�ait: �Nan!... nan!... nan!...� Sur quoi
[15]madame B�zuquet la m�re reprenait encore une fois:

          Gr�ce pour toi-m�me
          Et gr�ce pour moi.

--�Nan!... nan!... nan!...� hurlait Tartarin de
plus belle, et la chose en restait l�.... Ce n'�tait pas long,
[20]comme vous voyez: mais c'�tait si bien jet�, si bien mim�, si
diabolique, qu'un frisson de terreur courait dans la pharmacie,
et qu'on lui faisait recommencer ses: �Nan!... nan!� quatre
et cinq fois de suite.

L�-dessus Tartarin s'�pongeait le front, souriait aux dames,
[25]clignait de l'oeil aux hommes, et, se retirant sur son triomphe,
s'en allait dire au cercle d'un petit air n�gligent: �Je viens de
chez les B�zuquet chanter le duo de _Robert le Diable!_�

Et le plus fort, c'est qu'il le croyait!...

_Ils!!!_

Page 9

C'est � ces diff�rents talents que Tartarin de Tarascon devait
sa haute situation dans la ville.

Du reste, c'est une chose positive que ce diable d'homme
avait su prendre tout le monde.

[5]A Tarascon, l'arm�e �tait pour Tartarin. Le brave commandant
Bravida, capitaine d'habillement en retraite, disait de lui:
�C'est un lapin!� et vous pensez que le commandant s'y connaissait
en lapins, apr�s en avoir tant habill�.

La magistrature �tait pour Tartarin. Deux ou trois fois, en
[10]plein tribunal, le vieux pr�sident Ladev�ze avait dit, parlant
de lui:

�C'est un caract�re!�

Enfin le peuple �tait pour Tartarin. Sa carrure, sa d�marche,
son air, un air de bon cheval de trompette qui ne craignait pas
[15]le bruit, cette r�putation de h�ros qui lui venait on ne sait d'o�,
quelques distributions de gros sous et de taloches aux petits
d�crotteurs �tal�s devant sa porte, en avaient fait le lord Seymour
de l'endroit, le Roi des halles tarasconnaises. Sur les quais, le dimanche
soir, quand Tartarin revenait de la chasse, la casquette
[20]an bout du canon, bien sangl� dans sa veste de futaine, les
portefaix du Rh�ne s'inclinaient pleins de respect, et se montrant du
coin de l'oeil les biceps gigantesques qui roulaient sur ses bras,
ils se disaient tout has les uns aux autres avec admiration:

�C'est celui-l� qui est fort!... Il a DOUBLES MUSCLES!�

[25]DOUBLES MUSCLES!

Il n'y a qu'� Tarascon qu'on entend de ces choses-l�!

Et pourtant, en d�pit de tout, avec ses nombreux talents, ses
doubles muscles, la faveur populaire et l'estime si pr�cieuse
du brave commandant Bravida, ancien capitaine d'habillement,
[30]Tartarin n'�tait pas heureux; cette vie de petite ville lui pesait,

Page 10

l'�touffait. Le grand homme de Tarascon s'ennuyait � Tarascon.
Le fait est que pour une nature h�ro�que comme la sienne, pour
une �me aventureuse et folle qui ne r�vait que batailles, courses
dans les pampas, grandes chasses, sables du d�sert, ouragans
[5]et typhons, faire tous les dimanches une battue � la casquette
et le reste du temps rendre la justice chez l'armurier Costecalde,
ce n'�tait gu�re.... Pauvre cher grand homme! A la longue,
Il y aurait eu de quoi le faire mourir de consomption.

En vain, pour agrandir ses horizons, pour oublier un peu le
[10]cercle et la place du March�, en vain s'entourait-il de baobabs
et autres v�g�tations africaines; en vain entassait-il armes sur
armes, krish malais sur krish malais; en vain se bourrait-il de
lectures romanesques, cherchant, comme l'immortel don Quichotte,
� s'arracher par la vigueur de son r�ve aux griffes de
[15]l'impitoyable r�alit�.... H�las! tout ce qu'il faisait pour
apaiser sa soif d'aventures ne servait qu'� l'augmenter. La vue
de toutes ses armes l'entretenait dans un �tat perp�tuel de
col�re et d'excitation. Ses rifles, ses fl�ches, ses lazos lui criaient:

�Bataille! bataille!� Dans les branches de son baobab, le vent
[20]des grands voyages soufflait et lui donnait de mauvais conseils.
Pour l'achever, Gustave Aimard et Fenimore Cooper....

Oh! par les lourdes apr�s-midi d'�t� quand il �tait seul � lire
an milieu de ses glaives, que de fois Tartarin s'est lev� en
rugissant; que de fois il a jet� son livre et s'est pr�cipit� sur le mur
[25]pour d�crocher une panoplie!

Le pauvre homme oubliait qu'il �tait chez lui � Tarascon, avec
un foulard de t�te et des cale�ons, il mettait ses lectures en
actions, et, s'exaltant au son de sa propre voix, criait en brandissant
une hache ou un tomahawk:

[30]�Qu'ils y viennent maintenant!�

_Ils?_ Qui, _Ils?_

Tartarin ne le savait pas bien lui-m�me.... _Ils!_ c'�tait
tout ce qui attaque, tout ce qui combat, tout ce qui mord, tout

Page 11

ce qui griffe, tout ce qui scalpe, tout ce qui hurle, tout ce qui
rugit.... _Ils!_ c'�tait I'Indien Sioux dansant autour du poteau
de guerre o� le malheureux blanc est attach�.

C'�tait l'ours gris des montagnes Rocheuses qui se dandine,
[5]et qui se l�che avec une langue pleine de sang. C'�tait encore
le Touareg du d�sert, le pirate malais, le bandit des Abruzzes....
_Ils_ enfin, c'�tait _ils!_ ... c'est-�-dire la guerre, les voyages,
l'aventure, la gloire.

Mais, h�las! I'intr�pide Tarasconnais avait beau _les_ appeler,
[10]_les_ d�fier ... _ils_ ne venaient jamais.... P�ca�r�! qu'est-ce
qu'_ils_ seraient venus faire � Tarascon?

Tartarin cependant _les_ attendait toujours;--surtout le soir
en allant au cercle.


V


_Quand Tartarin allait au cercle._


Le chevalier du Temple se disposant � faire une sortie contre
[15]l'infid�le qui l'assi�ge, le _tigre_ chinois s'�quipant pour la
bataille,
le guerrier comanche entrant sur le sentier de la guerre, tout
cela n'est rien aupr�s de Tartarin de Tarascon s'armant de pied
en cap pour aller au cercle, � neuf heures du soir, une heure
apr�s les clairons de la retraite.

[20]Branle-has de combat! comme disent les matelots.

A la main gauche, Tartarin prenait un coup-de-poing � pointes
de fer, � la main droite une canne � �p�e; dans la poche gauche,
un casse-t�te; dans la poche droite, un revolver. Sur la poitrine,
entre drap et flanelle, un krish malais. Par exemple, jamais de
[25]fl�che empoisonn�e; ce sont des armes trop d�loyales!...

Avant de partir, dans le silence et l'ombre de son cabinet, il
s'exer�ait un moment, se fendait, tirait au mur, faisait jouer ses
muscles; puis, il prenait son passe-partout, et traversait le jardin,
gravement, sans se presser.--A l'anglaise, messieurs, � l'anglaise!
[30]c'est le vrai courage.--Au bout du jardin, il ouvrait la

Page 12

lourde porte de fer. Il l'ouvrait brusquement, violemment, de
fa�on � ce qu'elle all�t battre en dehors contre la muraille....
S'_ils_ avaient �t� derri�re, vous pensez quelle marmelade!...
Malheureusement, _ils_ n'�taient pas derri�re.

[5]La porte ouverte, Tartarin sortait, jetait vite un coup d'oeil de
droite et de gauche, fermait la porte � double tour et vivement.
Puis en route.

Sur le chemin d'Avignon, pas un chat. Portes closes, fen�tres �teintes.
Tout �tait noir. De loin en loin un r�verb�re,
[10]clignotant dans le brouillard du Rh�ne....

Superbe et calme, Tartarin de Tarascon s'en allait ainsi dans
la nuit, faisant sonner ses talons en mesure, et du bout ferr� de
sa canne arrachant des �tincelles aux pav�s.... Boulevards,
grandes rues ou ruelles, il avait soin de tenir toujours le milieu
[15]de la chauss�e, excellente mesure de pr�caution qui vous permet
de voir venir le danger, et surtout d'�viter ce qui, le soir, dans
les rues de Tarascon, tombe quelquefois des fen�tres. A lui voir
tant de prudence, n'allez pas croire au moins que Tartarin e�t
peur.... Non! seulement il se gardait.

[20]La meilleure preuve que Tartarin n'avait pas peur, c'est qu'au
lieu d'aller au cercle par le cours, il y allait par la ville,
c'est-�-dire, par le plus long, par le plus noir, par un tas de vilaines
petites rues au bout desquelles on voit le Rh�ne luire sinistrement.
Le pauvre homme esp�rait toujours qu'au d�tour d'un de ces
[25]coupe-gorge _ils_ allaient s'�lancer de I'ombre et lui tomber sur le
dos. _Ils_ auraient �t� bien re�us, je vous en r�ponds.... Mais,
h�las! par une d�rision du destin, jamais, au grand jamais,
Tartarin de Tarascon n'eut la chance de faire une mauvaise
rencontre. Pas m�me un chien, pas m�me un ivrogne. Rien!

[30]Parfois cependant une fausse alerte. Un bruit de pas, des voix
�touff�es.... �Attention!� se disait Tartarin, et il restait plant�
sur place, scrutant I'ombre, prenant le vent, appuyant son oreille
contre terre � la mode indienne.... Les pas approchaient.

Page 13

Les voix devenaient distinctes.... Plus de doutes! _Ils_ arrivaient....
_Ils_ �taient l�.  D�j� Tartarin, l'oeil en feu, la poitrine
haletante, se ramassait sur lui-m�me comme un jaguar, et
se pr�parait � bondir en poussant son cri de guerre ... quand
[5]tout � coup, du sein de l'ombre, il entendait de bonnes voix
tarasconnaises l'appeler bien tranquillement:

�T�! v�! ... c'est Tartarin.... Et adieu, Tartarin!�

Mal�diction! c'�tait le pharmacien B�zuquet avec sa famille
qui venait de chanter _la sienne_ chez les Costecalde.--�Bonsoir!
[10]bonsoir!� grommelait Tartarin, furieux de sa m�prise, et,
farouche, la canne haute, il s'enfon�ait dans la nuit.

Arriv� dans la rue du cercle, l'intr�pide Tarasconnais attendait
encore un moment en se promenant de long en large devant
la porte avant d'entrer.... A la fin, las de _les_ attendre et certain
[15]qu'_ils_ ne se montreraient pas, il jetait un dernier regard de
d�fi dans l'ombre, et murmurait avec col�re:
�Rien!... rien!... jamais rien!�

L�-dessus le brave homme entrait faire son b�sigue avec le
commandant.


VI


_Les deux Tartarins_.


[20]Avec cette rage d'aventures, ce besoin d'�motions fortes, cette
folie de voyages, de courses, de diable au vert, comment diantre
se trouvait-il que Tartarin de Tarascon n'e�t jamais quitt�
Tarascon?

Car c'est un fait. Jusqu'� l'�ge de quarante-cinq ans, l'intr�pide
[25]Tarasconnais n'avait pas une fois couch� hors de sa ville.
Il n'avait pas m�me fait ce fameux voyage � Marseille, que tout
bon Proven�al se paie � sa majorit�. C'est au plus s'il connaissait
Beaucaire, et cependant Beaucaire n'est pas bien loin de
Tarascon, puisqu'il n'y a que le pont � traverser Malheureusement
[30]ce diable de pont a �t� si souvent emport� par les coups

Page 14

de vent, il est si long, si fr�le, et le Rh�ne a tant de largeur �
cet endroit que, ma foi! vous comprenez.... Tartarin de
Tarascon pr�f�rait la terre ferme.

C'est qu'il faut bien vous l'avouer, il y avait dans notre h�ros
[5]deux natures tr�s distinctes. �Je sens deux hommes en moi�,
a dit je ne sais quel P�re de l'�glise. Il l'e�t dit vrai de Tartarin
qui portait en lui l'�me de don Quichotte, les m�mes �lans
chevaleresques, le m�me id�al h�ro�que, la m�me folie du romanesque
et du grandiose; mais malheureusement n'avait pas le
[10]corps du c�l�bre hidalgo, ce corps osseux et maigre, ce pr�texte
de corps, sur lequel la vie mat�rielle manquait de prise, capable
de passer vingt nuits sans d�boucler sa cuirasse et quarante-huit
heures avec une poign�e de riz.... Le corps de Tartarin, au
contraire, �tait un brave homme de corps, tr�s gras, tr�s lourd,
[15]tr�s sensuel, tr�s douillet, tr�s geignard, plein d'app�tits bourgeois
et d'exigences domestiques, le corps ventru et court sur
pattes de l'immortel Sancho Pan�a.

Don Quichotte et Sancho Pan�a dans le m�me homme! vous
comprenez quel mauvais m�nage ils y devaient faire! quels combats!
[20]quels d�chirements!... O le beau dialogue � �crire
pour Lucien ou pour Saint-�vremond, un dialogue entre les
deux Tartarins, le Tartarin-Quichotte et le Tartarin-Sancho!
Tartarin-Quichotte s'exaltant aux r�cits de Gustave Aimard et
criant: �Je pars!�

[25]Tartarin-Sancho ne pensant qu'aux rhumatismes et disant:
�Je reste.�

TARTARIN-QUICHOTTE, tr�s exalt�:
Couvre-toi de gloire, Tartarin.

TARTARIN-SANCHO, tr�s calme:
[30]Tartarin, couvre-toi de flanelle.

TARTARIN-QUICHOTTE, de plus en plus exalt�:
O les bons rifles � deux coups! � les dagues, les lazos, les
mocassins!

Page 15

TARTARIN-SANCHO, de plus en plus calme:
O les bons gilets tricot�s! les bonnes genouill�res bien
chaudes! � les braves casquettes � oreillettes!

TARTARIN-QUICHOTTE, hors de lui:
[5]Une hache! qu'on me donne une hache!

TARTARIN-SANCHO, sonnant la bonne:
Jeannette, mon chocolat.

L�-dessus Jeannette appara�t avec un excellent chocolat, chaud,
moir�, parfum�, et de succulentes grillades � l'anis, qui font rire
[10]Tartarin-Sancho en �touffant les cris de Tartarin-Quichotte.

Et voil� comme il se trouvait que Tartarin de Tarascon
n'e�t jamais quitt� Tarascon.


VII


_Les Europ�ens � Shang-Ha�.
Le Haut Commerce. Les Tartares.
Tartarin de Tarascon serait-il un imposteur?
Le mirage._


Une fois cependant Tartarin avait failli partir, partir pour
un grand voyage.

[15]Les trois fr�res Garcio-Camus, des Tarasconnais �tablis �
Shang-Ha�, lui avaient offert la direction d'un de leurs comptoirs
l�-bas. �a, par exemple, c'�tait bien la vie qu'il lui fallait. Des
affaires consid�rables, tout un monde de commis � gouverner,
des relations avec la Russie, la Perse, la Turquie d'Asie, enfin
[20]le Haut Commerce.

Dans la bouche de Tartarin, ce mot de Haut Commerce vous
apparaissait d'une hauteur!...

La maison de Garcio-Camus avait en outre cet avantage
qu'on y recevait quelquefois la visite des Tartares. Alors vite
[25]on fermait les portes. Tous les commis prenaient les armes, on

Page 16

hissait le drapeau consulaire, et pan! pan! par les fen�tres sur
les Tartares.

Avec quel enthousiasme Tartarin-Quichotte sauta sur cette
proposition, je n'ai pas besoin de vous le dire; par malheur
[5]Tartarin Sancho n'entendait pas de cette oreille l�, et, comme il
�tait le plus fort, l'affaire ne put pas s'arranger. Dans la ville
on en parla beaucoup. Partira-t-il? ne partira-t-il pas? Parions
que si, parions que non. Ce fut un �v�nement.... En fin de
compte, Tartarin ne partit pas, mais toutefois cette histoire lui
[10]fit beaucoup d'honneur. Avoir failli aller � Shang-Hai ou y �tre
all�, pour Tarascon, c'�tait tout comme. A force de parler du
voyage de Tartarin, on finit par croire qu'il en revenait, et le
soir, au cercle, tous ces messieurs lui demandaient des renseignements
sur la vie � Shang-Ha�, sur les moeurs, le climat, l'opium,
[15]le Haut Commerce.

Tartarin, tr�s bien renseign�, donnait de bonne gr�ce les
d�tails qu'on voulait, et, � la longue, le brave homme n'�tait pas
bien s�r lui m�me de n'�tre pas all� � Shang-Ha�, si bien qu'en
racontant pour la centi�me fois la descente des Tartares, il en
[20]arrivait � dire tr�s naturellement �Alors, je fais armer mes
commis, je hisse le pavillon consulaire, et pan! pan! par les
fen�tres, sur les tartares.� En entendant cela, tout le cercle
fr�missait....

--Mais alors, votre Tartarin n'�tait qu'un affreux menteur.

[25]--Non! mille fois non! Tartarin n'�tait pas un menteur....

--Pourtant, il devait bien savoir qu'il n'�tait pas all� �
Shang-Ha�!

--Eh! sans doute, il le savait. Seulement....

Seulement, �coutez bien ceci. Il est temps de s'entendre une
[30]fois pour toutes sur cette r�putation de menteurs que les gens
du Nord ont faite aux M�ridionaux. Il n'y a pas de menteurs
dans le Midi, pas plus � Marseille qu'� N�mes, qu'� Toulouse
qu'� Tarascon. L'homme du Midi ne ment pas, il se trompe.

Page 17

Il ne dit pas toujours la v�rit�, mais il croit la dire.... Son
mensonge � lui, ce n'est pas du mensonge, c'est une esp�ce de
mirage....
Oui, du mirage!... Et pour bien me comprendre, allez-vous-en
[5]dans le Midi, et vous verrez. Vous verrez ce diable de pays o�
le soleil transfigure tout, et fait tout plus grand que nature. Vous
verrez ces petites collines de Provence pas plus hautes que la
butte Montmartre et qui vous para�tront gigantesques, vous
verrez la Maison carr�e de N�mes,--un petit bijou d'�tag�re,
[10]--qui vous semblera aussi grande que Notre-Dame. Vous verrez.
Ah! le seul menteur du Midi, s'il y en a un, c'est le
Soleil.... Tout ce qu'il touche, il l'exag�re!... Qu'est-ce que
c'�tait que Sparte aux temps de sa splendeur? Une bourgade.
Qu'est ce que c'�tait qu'Ath�nes? Tout au plus une
[15]sous-pr�fecture ... et pourtant dans l'histoire elles nous apparaissent
comme des villes �normes. Voil� ce que le soleil en
a fait....

Vous �tonnerez-vous apr�s cela que le m�me soleil, tombant
sur Tarascon, ait pu faire d'un ancien capitaine d'habillement
[20]comme Bravida, le brave commandant Bravida, d'un navet un
baobab, et d'un homme qui avait failli aller � Shang-Hai un
homme qui y �tait all�?


VIII


_La m�nagerie Mitaine.
Un lion de l'Atlas � Tarascon.
Terrible et solennelle entrevue_.


Et maintenant que nous avons montr� Tartarin de Tarascon
comme il �tait en son priv�, avant que la gloire l'e�t bais� au
[25]front et coiff� du laurier s�culaire, maintenant que nous avons
racont� cette vie h�ro�que dans un milieu modeste, ses joies, ses
douleurs, ses r�ves, ses esp�rances, h�tons-nous d'arriver aux

Page 18

grandes pages de son histoire et au singulier �v�nement qui
devait donner l'essor � cette incomparable destin�e.

C'�tait un soir, chez l'armurier Costecalde. Tartarin de
Tarascon �tait en train de d�montrer � quelques amateurs le
[5]maniement du fusil � aiguille, alors dans toute sa nouveaut�....
Soudain la porte s'ouvre, et un chasseur de casquettes se pr�cipite
effar� dans la boutique, en criant: �Un lion!... un
lion!...� Stupeur g�n�rale, effroi, tumulte, bousculade. Tartarin
croise la ba�onnette, Costecalde court fermer la porte. On
[10]entoure le chasseur, on l'interroge, on le presse, et voici ce
qu'on apprend: la m�nagerie Mitaine, revenant de la foire de
Beaucaire, avait consenti � faire une halte de quelques jours �
Tarascon et venait de s'installer sur la place du ch�teau avec un
tas de boas, de phoques, de crocodiles et un magnifique lion
[15]de l'Atlas.

Un lion de l'Atlas � Tarascon! Jamais, de m�moire d'homme,
pareille chose ne s'�tait vue. Aussi comme nos braves chasseurs
de casquettes se regardaient fi�rement! quel rayonnement sur
leurs m�les visages, et, dans tous les coins de la boutique Costecalde,
[20]quelles bonnes poign�es de mains silencieusement �chang�es!
L'�motion �tait si grande, si impr�vue, que personne ne
trouvait un mot � dire....

Pas m�me Tartarin. P�le et fr�missant, le fusil � aiguille
encore entre les mains, il songeait debout devant le comptoir....

[25]Un lion de l'Atlas, l�, tout pr�s, � deux pas! Un lion! c'est-�-dire
la b�te h�ro�que et f�roce par excellence, le roi des fauves,
le gibier de ses r�ves, quelque chose comme le premier sujet de
cette troupe id�ale qui lui jouait de si beaux drames dans son
imagination....

[30]Un lion, mille dieux!...

Et de l'Atlas encore!!! C'�tait plus que le grand Tartarin
n'en pouvait supporter....

Tout � coup un paquet de sang lui monta au visage.

Page 19

Ses yeux flamb�rent. D'un geste convulsif il jeta le fusil �
aiguille sur son �paule, et, se tournant vers le brave commandant
Bravida, ancien capitaine d'habillement, il lui dit d'une voix
de tonnerre: �Allons voir �a, commandant.�

[5]--�H�! b� ... h�! b� ... Et mon fusil!... mon fusil
� aiguille que vous emportez!...� hasarda timidement le
prudent Costecalde; mais Tartarin avait tourn� la rue, et derri�re
lui tous les chasseurs de casquettes embo�tant fi�rement
le pas.

[10]Quand ils arriv�rent � la m�nagerie, il y avait d�j� beaucoup
de monde. Tarascon, race h�ro�que, mais trop longtemps priv�e
de spectacles � sensations, s'�tait ru� sur la baraque Mitaine
et l'avait prise d'assaut. Aussi la grosse madame Mitaine �tait
bien contente.... En costume kabyle, les bras nus jusqu'au
[15]coude, des bracelets de fer aux chevilles, une cravache dans une
main, dans l'autre un poulet vivant, quoique plum�, l'illustre
dame faisait les honneurs de la baraque aux Tarasconnais, et
comme elle avait _doubles muscles_, elle aussi, son succ�s �tait
presque aussi grand que celui de ses pensionnaires.

[20]L'entr�e de Tartarin, le fusil sur l'�paule, jeta un froid.

Tous ces braves Tarasconnais, qui se promenaient bien tranquillement
devant les cages, sans armes, sans m�fiance, sans
m�me aucune id�e de danger, eurent un mouvement de terreur assez
naturel en voyant leur grand Tartarin entrer dans la baraque avec son
[25]formidable engin de guerre. Il y avait donc
quelque chose � craindre, puisque lui, ce h�ros.... En un clin
d'oeil, tout le devant des cages se trouva d�garni. Les enfants
criaient de peur, les dames regardaient la porte. Le pharmacien
B�zuquet s'esquiva, en disant qu'il allait chercher son fusil....

[30]Peu � peu cependant, l'attitude de Tartarin rassura les courages.
Calme, la t�te haute, l'intr�pide Tarasconnais fit lentement
le tour de la baraque, passa sans s'arr�ter devant la baignoire du
phoque, regarda d'un oeil d�daigneux la longue caisse pleine de

Page 20

son o� le boa dig�rait son poulet cru, et vint enfin se planter
devant la cage du lion....

Terrible et solennelle entrevue! le lion de Tarascon et le lion
de l'Atlas en face l'un de l'autre.... D'un c�t�, Tartarin,
[5]debout, le jarret tendu, les deux bras appuy�s sur son rifle; de
l'autre, le lion, un lion gigantesque, vautr� dans la paille, l'oeil
clignotant, l'air abruti, avec son �norme mufle � perruque jaune
pos� sur les pattes de devant.... Tous deux calmes et se
regardant.

[10]Chose singuli�re! soit que le fusil � aiguille lui e�t donn� de
l'humeur, soit qu'il e�t flair� un ennemi de sa race, le lion, qui
jusque-l� avait regard� les Tarasconnais d'un air de souverain
m�pris en leur b�illant au nez � tous, le lion eut tout � coup un
mouvement de col�re. D'abord il renifla, gronda sourdement,
[15]�carta ses griffes, �tira ses pattes; puis il se leva, dressa la t�te,
secoua sa crini�re, ouvrit une gueule immense et poussa vers
Tartarin un formidable rugissement.

Un cri de terreur lui r�pondit. Tarascon, affol�, se pr�cipita
vers les portes. Tous, femmes, enfants, portefaix, chasseurs de
[20]casquettes, le brave commandant Bravida lui-m�me.... Seul,
Tartarin de Tarascon ne bougea pas.... Il �tait l�, ferme et
r�solu, devant la cage, des �clairs dans les yeux et cette terrible
moue que toute la ville connaissait.... Au bout d'un moment,
quand les chasseurs de casquettes, un peu rassur�s par son attitude
[25]et la solidit� des barreaux, se rapproch�rent de leur chef,
ils entendirent qu'il murmurait, en regardant le lion: ��a, oui,
c'est une chasse.�

Ce jour-l�, Tartarin de Tarascon n'en dit pas davantage....


IX


_Singuliers effets du mirage_.


Page 21

Ce jour-l�, Tartarin de Tarascon n'en dit pas davantage; mais
le malheureux en avait d�j� trop dit....

Le lendemain, il n'�tait bruit dans la ville que du prochain
d�part de Tartarin pour l'Alg�rie et la chasse aux lions. Vous
[5]�tes tous t�moins, chers lecteurs, que le brave homme n'avait
pas souffl� mot de cela; mais vous savez, le mirage....

Bref, tout Tarascon ne parlait que de ce d�part.

Sur le cours, au cercle, chez Costecalde, les gens s'abordaient
d'un air effar�:

[10]�Et autrement, vous savez la nouvelle, au moins?

--Et autrement, quoi donc?... le d�part de Tartarin, au
moins?�

Car � Tarascon toutes les phrases commencent par _et autrement_,
qu'on prononce _autremain_, et finissent par _au moins_, qu'on
[15]prononce _an mouain_. Or, ce jour-l�, plus que tous les autres,
les _au mouain_ et les _autremain_ sonnaient � faire trembler les
vitres.

L'homme le plus surpris de la ville, en apprenant qu'il allait
partir pour l'Afrique, ce fut Tartarin. Mais voyez ce que c'est
[20]que la vanit�! Au lieu de r�pondre simplement qu'il ne partait
pas du tout, qu'il n'avait jamais eu l'intention de partir, le pauvre
Tartarin--la premi�re fois qu'on lui parla de ce voyage--fit
d'un petit air �vasif: �H�!... h�!... peut-�tre ... je ne
dis pas.� La seconde fois, un peu plus familiaris� avec cette
[25]id�e, il r�pondit: �C'est probable.� La troisi�me fois: �C'est
certain!�

Enfin, le soir, au cercle et chez les Costecalde, entra�n� par
le punch aux oeufs, les bravos, les lumi�res; gris� par le succ�s

Page 22

que l'annonce de son d�part avait eu dans la ville, le malheureux
d�clara formellement qu'il �tait las de chasser la casquette et
qu'il allait, avant peu, se mettre � la poursuite des grands lions
de l'Atlas.

[5]Un hourra formidable accueillit cette d�claration. L�-dessus,
nouveau punch aux oeufs, poign�es de mains, accolades et s�r�nade
aux flambeaux jusqu'� minuit devant la petite maison du
baobab.

C'est Tartarin-Sancho qui n'�tait pas content! Cette id�e de
[10]voyage en Afrique et de chasse au lion lui donnait le frisson par
avance, et, en rentrant au logis, pendant que la s�r�nade d'honneur
sonnait sous leurs fen�tres, il fit � Tartarin-Quichotte une
sc�ne effroyable, l'appelant toqu�, visionnaire, imprudent, triple
fou, lui d�taillant par le menu toutes les catastrophes qui l'attendaient
[15]dans cette exp�dition, naufrages, rhumatismes, fi�vres
chaudes, dysenteries, peste noire, �l�phantiasis, et le reste....

En vain Tartarin-Quichotte jurait-il de ne pas faire d'imprudences,
qu'il se couvrirait bien, qu'il emporterait tout ce qu'il
faudrait, Tartarin-Sancho ne voulait rien entendre. Le pauvre
[20]homme se voyait d�j� d�chiquet� par les lions, englouti dans les
sables du d�sert comme feu Cambyse, et l'autre Tartarin ne
parvint � l'apaiser un peu qu'en lui expliquant que ce n'�tait
pas pour tout de suite, que rien ne pressait et qu'en fin de
compte ils n'�taient pas encore partis.

[25]Il est bien clair, en effet, que l'on ne s'embarque pas pour
une exp�dition semblable sans prendre quelques pr�cautions
Il faut savoir o� l'on va, que diable! et ne pas partir comme
un oiseau....

Avant toutes choses, le Tarasconnais voulut lire les r�cits des
[30]grands touristes africains, les relations de Mungo-Park, de Caill�,
du docteur Livingstone, d'Henri Duveyrier.

L�, il vit que ces intr�pides voyageurs, avant de chausser leurs
sandales pour les excursions lointaines, s'�taient pr�par�s de

Page 23

longue main � supporter la faim, la soif, les marches forc�es,
les privations de toutes sortes. Tartarin voulut faire comme eux,
et, � partir de ce jour-l�, ne se nourrit plus que d'_eau bouillie_.
--Ce qu'on appelle _eau bouillie_, � Tarascon, c'est quelques tranches
[5]de pain noy�es dans de l'eau chaude, avec une gousse d'ail, un
peu de thym, un brin de laurier.--Le r�gime �tait s�v�re, et
vous pensez si le pauvre Sancho fit la grimace....

A l'entra�nement par l'eau bouillie Tartarin de Tarascon joignit
d'autres sages pratiques. Ainsi, pour prendre l'habitude des
[10]longues marches, il s'astreignit � faire chaque matin son tour de
ville sept ou huit fois de suite, tant�t au pas acc�l�r�, tant�t au
pas gymnastique, les coudes au corps et deux petits cailloux blancs
dans la bouche, selon la mode antique.

Puis, pour se faire aux fra�cheurs nocturnes, aux brouillards,
[15]� la ros�e, il descendait tous les soirs dans son jardin et restait
l� jusqu'� des dix et onze heures, seul avec son fusil, � l'aff�t
derri�re le baobab....

Enfin, tant que la m�nagerie Mitaine resta � Tarascon,
les chasseurs de casquettes attard�s chez Costecalde purent
[20]voir dans l'ombre, en passant sur la place du Ch�teau, un
homme myst�rieux se promenant de long en large derri�re la
baraque.

C'�tait Tartarin de Tarascon, qui s'habituait � entendre sans
fr�mir les rugissements du lion dans la nuit sombre.


X


_Avant le d�part_.


[25]Pendant que Tartarin s'entra�nait ainsi par toute sorte de
moyens h�ro�ques, tout Tarascon avait les yeux sur lui; on ne
s'occupait plus d'autre chose. La chasse � la casquette ne battait
plus que d'une aile, les romances ch�maient. Dans la pharmacie
B�zuquet le piano languissait sous une housse verte, et

Page 24

les mouches cantharides s�chaient dessus, le ventre en l'air....
L'exp�dition de Tartarin avait arr�t� tout.

Il fallait voir le succ�s du Tarasconnais dans les salons. On
se l'arrachait, on se le disputait, on se l'empruntait, on se le
[5]volait. Il n'y avait pas de plus grand honneur pour les dames
que d'aller � la m�nagerie Mitaine au bras de Tartarin, et de se
faire expliquer devant la cage du lion comment on s'y prenait
pour chasser ces grandes b�tes, o� il fallait viser, � combien de
pas, si les accidents �taient nombreux, etc., etc.

[10]Tartarin donnait toutes les explications qu'on voulait. Il avait
lu Jules G�rard et connaissait la chasse au lion sur le bout du
doigt, comme s'il l'avait faite. Aussi parlait-il de ces choses avec
une grande �loquence.

Mais o� il �tait le plus beau, c'�tait le soir � d�ner chez le
[15]pr�sident Ladev�ze ou le brave commandant Bravida, ancien
capitaine d'habillement, quand on apportait le caf� et que, toutes
les chaises se rapprochant, on le faisait parler de ses chasses
futures....

Alors, le coude sur la nappe, le nez dans son moka, le h�ros
[20]racontait d'une voix �mue tous les dangers qui l'attendaient
l�-has. Il disait les longs aff�ts sans lune, les marais pestilentiels,
les rivi�res empoisonn�es par la feuille du laurier-ros�, les
neiges, les soleils ardents, les scorpions, les pluies de sauterelles;
il disait aussi les moeurs des grands lions de l'Atlas, leur fa�on
[25]de combattre, leur vigueur ph�nom�nale et leur f�rocit� au
temps du rut....

Puis, s'exaltant � son propre r�cit, il se levait de table, bondissait
au milieu de la salle � manger, imitant le cri du lion, le
[30]bruit d'une carabine, pan! pan! le sifflement d'une balle explosible,
pfft! pfft! gesticulait, rugissait, renversait les chaises....

Autour de la table, tout le monde �tait p�le. Les hommes se
regardaient en hochant la t�te, les dames fermaient les yeux avec
de petits cris d'effroi, les vieillards brandissaient leurs longues

Page 26

cannes belliqueusement, et, dans la chambre � c�t�, les petits
gar�onnets qu'on couche de bonne heure, �veill�s en sursaut
par les rugissements et les coups de feu, avaient grand'peur et
demandaient de la lumi�re.

[5]En attendant, Tartarin ne partait pas.


XI


_Des coups d'�p�e, Messieurs, des coups d'�p�e....
Mais pas de coups d'�pingle!_


Avait-il bien r�ellement l'intention de partir?... Question
d�licate, et � laquelle l'historien de Tartarin serait fort embarrass�
de r�pondre.

Toujours est-il que la m�nagerie Mitaine avait quitt� Tarascon
[10]depuis plus de trois mois, et le tueur de lions ne bougeait pas....
Apr�s tout, peut-�tre le candide h�ros, aveugl� par un nouveau
mirage, se figurait-il de bonne foi qu'il �tait all� en Alg�rie.
Peut-�tre qu'� force de raconter ses futures chasses, il s'imaginait
les avoir faites, aussi sinc�rement qu'il s'imaginait avoir
[15]hiss� le drapeau consulaire et tir� sur les Tartares, pan! pan! �
Shang-Hai.

Malheureusement, si cette fois encore Tartarin de Tarascon
fut victime du mirage, les Tarasconnais ne le furent pas. Lorsqu'au
bout de trois mois d'attente, on s'aper�ut que le chasseur
[20]n'avait pas encore fait une malle, on commen�a � murmurer.

�Ce sera comme pour Shang-Hai!� disait Costecalde en souriant.
Et le mot de l'armurier fit fureur dans la ville; car personne
ne croyait plus en Tartarin.

Les na�fs, les poltrons, des gens comme B�zuquet, qu'une
[25]puce aurait mis en fuite et qui ne pouvaient pas tirer un coup
de fusil sans fermer les yeux, ceux-l� surtout �taient impitoyables.
Au cercle, sur l'esplanade, ils abordaient le pauvre Tartarin avec
de petits airs goguenards.

Page 27

�Et _autremain_, pour quand ce voyage?� Dans la boutique
Costecalde, son opinion ne faisait plus foi. Les chasseurs de
casquettes reniaient leur chef!

Puis les �pigrammes s'en m�l�rent. Le pr�sident Ladev�ze,
[5]qui faisait volontiers en ses heures de loisir deux doigts de cour
� la muse proven�ale, composa dans la langue du cru une chanson
qui eut beaucoup de succ�s. Il �tait question d'un certain
grand chasseur appel� ma�tre Gervais, dont le fusil redoutable
devait exterminer jusqu'au dernier tous les lions d'Afrique. Par
[10]malheur ce diable de fusil �tait de complexion singuli�re: _on le
chargeait toujours, il ne partait jamais_.

Il ne partait jamais! vous comprenez l'allusion....

En un tour de main, cette chanson devint populaire; et quand
Tartarin passait, les portefaix du quai, les petits d�crotteurs de
[15]devant sa porte chantaient en choeur:

_Lou f�sio� de mestre Gerva�
Toujou lou cargon, toujou lou cargon,
Lou f�sio� de mestre Gerva�
Toujou lou cargon, part jama�_.

[20]Seulement cela se chantait de loin, � cause des doubles muscles.
O fragilit� des engouements de Tarascon!...
Le grand homme, lui, feignait de ne rien voir, de ne rien entendre;
mais au fond cette petite guerre sourde et venimeuse
l'affligeait beaucoup; il sentait Tarascon lui glisser dans la main,
[25]la faveur populaire aller � d'autres, et cela le faisait horriblement
souffrir.

Ah! la grande gamelle de la popularit�, il fait bon s'asseoir
devant, mais quel �chaudement quand elle se renverse!...

En d�pit de sa souffrance, Tartarin souriait et menait paisiblement
[30]sa m�me vie, comme si de rien n'�tait.

Quelquefois cependant ce masque de joyeuse insouciance,
qu'il s'�tait par fiert� coll� sur le visage, se d�tachait subitement.
Alors, au lieu du rire, on voyait l'indignation et la douleur....

Page 28

C'est ainsi qu'un matin que les petits d�crotteurs chantaient
sous ses fen�tres: _Lou f�sio� de mestre Gerva�_, les voix de ces
mis�rables arriv�rent jusqu'� la chambre du pauvre grand homme
en train de se raser devant sa glace. (Tartarin portait toute sa
[5]barbe, mais, comme elle venait trop forte, il �tait oblig� de la
surveiller.)

Tout � coup la fen�tre s'ouvrit violemment et Tartarin apparut
en chemise, en serre-t�te, barbouill� de bon savon blanc,
brandissant son rasoir et sa savonnette, et criant d'une voix
[10]formidable:

�Des coups d'�p�e, messieurs, des coups d'�p�e!... Mais
pas de coups d'�pingle!�

Belles paroles dignes de l'histoire, qui n'avaient que le tort de
s'adresser � ces petits _fouchtras_, hauts comme leurs bo�tes �
[15]cirage, et gentilhommes tout � fait incapables de tenir une �p�e!


XII


_De ce qui fut dit dans la petite maison du baobab_.

Au milieu de la d�fection g�n�rale, l'arm�e seule tenait bon
pour Tartarin.

Le brave commandant Bravida, ancien capitaine d'habillement,
continuait � lui marquer la m�me estime: �C'est un lapin!�
[20]s'ent�tait-il � dire, et cette affirmation valait bien, j'imagine,
Celle du pharmacien B�zuquet.... Pas une fois le brave commandant
n'avait fait allusion au voyage en Afrique; pourtant, quand
la clameur publique devint trop forte, il se d�cida � parler.

Un soir, le malheureux Tartarin �tait seul dans son cabinet,
[25]pensant � des choses tristes, quand il vit entrer le commandant,
grave, gant� de noir, boutonn� jusqu'aux oreilles.

�Tartarin,� fit l'ancien capitaine avec autorit�, �Tartarin, il
faut partir!� Et il restait debout dans l'encadrement de la porte,
--rigide et grand comme le devoir.

Page 29

Tout ce qu'il y avait dans ce �Tartarin, il faut partir!� Tartarin
de Tarascon le comprit.

Tr�s p�le, il se leva, regarda autour de lui d'un oeil attendri ce
joli cabinet, bien clos, plein de chaleur et de lumi�re douce, ce
[5]large fauteuil si commode, ses livres, son tapis, les grands stores
blancs de ses fen�tres, derri�re lesquels tremblaient les branches
gr�les du petit jardin, puis, s'avan�ant vers le brave commandant,
il lui prit la main, la serra avec �nergie, et d'une voix o� roulaient
des larmes, sto�que cependant, il lui dit �Je partirai, Bravida!�

[10]Et il partit comme il l'avait dit. Seulement pas encore tout
de suite ... il lui fallut le temps de s'outiller.

D'abord il commanda chez Bompard deux grandes malles doubl�es
de cuivre, avec une longue plaque portant cette inscription:

TARTARIN DE TARASCON
CAISSE D'ARMES.

Le doublage et la gravure prirent beaucoup de temps. Il
[15]commanda aussi chez Tastavin un magnifique album de voyage
pour �crire son journal, ses impressions, car enfin on a beau
chasser le lion, on pense tout de m�me en route.

Puis il fit venir de Marseille toute une cargaison de conserves
alimentaires, du pemmican en tablettes pour faire du bouillon,
[20]une tente-abri d'un nouveau mod�le, se montant et se d�montant
� la minute, des bottes de marin, deux parapluies, un waterproof,
des lunettes bleues pour pr�venir les ophtalmies. Enfin
le pharmacien B�zuquet lui confectionna une petite pharmacie
portative bourr�e de sparadrap, d'arnica, de camphre, de vinaigre
[25]des quatre-voleurs.

Pauvre Tartarin! ce qu'il en faisait, ce n'�tait pas pour lui;
mais il esp�rait, � force de pr�cautions et d'attentions d�licates,
apaiser la fureur de Tartarin-Sancho, qui, depuis que le d�part
�tait d�cid�, ne d�col�rait ni de jour ni de nuit.


XIII


_Le d�part_.


Page 30

Enfin il arriva, le jour solennel, le grand jour.

D�s l'aube, tout Tarascon �tait sur pied, encombrant le chemin
d'Avignon et les abords de la petite maison du baobab.

Du monde aux fen�tres, sur les toits, sur les arbres; des
[5]mariniers du Rh�ne, des portefaix, des d�crotteurs, des bourgeois,
des ourdisseuses, des taffetassi�res, le cercle, enfin toute
la ville; puis aussi des gens de Beaucaire qui avaient pass� le
pont, des mara�chers de la banlieue, des charrettes � grandes
b�ches, des vignerons hiss�s sur de belles mules attif�es de
[10]rubans, de flots, de grelots, de noeuds, de sonnettes, et m�me,
de loin en loin, quelques jolies filles d'Arles venues en croupe
de leur galant, le ruban d'azur autour de la t�te, sur de petits
chevaux de Camargue gris de fer.

Toute cette foule se pressait, se bousculait devant la porte
[15]de Tartarin, ce bon M. Tartarin, qui s'en allait tuer des lions
chez les _Teurs_.

Pour Tarascon, l'Alg�rie, l'Afrique, la Gr�ce, la Perse, la
Turquie, la M�sopotamie, tout cela forme un grand pays tr�s
vague, presque mythologique, et cela s'appelle les _Teurs_ (les
[20]Turcs).

Au milieu de cette cohue, les chasseurs de casquettes allaient
et venaient, fiers du triomphe de leur chef, et tra�ant sur leur
passage comme des sillons glorieux.

Devant la maison du baobab, deux grandes brouettes. De
[25]temps en temps, la porte s'ouvrait, laissant voir quelques personnes
qui se promenaient gravement dans le petit jardin. Des
hommes apportaient des malles, des caisses, des sacs de nuit,
qu'ils empilaient sur les brouettes.

A chaque nouveau colis, la foule fr�missait. On se nommait
[30]les objets � haute voix. ��a, c'est la tente-abri.... �a, ce

Page 30

sont les conserves ... la pharmacie ... les caisses d'armes....�
Et les chasseurs de casquettes donnaient des explications.

Tout � coup, vers dix heures, il se fit un grand mouvement
dans la foule. La porte du jardin tourna sur ses gonds
[5]violemment.

�C'est lui! ... c'est lui!� criait-on.

C'�tait lui....

Quand il parut sur le seuil, deux cris de stupeur partirent de
la foule:
[10]�C'est un _Teur!_...

--Il a des lunettes!�

Tartarin de Tarascon, en effet, avait cru de son devoir, allant
en Alg�rie, de prendre le costume alg�rien. Large pantalon
bouffant en toile blanche, petite veste collante � boutons de
[15]m�tal, deux pieds de ceinture rouge autour de l'estomac, le cou
nu, le front ras�, sur sa t�te une gigantesque _ch�chia_ (bonnet
rouge) et un flot bleu d'une longueur!... Avec cela, deux
lourds fusils, un sur chaque �paule, un grand couteau de chasse
� la ceinture, sur le ventre une cartouchi�re, sur la hanche un
[20]revolver se balan�ant dans sa poche de cuir. C'est tout....

Ah! pardon, j'oubliais les lunettes, une �norme paire de lunettes
bleues qui venaient l� bien � propos pour corriger ce qu'il
y avait d'un pen trop farouche dans la tournure de notre h�ros!

�Vive Tartarin! ... vive Tartarin!� hurla le peuple. Le
[25]grand homme sourit, mais ne salua pas, � cause de ses fusils
qui le g�naient. Du reste, il savait maintenant � quoi s'en tenir
sur la faveur populaire; peut-�tre m�me qu'au fond de son �me
il maudissait ses terribles compatriotes, qui l'obligeaient � partir,
� quitter son joli petit chez lui aux murs blancs, aux persiennes
[30]vertes.... Mais cela ne se voyait pas.

Calme et fier, quoiqu'un peu p�le, il s'avan�a sur la chauss�e,
regarda ses brouettes, et, voyant que tout �tait bien, prit gaillardement
le chemin de la gare, sans m�me se retourner une

Page 31

fois vers la maison du baobab. Derri�re lui marchaient le brave
commandant Bravida, ancien capitaine d'habillement, le pr�sident
Ladev�ze, puis l'armurier Costecalde et tous les chasseurs de
casquettes, puis les brouettes, puis le peuple.

[5]Devant l'embarcad�re, le chef de gare l'attendait,--un vieil
Africain de 1830, qui lui serra la main plusieurs fois avec chaleur.

L'express Paris-Marseille n'�tait pas encore arriv�. Tartarin
et son �tat-major entr�rent dans les salles d'attente. Pour �viter
l'encombrement, derri�re eux le chef de gare fit fermer les grilles.

[10]Pendant un quart d'heure, Tartarin se promena de long en
large dans les salles, au milieu des chasseurs de casquettes. Il
leur parlait de son voyage, de sa chasse, promettant d'envoyer
des peaux. On s'inscrivait sur son carnet pour une peau comme
pour une contredanse.

[15]Tranquille et doux comme Socrate au moment de boire la
cigu�, l'intr�pide Tarasconnais avait un mot pour chacun, un
sourire pour tout le monde. Il parlait simplement, d'un air
affable; on aurait dit qu'avant de partir, il voulait laisser derri�re
lui comme une tra�n�e de charme, de regrets, de bons souvenirs.
[20]D'entendre leur chef parler ainsi, tous les chasseurs de casquettes
avaient des larmes, quelques-uns m�me des remords, comme le
pr�sident Ladev�ze et le pharmacien B�zuquet.

Des hommes d'�quipe pleuraient dans des coins. Dehors, le
peuple regardait � travers les grilles, et criait: �Vive Tartarin!�

[25]Enfin la cloche sonna. Un roulement sourd, un sifflet d�chirant
�branla, les vo�tes.... En voiture! en voiture!

�Adieu, Tartarin!... adieu, Tartarin!...

--Adieu, tous!...� murmura le grand homme, et sur les
joues du brave commandant Bravida il embrassa son cher
[30]Tarascon.

Puis il s'�lan�a sur la voie, et monta dans un wagon plein de
Parisiennes, qui pens�rent mourir de peur en voyant arriver cet
homme �trange avec tant de carabines et de revolvers.


XIV


_Le port de Marseille. Embarque! Embarque!_


Page 32

Le 1er d�cembre 186..., � l'heure de midi, par un soleil d'hiver
proven�al, un temps clair, luisant, splendide, les Marseillais
effar�s virent d�boucher sur la Canebi�re un _Teur_, oh mais, un
_Teur!..._ Jamais ils n'en avaient vu un comme celui-l�; et
[5]pourtant, Dieu sait s'il en manque � Marseille, des _Teurs!_

Le _Teur_ en question,--ai-je besoin de vous le dire?--c'�tait
Tartarin, le grand Tartarin de Tarascon, qui s'en allait le long
des quais, suivi de ses caisses d'armes, de sa pharmacie, de ses
conserves, rejoindre l'embarcad�re de la compagnie Touache, et
[10]le paquebot le _Zouave_, qui devait l'emporter l�-bas.

L'oreille encore pleine des applaudissements tarasconnais,
gris� par la lumi�re du ciel, l'odeur de la mer, Tartarin rayonnant
marchait, ses fusils sur l'�paule, la t�te haute, regardant de
tous ses yeux ce merveilleux port de Marseille qu'il voyait pour
[15]la premi�re fois, et qui l'�blouissait.... Le pauvre homme
croyait r�ver. Il lui semblait qu'il s'appelait Sinbad le Marin, et
qu'il errait dans une de ces villes fantastiques comme il y en a
dans les _Mille et une nuits._

C'�tait � perte de vue un fouillis de m�ts, de vergues, se
[20]croisant dans tous les sens. Pavillons de tous les pays, russes,
grecs, su�dois, tunisiens, am�ricains.... Les navires au ras du
quai, les beaupr�s arrivant sur la berge comme des rang�es de
ba�onnettes. Au-dessous les na�ades, les d�esses, les saintes
vierges et autres sculptures de bois peint qui donnent le nom au
[25]vaisseau; tout cela mang� par l'eau de mer, d�vor�, ruisselant,
moisi.... De temps en temps, entre les navires, un morceau
de mer, comme une grande moire tach�e d'huile.... Dans
l'enchev�trement des vergues, des nu�es de mouettes faisant de
jolies taches sur le ciel bleu, des mousses qui s'appelaient dans
[30]toutes les langues.

Page 33

Sur le quai, au milieu des ruisseaux qui venaient des savonneries,
verts, �pais, noir�tres, charg�s d'huile et de soude, tout
un peuple de douaniers, de commissionnaires, de portefaix avec
leurs _bogheys_ attel�s de petits chevaux corses.

[5]Des magasins de confections bizarres, des baraques enfum�es
o� les matelots faisaient leur cuisine, des marchands de pipes,
des marchands de singes, de perroquets, de cordes, de toiles �
voiles, des bric-�-brac fantastiques o� s'�talaient p�le-m�le de
vieilles coulevrines, de grosses lanternes dor�es, de vieux palans,
[10]de vieilles ancres �dent�es, vieux cordages, vieilles poulies, vieux
portevoix, lunettes marines du temps de Jean Bart et de Duguay-Trouin. Des
vendeuses de moules et de clovisses accroupies et
piaillant � c�t� de leurs coquillages. Des matelots passant avec
des pots de goudron, des marmites fumantes, de grands paniers
[15]pleins de poulpes qu'ils allaient laver dans l'eau blanch�tre des
fontaines.

Partout, un encombrement prodigieux de marchandises de
toute esp�ce: soieries, minerais, trains de bois, saumons de
plomb, draps, sucres, caroubes, colzas, r�glisses, cannes � sucre.
[20]L'Orient et l'Occident p�le-m�le. De grands tas de fromages de
Hollande que les G�noises teignaient en rouge avec leurs mains.

L�-has, le quai au bl�; les portefaix d�chargeant leurs sacs
sur la berge du haut de grands �chafaudages. Le bl�, torrent
d'or, qui roulait au milieu d'une fum�e blonde. Des hommes en
[25]fez rouge, le criblant � mesure dans de grands tamis de peau
d'�ne, et le chargeant sur des charrettes qui s'�loignaient suivies
d'un r�giment de femmes et d'enfants avec des balayettes
et des paniers � glanes.... Plus loin, le bassin de car�nage,
les grands vaisseaux couch�s sur le flanc et qu'on flambait avec
[30]des broussailles pour les d�barrasser des herbes de la mer, les
vergues trempant dans l'eau, l'odeur de la r�sine, le bruit assourdissant
des charpentiers doublant la coque des navires avec
de grandes plaques de cuivre.

Page 34

Parfois, entre les m�ts, une �claircie. Alors Tartarin voyait
l'entr�e du port, le grand va-et-vient des navires, une fr�gate
anglaise partant pour Malte, pimpante et bien lav�e, avec des
officiers en gants jaunes, ou bien un grand brick marseillais
[5]d�marrant au milieu des cris, des jurons, et � l'arri�re un gros
capitaine en redingote et chapeau de soie, commandant la manoeuvre
en proven�al. Des navires qui s'en allaient en courant,
toutes voiles dehors. D'autres l�-has, bien loin, qui arrivaient
lentement, dans le soleil, comme en l'air.

[10]Et puis tout le temps un tapage effroyable, roulement de
charrettes, ce �oh! hisse!� des matelots, jurons, chants, sifflets de
bateaux � vapeur, les tambours et les clairons du fort Saint-Jean,
du fort Saint-Nicolas, les cloches de la Major, des Accoules,
de Saint-Victor; par l�-dessus le mistral qui prenait tous ces
[15]bruits, toutes ces clameurs, les roulait, les secouait, les confondait
avec sa propre voix et en faisait une musique folle, sauvage,
h�ro�que comme la grande fanfare du voyage, fanfare qui donnait
envie de partir, d'aller loin, d'avoir des ailes.

C'est au son de cette belle fanfare que l'intr�pide Tartarin de
[20]Tarascon s'embarqua pour le pays des lions!...





DEUXI�ME �PISODE



CHEZ LES TEURS


I


_La travers�e. Les cinq positions de la ch�chia.
Le soir du troisi�me jour.
Mis�ricorde._


Page 35

Je voudrais, mes chers lecteurs, �tre peintre et grand peintre
pour mettre sous vos yeux, en t�te de ce second �pisode, les
diff�rentes positions que prit la _ch�chia_ de Tartarin de Tarascon,
dans ces trois jours de travers�e qu'elle fit � bord du _Zouave_,
[5]entre la France et l'Alg�rie.

Je vous la montrerais d'abord au d�part sur le pont, h�ro�que
et superbe comme elle �tait, aur�olant cette belle t�te tarasconnaise.
Je vous la montrerais ensuite � la sortie du port,
quand le _Zouave_ commence � caracoler sur les lames: je vous
[10]la montrerais fr�missante, �tonn�e, et comme sentant d�j� les
premi�res atteintes de son mal.

Puis, dans le golfe du Lion, � mesure qu'on avance au large
et que la mer devient plus dure, je vous la ferais voir aux prises
avec la temp�te, se dressant effar�e sur le cr�ne du h�ros, et son
[15]grand flot de laine bleue qui se h�risse dans la brume de mer
et la bourrasque.... Quatri�me position. Six heures du soir,
en vue des c�tes corses. L'infortun�e _ch�chia_ se penche par-dessus
le bastingage et lamentablement regarde et sonde la mer....
Enfin, cinqui�me et derni�re position, au fond d'une �troite cabine,
[20]dans un petit lit qui a l'air d'un tiroir de commode, quelque chose
d'informe et de d�sol� roule en geignant sur l'oreiller. C'est la

Page 36

_ch�chia_, l'h�ro�que _ch�chia_ du d�part, r�duite maintenant au vulgaire
�tat de casque � m�che et s'enfon�ant jusqu'aux oreilles
d'une t�te de malade bl�me et convulsionn�e....

Ah! si les Tarasconnais avaient pu voir leur grand Tartarin
[5]couch� dans son tiroir de commode sous le jour blafard et triste
qui tombait des hublots, parmi cette odeur fade de cuisine et
de bois mouill�, l'�coeurante odeur du paquebot; s'ils l'avaient
entendu r�ler � chaque battement de l'h�lice, demander du th�
toutes les cinq minutes et jurer contre le gar�on avec une petite
[10]voix d'enfant, comme ils s'en seraient voulu de l'avoir oblig� �
Partir.... Ma parole d'historien! le pauvre _Teur_ faisait piti�.
Surpris tout � coup par le mal, l'infortun� n'avait pas eu le
courage de desserrer sa ceinture alg�rienne, ni de se d�fubler
de son arsenal. Le couteau de chasse � gros manche lui cassait
[15]la poitrine, le cuir de son revolver lui meurtrissait les jambes.
Pour l'achever, les bougonnements de Tartarin-Sancho, qui ne
cessait de geindre et de pester:

�Imb�cile, va!... Je te l'avais bien dit!... Ah! tu as
voulu aller en Afrique ... Eh bien, t�! la voil� l'Afrique!...
[20]Comment la trouves-tu?�

Ce qu'il y avait de plus cruel, c'est que du fond de sa cabine
et de ses g�missements, le malheureux entendait les passagers
du grand salon rire, manger, chanter, jouer aux cartes. La
soci�t� �tait aussi joyeuse que nombreuse � bord du _Zouave_.
[25]Des officiers qui rejoignaient leurs corps, des dames de l'_Alcazar_
de Marseille, des cabotins, un riche musulman qui revenait
de la Mecque, un prince mont�n�grin tr�s farceur qui faisait
des imitations de Ravel et de Gil P�r�s.... Pas un de ces
gens-l� n'avait le mal de mer, et leur temps se passait � boire
[30]du Champagne avec le capitaine du _Zouave_, un bon gros vivant
de Marseillais, qui avait m�nage � Alger et � Marseille, et
r�pondait au joyeux nom de Barbassou.

Page 37

Tartarin de Tarascon en voulait � tous ces mis�rables. Leur
gaiet� redoublait son mal....

Enfin, dans l'apr�s-midi du troisi�me jour, il se fit � bord du
navire un mouvement extraordinaire qui tira notre h�ros de sa
[5]longue torpeur. La cloche de l'avant sonnait. On entendait les
grosses bottes des matelots courir sur le pont.

�Machine en avant!... machine en arri�re!� criait la voix
enrou�e du capitaine Barbassou.

Puis �Machine, stop!� Un grand arr�t, une secousse, et
[10]plus rien.... Rien que le paquebot se balan�ant silencieusement
de droite � gauche, comme un ballon dans l'air....

Cet �trange silence �pouvanta le Tarasconnais.

�Mis�ricorde! nous sombrons!� cria-t-il d'une voix terrible,
et, retrouvant ses forces par magie, il bondit de sa couchette,
[15]et se pr�cipita sur le pont avec son arsenal.


II


_Aux armes! Aux armes!_


On ne sombrait pas, on arrivait.

Le _Zouave_ venait d'entrer dans la rade, une belle rade aux
eaux noires et profondes, mais silencieuse, morne, presque
d�serte. En face, sur une colline, Alger la blanche avec ses
[20]petites maisons d'un blanc mat qui descendent vers la mer,
serr�es les unes contre les autres. Un �talage de blanchisseuse
sur le coteau de Meudon. Par l�-dessus un grand ciel de satin
bleu, oh! mais si bleu!...

L'illustre Tartarin, un peu remis de sa frayeur, regardait le
[25]paysage, en �coutant avec respect le prince mont�n�grin, qui,
debout � ses c�tes, lui nommait les diff�rents quartiers de la ville,
la Casbah, la ville haute, la rue Bab-Azoun. Tr�s bien �lev�, ce
prince mont�n�grin, de plus connaissant � fond l'Alg�rie et
parlant l'arabe couramment. Aussi Tartarin se proposait-il de

Page 38

cultiver sa connaissance.... Tout � coup, le long du bastingage
contre lequel ils �taient appuy�s, le Tarasconnais aper�oit
une rang�e de grosses mains noires qui se cramponnaient par
dehors. Presque aussit�t une t�te de n�gre toute cr�pue appara�t
[5]devant lui, et, avant qu'il ait eu le temps d'ouvrir la bouche,
le pont se trouve envahi de tous c�t�s par une centaine de forbans,
noirs, jaunes, � moiti� nus, hideux, terribles.

Ces forbans-l�, Tartarin les connaissait.... C'�taient eux,
c'est-�-dire ILS, ces fameux ILS qu'il avait si souvent cherch�s la
[10]nuit dans les rues de Tarascon. Enfin ILS se d�cidaient donc
� venir!

... D'abord la surprise le cloua sur place. Mais quand il
vit les forbans se pr�cipiter sur les bagages, arracher la b�che
qui les recouvrait, commencer enfin le pillage du navire, alors
[15]le h�ros se r�veilla, et d�gainant son couteau de chasse: �Aux
armes! aux armes!� cria-t-il aux voyageurs, et le premier de
tous, il fondit sur les pirates.

�_Qu�s aco?_ qu'est-ce qu'il y a? qu'est-ce que vous avez?�
fit le capitaine Barbassou, qui sortait de l'entrepont.
[20]�Ah! vous voil�, capitaine!... vite, vite, armez vos hommes.

--H�! pourquoi faire, _boun Diou?_

--Mais vous ne voyez donc pas...?

--Quoi donc?...

--L� ... devant vous ... les pirates....�

[25]Le capitaine Barbassou le regardait tout ahuri. A ce moment,
un grand diable de n�gre passait devant eux, en courant, avec
la pharmacie du h�ros sur son dos:

�Mis�rable!... attends-moi!...� hurla le Tarasconnais;
et il s'�lan�a, la dague en avant.
[30]Barbassou le rattrapa au vol, et, le retenant par sa ceinture:

�Mais restez donc tranquille, tron de ler!... Ce ne sont
pas des pirates.... Il y a longtemps qu'il n'y en a plus de
Pirates.... Ce sont des portefaix.

Page 39

--Des portefaix!...

--H�! oui, des portefaix, qui viennent chercher les bagages
pour les porter � terre.... Rengainez donc votre coutelas,
donnez-moi votre billet, et marchez derri�re ce n�gre, un brave
[5]gar�on, qui va vous conduire � terre, et m�me jusqu'� l'h�tel si
vous le d�sirez!...�

Un peu confus, Tartarin donna son billet, et, se mettant �
la suite du n�gre, descendit par le tire-vieille dans une grosse
barque qui dansait le long du navire. Tous ses bagages y
[10]�taient d�j�, ses malles, caisses d'armes, conserves alimentaires;
comme ils tenaient toute la barque, on n'eut pas besoin d'attendre
d'autres voyageurs. Le n�gre grimpa sur les malles et
s'y accroupit comme un singe, les genoux dans ses mains. Un
autre n�gre prit les rames.... Tous deux regardaient Tartarin
[15]en riant et montrant leurs dents blanches.

Debout � l'arri�re, avec cette terrible moue qui faisait la terreur
de ses compatriotes, le grand Tarasconnais tourmentait fi�vreusement
le manche de son coutelas; car, malgr� ce qu'avait
pu lui dire Barbassou, il n'�tait qu'� moiti� rassur� sur les intentions
[20]de ces portefaix � peau d'�b�ne, qui ressemblaient si peu
aux braves portefaix de Tarascon....

Cinq minutes apr�s, la barque arrivait � terre, et Tartarin
posait le pied sur ce petit quai barbaresque, o� trois cents ans
auparavant, un gal�rien espagnol nomm� Michel Cervantes pr�parait
[25]--sous le b�ton de la chiourme alg�rienne--un sublime
roman qui devait s'appeler _Don Quichotte_!


III


_Invocation � Cervantes. D�barquement.
O� sont les Teurs? Pas de Teurs.
D�sillusion._


Page 40

O Michel Cervantes Saavedra, si ce qu'on dit est vrai, qu'aux
lieux o� les grands hommes ont habit� quelque chose d'eux-m�mes
erre et flotte dans l'air jusqu'� la fin des �ges, ce qui
restait de toi sur la plage barbaresque dut tressaillir de joie en
[5]voyant d�barquer Tartarin de Tarascon, ce type merveilleux
du Fran�ais du Midi en qui s'�taient incarn�s les deux h�ros de
ton livre, Don Quichotte et Sancho Pan�a....

L'air �tait chaud ce jour-l�. Sur le quai ruisselant de soleil,
cinq ou six douaniers, des Alg�riens attendant des nouvelles de
[10]France, quelques Maures accroupis qui fumaient leurs longues
pipes, des matelots maltais ramenant de grands filets o� des
milliers de sardines luisaient entre les mailles comme de petites
pi�ces d'argent.

Mais � peine Tartarin eut-il mis pied � terre, le quai s'anima,
[15]changea d'aspect. Une bande de sauvages, encore plus hideux
que les forbans du bateau, se dressa d'entre les cailloux de la
berge et se rua sur le d�barquant. Grands Arabes tout nus sous
des couvertures de laine, petits Maures en guenilles, N�gres,
Tunisiens, Mahonnais, M'zabites, gar�ons d'h�tel en tablier
[20]blanc, tous criant, hurlant, s'accrochant � ses habits, se disputant
ses bagages, l'un emportant ses conserves, l'autre sa pharmacie,
et, dans un charabia fantastique, lui jetant � la t�te des
noms d'h�tel invraisemblables....

�tourdi de tout ce tumulte, le pauvre Tartarin allait, venait,
[25]pestait, jurait, se d�menait, courait apr�s ses bagages, et, ne
sachant comment se faire comprendre de ces barbares, les
haranguait en fran�ais, en proven�al, et m�me en latin, du
latin de Pourceaugnac, _rosa, la rose, bonus, bona, bonum_, tout

Page 41

ce qu'il savait.... Peine perdue. On ne l'�coutait pas....
Heureusement qu'un petit homme, v�tu d'une tunique � collet
jaune, et arm� d'une longue canne de compagnon, intervint
comme un dieu d'Hom�re dans la m�l�e, et dispersa toute cette
[5]racaille � coups de b�ton. C'�tait un sergent de ville alg�rien.
Tr�s poliment, il engagea Tartarin � descendre � l'h�tel de
l'Europe, et le confia � des gar�ons de l'endroit qui l'emmen�rent,
lui et ses bagages, en plusieurs brouettes.

Aux premiers pas qu'il fit dans Alger, Tartarin de Tarascon
[10]ouvrit de grands yeux. D'avance il s'�tait figur� une
ville orientale, f�erique, mythologique, quelque chose tenant le
milieu entre Constantinople et Zanzibar.... Il tombait en
plein Tarascon.... Des caf�s, des restaurants, de larges
rues, des maisons � quatre �tages, une petite place macadamis�e
[15]o� des musiciens de la ligne jouaient des polkas d'Offenbach,
des messieurs sur des chaises buvant de la bi�re avec
des �chaud�s, des dames, quelques lorettes, et puis des militaires,
encore des militaires, toujours des militaires ... et pas
un _Teur!..._ Il n'y avait que lui.... Aussi, pour traverser
[20]la place, se trouva-t-il un peu g�n�. Tout le monde le regardait.
Les musiciens de la ligne s'arr�t�rent, et la polka d'Offenbach
resta un pied en l'air.

Les deux fusils sur l'�paule, le revolver sur la hanche, farouche
et majestueux comme Robinson Cruso�, Tartarin passa
[25]gravement au milieu de tous les groupes; mais en arrivant �
l'h�tel ses forces l'abandonn�rent. Le d�part de Tarascon, le
port de Marseille, la travers�e, le prince mont�n�grin, les pirates,
tout se brouillait et roulait dans sa t�te.... Il fallut le monter
� sa chambre, le d�sarmer, le d�shabiller.... D�j� m�me on
[30]parlait d'envoyer chercher un m�decin; mais, � peine sur l'oreiller,
le h�ros se mit � ronfler si haut et de si bon coeur, que l'h�telier
jugea les secours de la science inutiles, et tout le monde se retira
discr�tement.


IV


_Le premier aff�t._


Page 42

Trois heures sonnaient � l'horloge du Gouvernement, quand
Tartarin se r�veilla. Il avait dormi toute la soir�e, toute la nuit,
toute la matin�e, et m�me un bon morceau de l'apr�s-midi; il
faut dire aussi que depuis trois jours la _ch�chia_ en avait vu de
[5]rudes!...

La premi�re pens�e du h�ros, en ouvrant les yeux, fut celle-ci:
�Je suis dans le pays du lion!� pourquoi ne pas le dire? �
cette id�e que les lions �taient l� tout pr�s, � deux pas, et
presque sous la main, et qu'il allait falloir en d�coudre, brr! ... un
[10]froid mortel le saisit, et il se fourra intr�pidement sous
sa couverture.

Mais, au bout d'un moment, la gaiet� du dehors, le ciel si
bleu, le grand soleil qui ruisselait dans la chambre, un bon petit
d�jeuner qu'il se fit servir au lit, sa fen�tre grande ouverte sur
[15]la mer, le tout arros� d'un excellent flacon de vin de Crescia,
lui rendit bien vite son ancien h�ro�sme. �Au lion! au lion!�
cria-t-il en rejetant sa couverture, et il s'habilla prestement.

Voici quel �tait son plan: sortir de la ville sans rien dire �
personne, se jeter en plein d�sert, attendre la nuit, s'embusquer,
[20]et, au premier lion qui passerait, pan! pan!... Puis revenir
le lendemain d�jeuner � l'h�tel de l'Europe, recevoir les f�licitations
des Alg�riens et fr�ter une charrette pour aller chercher
l'animal.

Il s'arma donc � la h�te, roula sur son dos la tente-abri dont
[25]le gros manche montait d'un bon pied au-dessus de sa t�te, et
raide comme un pieu, descendit dans la rue. L�, ne voulant
demander sa route � personne de peur de donner l'�veil sur
ses projets, il tourna carr�ment � droite, enfila jusqu'an bout
les arcades Bab-Azoun, o� du fond de leurs noires boutiques
[30]des nu�es de juifs alg�riens le regardaient passer, embusqu�s

Page 43

dans un coin comme des araign�es; traversa la place du Th��tre,
prit le faubourg et enfin la grande route poudreuse de Mustapha.

Il y avait sur cette route un encombrement fantastique. Omnibus,
fiacres, corricolos, des fourgons du train, de grandes charrettes
[5]de foin tra�n�es par des boeufs, des escadrons de chasseurs
d'Afrique, des troupeaux de petits �nes microscopiques, des
n�gresses qui vendaient des galettes, des voitures d'Alsaciens
�migrants, des spahis en manteaux rouges, tout cela d�filant
dans un tourbillon de poussi�re, au milieu des cris, des chants,
[10]des trompettes, entre deux haies de m�chantes baraques o�
l'on voyait de grandes Mahonnaises se peignant devant leurs
portes, des cabarets pleins de soldats, des boutiques de bouchers,
D'�quarrisseurs....

�Qu'est-ce qu'ils me chantent donc avec leur Orient?� pensait
[15]le grand Tartarin; �il n'y a pas m�me tant de _Teurs_ qu'�
Marseille.�

Tout � coup, il vit passer pr�s de lui, allongeant ses grandes
jambes et rengorg� comme un dindon, un superbe chameau.
Cela lui fit battre le coeur.

[20]Des chameaux d�j�! Les lions ne devaient pas �tre loin; et,
en effet, au bout de cinq minutes, il vit arriver vers lui, le fusil
sur l'�paule, toute une troupe de chasseurs de lions.

�Les l�ches!� se dit notre h�ros en passant � c�t� d'eux,
�les l�ches! Aller au lion par bandes, et avec des chiens!...�
[25]Car il ne se serait jamais imagin� qu'en Alg�rie on p�t chasser
autre chose que des lions. Pourtant ces chasseurs avaient de
si bonnes figures de commer�ants retir�s, et puis cette fa�on
de chasser le lion avec des chiens et des carnassi�res �tait si
patriarcale, que le Tarasconnais, un peu intrigu�, crut devoir
[30]aborder un de ces messieurs.

�Et autrement, camarade, bonne chasse?

--Pas mauvaise,� r�pondit l'autre en regardant d'un oeil
effar� l'armement consid�rable du guerrier de Tarascon.

Page 44

�Vous avez tu�?

--Mais oui ... pas mal ... voyez plut�t.� Et le chasseur alg�rien
montrait sa carnassi�re, toute gonfl�e de lapins et de b�casses.

�Comment �a! votre carnassi�re?... vous les mettez dans
[5]votre carnassi�re?

--O� voulez-vous donc que je les mette?

--Mais alors, c'est ... c'est des tout petits....

--Des petits et puis des gros,� fit le chasseur. Et comme
il �tait press� de rentrer chez lui, il rejoignit ses camarades �
[10]grandes enjamb�es.

L'intr�pide Tartarin en resta plant� de stupeur au milieu de
la route.... Puis, apr�s un moment de r�flexion: �Bah!�
se dit-il, �ce sont des blagueurs.... Ils n'ont rien tu� du
Tout....� et il continua son chemin.

[15]D�j� les maisons se faisaient plus rares, les passants aussi.
La nuit tombait, les objets devenaient confus... Tartarin de
Tarascon marcha encore une demi-heure. A la fin il s'arr�ta....
C'�tait tout � fait la nuit. Nuit sans lune, cribl�e d'�toiles.
Personne sur la route.... Malgr� tout, le h�ros pensa que
[20]les lions n'�taient pas des diligences et ne devaient pas volontiers
suivre le grand chemin. Il se jeta � travers champs....
A chaque pas des foss�s, des ronces, des broussailles. N'importe!
il marchait toujours.... Puis tout � coup, halte! �Il
y a du lion dans l'air par ici,� se dit notre homme, et il renifla
[25]fortement de droite et de gauche.


V


_Pan! Pan!_


C'�tait un grand d�sert sauvage, tout h�riss� de plantes
bizarres, de ces plantes d'Orient qui ont l'air de b�tes m�chantes.
Sous le jour discret des �toiles, leur ombre agrandie s'�tirait par
terre en tous sens. A droite, la masse confuse et lourde d'une

Page 45

montagne, l'Atlas peut-�tre!... A gauche, la mer invisible,
qui roulait sourdement.... Un vrai g�te � tenter les fauves....

Un fusil devant lui, un autre dans les mains, Tartarin de
Tarascon mit un genou en terre et attendit.... Il attendit une
[5]heure, deux heures.... Rien!... Alors il se souvint que, dans
ses livres, les grands tueurs de lions n'allaient jamais � la chasse
sans emmener un petit chevreau qu'ils attachaient � quelques
pas devant eux et qu'ils faisaient crier en lui tirant la patte
avec une ficelle. N'ayant pas de chevreau, le Tarasconnais eut
[10]l'id�e d'essayer des imitations, et se mit � b�ler d'une voix
chevrotante: �M�! M�!...�

D'abord tr�s doucement, parce qu'au fond de l'�me il avait
tout de m�me un peu peur que le lion l'entend�t ... puis, voyant
que rien ne venait, il b�la plus fort: �M�!... M�!...�
[15]Rien encore!... Impatient�, il reprit de plus belle et plusieurs
fois de suite: �M�!... M�!... M�!...� avec tant de
puissance que ce chevreau finissait par avoir l'air d'un boeuf....

Tout � coup, � quelques pas devant lui, quelque chose de
noir et de gigantesque s'abattit. Il se tut.... Cela se baissait, flairait
[20]la terre, bondissait, se roulait, partait au galop, puis revenait
et s'arr�tait net ... c'�tait le lion, � n'en pas douter!...
Maintenant on voyait tr�s bien ses quatre pattes courtes, sa
formidable encolure, et deux yeux, deux grands yeux qui luisaient dans
l'ombre.... En joue! feu! pan! pan!... C'�tait
[25]fait. Puis tout de suite un bondissement en arri�re, et le coutelas
de chasse au poing.

Au coup de feu du Tarasconnais, un hurlement terrible
r�pondit.

�Il en a!� cria le bon Tartarin, et, ramass� sur ses fortes
[30]jambes, il se pr�parait � recevoir la b�te; mais elle en avait plus
que son compte et s'enfuit au triple galop en hurlant.... Lui
pourtant ne bougea pas. Il attendait la femelle ... toujours
comme dans ses livres!

Page 46

Par malheur la femelle ne vint pas. Au bout de deux ou
trois heures d'attente, le Tarasconnais se lassa. La terre �tait
humide, la nuit devenait fra�che, la bise de mer piquait.

�Si je faisais un somme en attendant le jour?� se dit-il, et,
[5]pour �viter les rhumatismes, il eut recours � la tente-abri....
Mais voil� le diable! cette tente-abri �tait d'un syst�me si ing�nieux,
si ing�nieux, qu'il ne put jamais venir � bout de l'ouvrir.

Il eut beau s'escrimer et suer pendant une heure, la damn�e
tente ne s'ouvrit pas.... Il y a des parapluies qui, par des
[10]pluies torrentielles, s'amusent � vous jouer de ces tours-l�....
De guerre lasse, le Tarasconnais jeta l'ustensile par terre, et se
coucha dessus, en jurant comme un vrai Proven�al qu'il �tait.

�_Ta, ta, ra, ta, Tarata!_....

--_Qu�s aco?..._� fit Tartarin, s'�veillant en sursaut.
[15]C'�taient les clairons des chasseurs d'Afrique qui sonnaient
la diane, dans les casernes de Mustapha.... Le tueur de
lions, stup�fait, se frotta les yeux.... Lui qui se croyait en
plein d�sert!... Savez-vous o� il �tait...? Dans un carr�
d'artichauts, entre un plant de choux-fleurs et un plant de
[20]betteraves.

Son Sahara avait des l�gumes.... Tout pr�s de lui, sur la
jolie c�te verte de Mustapha sup�rieur, des villas alg�riennes,
toutes blanches, luisaient dans la ros�e du jour levant: on se
serait cru aux environs de Marseille, au milieu des _bastides_ et
[25]des _bastidons_.

La physionomie bourgeoise et potag�re de ce paysage endormi
�tonna beaucoup le pauvre homme, et le mit de fort m�chante
humeur.

�Ces gens-l� sont fous,� se disait-il, �de planter leurs artichauts dans
[30]le voisinage du lion.... car enfin, je n'ai pas r�v�....
Les lions viennent jusqu'ici.... En voil� la preuve....�

La preuve, c'�taient des taches de sang que la b�te en fuyant
avait laiss�es derri�re elle. Pench� sur cette piste sanglante, l'oeil

Page 47

aux aguets, le revolver au poing, le vaillant Tarasconnais arriva,
d'artichaut en artichaut, jusqu'� un petit champ d'avoine....
De l'herbe foul�e, une mare de sang, et, au milieu de la mare,
couch� sur le flanc avec une large plaie � la t�te, un....
[5]Devinez quoi!...

�Un lion, parbleu!...�

Non! un �ne, un de ces tout petits �nes qui sont si communs
en Alg�rie et qu'on d�signe l�-bas sous le nom de _bourriquots_.


VI


_Arriv�e de la femelle. Terrible combat.
Le Rendez-vous des Lapins._


Le premier mouvement de Tartarin � l'aspect de sa malheureuse
[10]victime fut un mouvement de d�pit. Il y a si loin en effet
d'un lion � un _bourriquot!_.... Son second mouvement fut tout
� la piti�. Le pauvre bourriquot �tait si joli; il avait l'air si bon!
La peau de ses flancs, encore chaude, allait et venait comme une
vague. Tartarin s'agenouilla, et du bout de sa ceinture alg�rienne
[15]essaya d'�tancher le sang de la malheureuse b�te; et ce
grand homme soignant ce petit �ne, c'�tait tout ce que vous
pouvez imaginer de plus touchant.

Au contact soyeux de la ceinture, le bourriquot, qui avait
encore pour deux liards de vie, ouvrit son grand oeil gris, remua
[20]deux ou trois fois ses longues oreilles comme pour dire:
�Merci!... merci!...� Puis une derni�re convulsion l'agita
de t�te en queue et il ne bougea plus.

�Noiraud! Noiraud!� cria tout � coup une voix �trangl�e
par l'angoisse. En m�me temps dans un taillis voisin les branches
[25]remu�rent.... Tartarin n'eut que le temps de se relever et
de se mettre en garde.... C'�tait la femelle!

Elle arriva, terrible et rugissante, sous les traits d'une vieille
Alsacienne en marmotte, arm�e d'un grand parapluie rouge et

Page 48

r�clamant son �ne � tous les �chos de Mustapha. Certes il aurait
mieux valu pour Tartarin avoir affaire � une lionne en furie
qu'� cette m�chante vieille.... Vainement le malheureux essaya
de lui faire entendre comment la chose s'�tait pass�e; qu'il avait
[5]pris Noiraud pour un lion.... La vieille crut qu'on voulait se
moquer d'elle, et poussant d'�nergiques �tarteifle!� tomba sur
le h�ros � coups de parapluie. Tartarin, un peu confus, se
d�fendait de son mieux, parait les coups avec sa carabine,
suait, soufflait, bondissait, criait:--�Mais Madame ... mais
[10]Madame....�

Va te promener! Madame �tait sourde, et sa vigueur le
prouvait bien.

Heureusement un troisi�me personnage arriva sur le champ
de bataille. C'�tait le mari de l'Alsacienne, Alsacien lui-m�me
[15]et cabaretier; de plus, fort bon comptable. Quand il vit � qui il
avait affaire, et que l'assassin ne demandait qu'� payer le prix
de la victime, il d�sarma son �pouse et l'on s'entendit.

Tartarin donna deux cents francs: l'�ne en valait bien dix.
C'est le prix courant des _bourriquots_ sur les march�s arabes.
[20]Puis on enterra le pauvre Noiraud au pied d'un figuier, et
l'Alsacien, mis en bonne humeur par la couleur des douros
tarasconnais, invita le h�ros � venir rompre une cro�te � son
cabaret, qui se trouvait � quelques pas de l�, sur le bord de la
grande route.

[25]Les chasseurs alg�riens venaient y d�jeuner tous les dimanches
car la plaine �tait giboyeuse et � deux lieues autour
de la ville il n'y avait pas de meilleur endroit pour les lapins.

�Et les lions?� demanda Tartarin.
L'Alsacien le regarda, tr�s �tonn�: �Les lions?
[30]--Oui ... les lions ... en voyez-vous quelquefois?� reprit
le pauvre homme avec un peu moins d'assurance.
Le cabaretier �clata de rire:

Page 49

�Ah! ben! merci.... Des lions ... pourquoi faire?...

--Il n'y en a donc pas en Alg�rie?...

--Ma foi! je n'en ai jamais vu.... Et pourtant voil� vingt
ans que j'habite la province. Cependant je crois bien avoir
[5]entendu dire.... Il me semble que les journaux.... Mais
c'est beaucoup plus loin, l�-bas, dans le Sud....�

A ce moment, ils arrivaient au cabaret. Un cabaret de banlieue,
comme on en voit � Vanves ou � Pantin, avec un rameau
tout fan� au-dessus de la porte, des queues de billard peintes
[10]sur les murs et cette enseigne inoffensive:

AU RENDEZ-VOUS DES LAPINS

Le Rendez-vous des Lapins!... O Bravida, quel souvenir!


VII


_Histoire d'un omnibus, d'une Mauresque
et d'un chapelet de fleurs de jasmin._


Cette premi�re aventure aurait eu de quoi d�courager bien
des gens; mais les hommes tremp�s comme Tartarin ne se
[15]laissent pas facilement abattre.

�Les lions sont dans le Sud,� pensa le h�ros; �eh bien!
j'irai dans le Sud.�

Et d�s qu'il eut aval� son dernier morceau, il se leva, remercia
son h�te, embrassa la vieille sans rancune, versa une derni�re
[20]larme sur l'infortun� Noiraud, et retourna bien vite � Alger avec
la ferme intention de boucler ses malles et de partir le jour
m�me pour le Sud.

Malheureusement la grande route de Mustapha semblait s'�tre
allong�e depuis la veille: il faisait un soleil, une poussi�re! La
[25]tente-abri �tait d'un lourd!... Tartarin ne se sentit pas le

Page 50

courage d'aller � pied jusqu'� la ville, et le premier omnibus qui
passa, il fit signe et monta dedans....

Ah! pauvre Tartarin de Tarascon! Combien il aurait mieux
fait pour son nom, pour sa gloire, de ne pas entrer dans cette
[5]fatale guimbarde et de continuer p�destrement sa route, au risque
de tomber asphyxi� sous le poids de l'atmosph�re, de la tente-abri
et de ses lourds fusils ray�s � doubles canons....

Tartarin �tant mont�, L'omnibus fut complet. Il y avait au
fond, le nez dans son br�viaire, un vicaire d'Alger � grande
[10]barbe noire. En face, un jeune marchand maure, qui fumait de
grosses cigarettes. Puis, un matelot maltais, et quatre ou cinq
Mauresques masqu�es de linges blancs, et dont on ne pouvait
voir que les yeux. Ces dames venaient de faire leurs d�votions
an cimeti�re d'Abd-el-Kader; mais cette visite fun�bre ne semblait
[15]pas les avoir attrist�es. On les entendait rire et jacasser
entre elles sous leurs masques, en croquant des p�tisseries.

Tartarin crut s'apercevoir qu'elles le regardaient beaucoup.
Une surtout, celle qui �tait assise en face de lui, avait plant�
son regard dans le sien, et ne le retira pas de toute la route.
[20]Quoique la dame f�t voil�e, la vivacit� de ce grand oeil noir
allong� par le k'hol, un poignet d�licieux et fin charg� de bracelets
d'or qu'on entrevoyait de temps en temps entre les voiles,
tout, le son de la voix, les mouvements gracieux, presque enfantins
de la t�te, disait qu'il y avait l�-dessous quelque chose de
[25]jeune, de joli, d'adorable ... Le malheureux Tartarin ne
savait o� se fourrer. La caresse muette de ces beaux yeux
d'Orient le troublait, l'agitait, le faisait mourir; il avait chaud,
il avait froid....

Pour l'achever, la pantoufle de la dame s'en m�la: sur ses
[30]grosses bottes de chasse, il la sentait courir, cette mignonne
pantoufle courir et fr�tiller comme une petite souris rouge....
Que faire? R�pondre � ce regard, � cette pression! Oui, mais
les cons�quences.... Une intrigue d'amour en Orient, c'est

Page 51

quelque chose de terrible!... Et avec son imagination romanesque
et m�ridionale, le brave Tarasconnais se voyait d�j�
tombant aux mains des eunuques, d�capit�, mieux que cela
peut-�tre, cousu dans un sac de cuir, et roulant sur la mer, sa
[5]t�te � c�t� de lui. Cela le refroidissait un peu.... En attendant,
la petite pantoufle continuait son man�ge, et les yeux
d'en face s'ouvraient tout grands vers lui comme deux fleurs
de velours noir, en ayant l'air de dire:

--Cueille-nous!...

[10]L'omnibus s'arr�ta. On �tait sur la place du Th��tre, �
l'entr�e de la rue Bab-Azoun. Une � une, emp�tr�es dans leurs
grands pantalons et serrant leurs voiles contre elles avec une
gr�ce sauvage, les Mauresques descendirent. La voisine de
Tartarin se leva la derni�re, et en se levant son visage passa si
[15]pr�s de celui du h�ros qu'il l'effleura de son haleine, un vrai
bouquet de jeunesse, de jasmin, de musc et de p�tisserie.

Le Tarasconnais n'y r�sista pas. Ivre d'amour et pr�t � tout,
il s'�lan�a derri�re la Mauresque.... Au bruit de ses buffleteries
elle se retourna, mit un doigt sur son masque comme pour
[20]dire �chut!� et vivement, de l'autre main, elle lui jeta un petit
chapelet parfum�, fait avec des fleurs de jasmin. Tartarin de
Tarascon se baissa pour le ramasser; mais, comme notre h�ros
�tait un peu lourd et tr�s charg� d'armures, I'op�ration fut assez
longue....

[25]Quand il se releva, le chapelet de jasmin sur son coeur,--la
Mauresque avait disparu.

_Lions de l'Atlas, dormez!_


Lions de I'Atlas, dormez! Dormez tranquilles au fond de
vos retraites, dans les alo�s et les cactus sauvages.... De
quelques jours encore, Tartarin de Tarascon ne vous massacrera
[30]point. Pour le moment, tout son attirail de guerre,

Page 52

--caisses d'armes, pharmacie, tente-abri, conserves alimentaires,
--repose paisiblement emball�, � l'h�tel d'Europe, dans un coin
de la chambre 36.

Dormez sans peur, grands lions roux! Le Tarasconnais
[5]cherche sa Mauresque. Depuis l'histoire de l'omnibus, le
malheureux croit sentir perp�tuellement sur son pied, sur son vaste
pied de trappeur, les fr�tillements de la petite souris rouge; et
la brise de mer, en effleurant ses l�vres, se parfume toujours
--quoi qu'il fasse--d'une amoureuse odeur de p�tisserie et d'anis.

[10]Il lui faut sa Maugrabine!

Mais ce n'est pas une mince affaire! Retrouver dans une
ville de cent mille �mes une personne dont on ne conna�t que
l'haleine, les pantoufles et la couleur des yeux; il n'y a qu'un
Tarasconnais, f�ru d'amour, capable de tenter une pareille
[15]aventure.

Le terrible c'est que, sous leurs grands masques blancs, toutes
les Mauresques se ressemblent; puis ces dames ne sortent gu�re,
et, quand on veut en voir, il faut monter dans la ville haute, la
ville arabe, la ville des _Teurs_.

[20]Un vrai coupe-gorge, cette ville haute. De petites ruelles
noires tr�s �troites, grimpant � pic entre deux rang�es de maisons
myst�rieuses dont les toitures se rejoignent et font tunnel.
Des portes basses, des fen�tres toutes petites, muettes, tristes,
grillag�es. Et puis, de droite et de gauche, un tas d'�choppes
[25]tr�s sombres o� les _Teurs_ farouches � t�tes de forbans
--yeux blancs et dents brillantes--fument de longues pipes,
et se parlent � voix basse comme pour concerter de mauvais
coups....

Dire que notre Tartarin traversait sans �motion cette cit�
[30]formidable, ce serait mentir. Il �tait au contraire tr�s �mu,
et dans ces ruelles obscures dont son gros ventre tenait toute la
largeur, le brave homme n'avan�ait qu'avec la plus grande pr�caution,
l'oeil aux aguets, le doigt sur la d�tente d'un revolver.

Page 53

Tout � fait comme � Tarascon, en allant au cercle. A chaque
instant il s'attendait � recevoir sur le dos toute une d�gringolade
d'eunuques et de janissaires, mais le d�sir de revoir sa dame lui
donnait une audace et une force de g�ant.

[5]Huit jours durant, l'intr�pide Tartarin ne quitta pas la ville
haute. Tant�t on le voyait faire le pied de grue devant les bains
maures, attendant l'heure o� ces dames sortent par bandes, frissonnantes
et sentant le bain; tant�t il apparaissait accroupi �
la porte des mosqu�es, suant et soufflant pour quitter ses grosses
[10]bottes avant d'entrer dans le sanctuaire....

Parfois, � la tomb�e de la nuit, quand il s'en revenait navr�
de n'avoir rien d�couvert, pas plus au bain qu'� la mosqu�e, le
Tarasconnais, en passant devant les maisons mauresques, entendait des
chants monotones, des sons �touff�s de guitare, des
[15]roulements de tambours de basque, et des petits rires de femme
qui lui faisaient battre le coeur.

�Elle est peut-�tre l�!� se disait-il.

Alors, si la rue �tait d�serte, il s'approchait d'une de ces
maisons, levait le lourd marteau de la poterne basse, et frappait
[20]timidement.... Aussit�t les chants, les rires cessaient. On
n'entendait plus derri�re la muraille que de petits chuchotements
vagues, comme dans une voli�re endormie.

�Tenons-nous bien!� pensait le h�ros.... �Il va m'arriver
quelque chose!�

[25]Ce qui lui arrivait le plus souvent, c'�tait une grande pot�e
d'eau froide sur la t�te, ou bien des peaux d'oranges et de figues
de Barbarie.... Jamais rien de plus grave....

Lions de l'Atlas, dormez!

_Le prince Gr�gory du Mont�n�gro._


Page 54

Il y avait deux grandes semaines que l'infortun� Tartarin
cherchait sa dame alg�rienne, et tr�s vraisemblablement il la
chercherait encore, si la Providence des amants n'�tait venue �
son aide sous les traits d'un gentilhomme mont�n�grin. Voici:
[5]En hiver, toutes les nuits de samedi, le grand th��tre d'Alger
donne son bal masqu�, ni plus ni moins que l'Op�ra. C'est
l'�ternel et insipide bal masqu� de province. Peu de monde
dans la salle, quelques �paves de Bullier ou du Casino, vierges
folles suivant l'arm�e, chicards fan�s, d�bardeurs en d�route, et
[10]cinq ou six petites blanchisseuses mahonnaises qui se lancent,
mais gardent de leur temps de vertu un vague parfum d'ail et
de sauces safran�es.... Le vrai coup d'oeil n'est pas l�. Il
est au foyer, transform� pour la circonstance en salon de jeu....
Une foule fi�vreuse et bariol�e s'y bouscule, autour des
[15]longs tapis verts: des turcos en permission misant les gros sous
du pr�t, des Maures marchands de la ville haute, des n�gres,
des Maltais, des colons de l'int�rieur qui ont fait quarante lieues
pour venir hasarder sur un as l'argent d'une charrue ou d'un
couple de boeufs.... tous fr�missants, p�les, les dents serr�es,
[20]avec ce regard singulier du joueur, trouble, en biseau, devenu
louche � force de fixer toujours la m�me carte.

Plus loin, ce sont des tribus de juifs alg�riens, jouant en famille.
Les hommes out le costume oriental hideusement agr�ment�
de bas bleus et de casquettes de velours. Les femmes,
[25]bouffies et blafardes, se tiennent toutes raides dans leurs
�troits plastrons d'or.... Group�e autour des tables, toute la tribu
piaille, se concerte, compte sur ses doigts et joue peu. De
temps en temps seulement, apr�s de longs conciliabules, un
vieux patriarche � barbe de P�re �ternel se d�tache, et va risquer
[30]le douro familial.... C'est alors, tant que la partie dure<

Page 55

un scintillement d'yeux h�bra�ques tourn�s vers la table, terribles
yeux d'aimant noir qui font fr�tiller les pi�ces d'or sur
le tapis et finissent par les attirer tout doucement comme par
un fil....

[5]Puis des querelles, des batailles, des jurons de tous les pays,
des cris fous dans toutes les langues, des couteaux qu'on d�ga�ne,
la garde qui monte, de l'argent qui manque!...

C'est au milieu de ces saturnales que le grand Tartarin �tait
venu s'�garer un soir, pour chercher l'oubli et la paix de coeur.

[10]Le h�ros s'en allait seul, dans la foule, pensant � sa Mauresque,
quand tout � coup, � une table de jeu, par-dessus les
cris, le bruit de l'or, deux voix irrit�es s'�lev�rent:

�Je vous dis qu'il me manque vingt francs, M'sieu!...

--M'sieu!...

[15]--Apr�s?... M'sieu!...

--Apprenez � qui vous parlez, M'sieu!

--Je ne demande pas mieux, M'sieu!

--Je suis le prince Gr�gory du Mont�n�gro, M'sieu!...�

A ce nom Tartarin, tout �mu, fendit la foule et vint se placer
[20]an premier rang, joyeux et fier de retrouver son prince, ce prince
mont�n�grin si poli dont il avait �bauch� la connaissance � bord
du paquebot....

Malheureusement, ce titre d'altesse, qui avait tant �bloui le
bon Tarasconnais, ne produisit pas la moindre impression sur
[25]l'officier de chasseurs avec qui le prince avait son algarade.

�Me voil� bien avanc�....� fit le militaire en ricanant; puis
se tournant vers la galerie: �Gr�gory du Mont�n�gro ... qui
conna�t �a?... Personne!�

Tartarin indign� fit un pas en avant.

[30]�Pardon ... je connais le _pr�ince!_� dit-il d'une voix tr�s
ferme, et de son plus bel accent tarasconnais.

L'officier de chasseurs le regarda un moment bien en face,
puis, levant les �paules:

Page 56

�Allons! c'est bon.... Partagez-vous les vingt francs qui
manquent et qu'il n'en soit plus question.�

L�-dessus il tourna le dos et se perdit dans la foule.

Le fougueux Tartarin voulait s'�lancer derri�re lui, mais le
[5]prince l'en emp�cha:

�Laissez ... j'en fais mon affaire.�

Et, prenant le Tarasconnais par le bras, il l'entra�na dehors
rapidement.

D�s qu'ils furent sur la place, le prince Gr�gory du Mont�n�gro
[10]se d�couvrit, tendit la main � notre h�ros, et, se rappelant
vaguement son nom, commen�a d'une voix vibrante:

�Monsieur Barbarin....

--Tartarin!� souffla l'autre timidement.

--Tartarin, Barbarin, n'importe!... Entre nous, maintenant,
[15]c'est � la vie, � la mort!�

Et le noble Mont�n�grin lui secoua la main avec une farouche
�nergie.... Vous pensez si le Tarasconnais �tait fier.

�_Pr�ince!... Pr�ince!..._� r�p�tait-il avec ivresse.

Un quart d'heure apr�s, ces deux messieurs �taient install�s
[20]au restaurant des Platanes, agr�able maison de nuit dont
les terrasses plongent sur la mer, et l�, devant une forte
salade russe arros�e d'un joli vin de Crescia, on renoua
connaissance.

Vous ne pouvez rien imaginer de plus s�duisant que ce prince
[25]mont�n�grin. Mince, fin, les cheveux cr�pus, fris� au petit fer,
ras� � la pierre ponce, constell� d'ordres bizarres, il avait l'oeil
fut�, le geste c�lin et un accent vaguement italien qui lui donnait un
faux air de Mazarin sans moustaches; tr�s ferr� d'ailleurs
sur les langues latines, et citant � tout propos Tacite,
[30]Horace et les Commentaires.

De vieille race h�r�ditaire, ses fr�res l'avaient, para�t-il, exil�
d�s l'�ge de dix ans, � cause de ses opinions lib�rales, et depuis
il courait le monde pour son instruction et son plaisir, en Altesse

Page 57

philosophe.... Co�ncidence singuli�re! Le prince avait pass�
trois ans � Tarascon, et comme Tartarin s'�tonnait de ne l'avoir
jamais rencontr� au cercle ou sur I'Esplanade: �Je sortais
Peu....� fit l'Altesse d'un ton �vasif. Et le Tarasconnais,
[5]par discr�tion, n'osa pas en demander davantage. Toutes ces
grandes existences out des c�t�s si myst�rieux!...

En fin de compte, un tr�s bon prince, ce seigneur Gr�gory.
Tout en sirotant le vin ros� de Crescia, il �couta patiemment
Tartarin lui parler de sa Mauresque et m�me il se fit fort, connaissant
[10]toutes ces dames, de la retrouver promptement.

On but sec et longtemps. On trinqua �aux dames d'Alger!
au Mont�n�gro libre!...�

Dehors sous la terrasse, la mer roulait, et les vagues, dans
l'ombre, battaient la rive avec un bruit de draps mouill�s qu'on
[15]secoue. L'air �tait chaud, le ciel plein d'�toiles.

Dans les platanes, un rossignol chantait....

Ce fut Tartarin qui paya la note.


X


_Dis-moi le nom de ton p�re, et je te dirai
le nom de cette fleur._


Parlez-moi des princes mont�n�grins pour lever lestement
la caille.

[20]Le lendemain de cette soir�e aux Platanes, d�s le petit jour,
le prince Gr�gory �tait dans la chambre du Tarasconnais.

�Vite, vite, habillez-vous.... Votre Mauresque est retrouv�e....
Elle s'appelle Ba�a.... Vingt ans, jolie comme un coeur,
et d�j� veuve....

[25]--Veuve!... quelle chance!� fit joyeusement le brave
Tartarin, qui se m�fiait des maris d'Orient.

�Oui, mais tr�s surveill�e par son fr�re.

--Ah! diantre!...

Page 58

--Un Maure farouche qui vend des pipes au bazar
d'Orl�ans....�

Ici un silence.

�Bon!� reprit le prince, �vous n'�tes pas homme � vous
[5]effrayer pour si peu; et puis on viendra peut-�tre � bout de ce
forban en lui achetant quelques pipes.... Allons vite,
habillez-vous ... heureux coquin!�

P�le, �mu, le coeur plein d'amour, le Tarasconnais sauta
de son lit et, boutonnant � la h�te son vaste cale�on de
[10]flanelle:

�Qu'est-ce qu'il faut que je fasse?

--�crire � la dame tout simplement, et lui demander un
rendez-vous!

--Elle sait donc le fran�ais?...� fit d'un air d�sappoint�
[15]le na�f Tartarin qui r�vait d'Orient sans m�lange.

�Elle n'en sait pas un mot,� r�pondit le prince imperturbablement....
�mais vous allez me dicter la lettre, et je traduirai
� mesure.

--O prince, que de bont�s!�

[20]Et le Tarasconnais se mit � marcher � grands pas dans la
chambre, silencieux et se recueillant.

Vous pensez qu'on n'�crit pas � une Mauresque d'Alger
comme � une grisette de Beaucaire. Fort heureusement que
notre h�ros avait par devers lui ses nombreuses lectures qui
[25]lui permirent, en amalgamant la rh�torique apache des Indiens
de Gustave Aimard avec le _Voyage en Orient_ de Lamartine, et
quelques lointaines r�miniscences du _Cantique des Cantiques_, de
composer la lettre la plus orientale qu'il se p�t voir. Cela
commen�ait par:

[30]�_Comme l'autruche dans les sables _....�

Et finissait par:

�_Dis-moi le nom de ton p�re, et je te dirai le nom de cette
fleur _....�

Page 59

A cet envoi, le romanesque Tartarin aurait bien voulu joindre
un bouquet de fleurs embl�matiques, � la mode orientale; mais
le prince Gr�gory pensa qu'il valait mieux acheter quelques pipes
chez le fr�re, ce qui ne manquerait pas d'adoucir l'humeur
[5]sauvage du monsieur et ferait certainement tr�s grand plaisir �
la dame, qui fumait beaucoup.

�Allons vite acheter des pipes!� fit Tartarin plein d'ardeur.

�Non!... non!... Laissez-moi y aller seul. Je les aurai
� meilleur compte....

[10]--Comment! vous voulez ... O prince ... prince....�
Et le brave homme, tout confus, tendit sa bourse � l'obligeant
Mont�n�grin, en lui recommandant de ne rien n�gliger pour
que la dame f�t contente.

Malheureusement l'affaire--quoique bien lanc�e--ne marcha
[15]pas aussi vite qu'on aurait pu l'esp�rer. Tr�s touch�e,
para�t-il, de l'�loquence de Tartarin et du reste aux trois quarts
s�duite par avance, la Mauresque n'aurait pas mieux demand�
que de le recevoir; mais le fr�re avait des scrupules, et, pour
les endormir, il fallut acheter des douzaines, des grosses, des
[20]cargaisons de pipes....

�Qu'est-ce que diable Ba�a peut faire de toutes ces pipes?�
se demandait parfois le pauvre Tartarin;--mais il payait quand
m�me et sans l�siner.

Enfin, apr�s avoir achet� des montagnes de pipes et r�pandu
[25]des flots de po�sie orientale, on obtint un rendez-vous.

Je n'ai pas besoin de vous dire avec quels battements de coeur
le Tarasconnais s'y pr�para, avec quel soin �mu il tailla, lustra,
parfuma sa rude barbe de chasseur de casquettes, sans oublier
--car il faut tout pr�voir--de glisser dans sa poche un casse-t�te
[30]� pointes et deux ou trois revolvers.

Le prince, toujours obligeant, vint � ce premier rendez-vous
en qualit� d'interpr�te. La dame habitait dans le haut de la
ville. Devant sa porte, un jeune Maure de treize � quatorze

Page 60

ans fumait des cigarettes. C'�tait le fameux Ali, le fr�re en
question. En voyant arriver les deux visiteurs, il frappa deux
coups � la poterne et se retira discr�tement.

La porte s'ouvrit. Une n�gresse parut qui, sans dire un seul
[5]mot, conduisit ces messieurs � travers l'�troite cour int�rieure
dans une petite chambre fra�che o� la dame attendait, accoud�e
sur un lit bas.... Au premier abord, elle parut au Tarasconnais
plus petite et plus forte que la Mauresque de l'omnibus.

Au fait, �tait-ce bien la m�me? Mais ce soup�on ne fit
[10]que traverser le cerveau de Tartarin comme un �clair.

La dame �tait si jolie ainsi avec ses pieds nus, ses doigts
grassouillets charg�s de bagues, rose, fine, et sous son corselet
de drap dor�, sous les ramages de sa robe � fleurs laissant deviner
une aimable personne un peu boulotte, friande � point, et
[15]ronde de partout....Le tuyau d'ambre d'un narghil� fumait
� ses l�vres et l'enveloppait toute d'une gloire de fum�e blonde.

En entrant, le Tarasconnais posa une main sur son coeur, et
s'inclina le plus mauresquement possible, en roulant de gros
yeux passionn�s.... Ba�a le regarda un moment sans
[20]dire; puis, l�chant son tuyau d'ambre, se renversa en arri�re,
cacha sa t�te dans ses mains, et I'on ne vit plus que son cou
blanc qu'un fou rire faisait danser comme un sac rempli de
perles.


XI


_Sidi Tart'ri ben Tart'ri._


Si vous entriez, un soir, � la veill�e, chez les cafetiers alg�riens
[25]de la ville haute, vous entendriez encore aujourd'hui les Maures
causer entre eux, avec des clignements d'yeux et de petits rires,
d'un certain Sidi Tart'ri ben Tart'ri, Europ�en aimable et riche
qui--voici quelques ann�es d�j�--vivait dans les hauts quartiers
avec une petite dame du cru appel�e Ba�a.

Page 61

Le Sidi Tart'ri en question qui a laiss� de si gais souvenirs
autour de la Casbah n'est autre, on le devine, que notre Tartarin....

Qu'est-ce que vous voulez? Il y a comme cela, dans la vie
[5]des saints et des h�ros, des heures d'aveuglement, de trouble,
de d�faillance. L'illustre Tarasconnais n'en fut pas plus exempt
qu'un autre, et c'est pourquoi--deux mois durant--oublieux
des lions et de la gloire, il se grisa d'amour oriental et s'endormit,
comme Annibal � Capoue, dans les d�lices d'Alger la Blanche.

[10]Le brave homme avait lou� au coeur de la ville arabe une
jolie maisonnette indig�ne avec cour int�rieure, bananiers, galeries
fra�ches et fontaines. Il vivait l� loin de tout bruit en compagnie
de sa Mauresque, Maure lui-m�me de la t�te aux pieds,
soufflant tout le jour dans son narghil�, et mangeant des confitures
[15]au musc.

�tendue sur un divan en face de lui, Ba�a, la guitare au poing,
nasillait des airs monotones, ou bien pour distraire son seigneur
elle mimait la danse du ventre, en tenant � la main un petit
miroir dans lequel elle mirait ses dents blanches et se faisait
[20]des mines.

Comme la dame ne savait pas un mot de fran�ais ni Tartarin
un mot d'arabe, la conversation languissait quelquefois, et le bavard
Tarasconnais avait tout le temps de faire p�nitence pour
les intemp�rances de langage dont il s'�tait rendu coupable � la
[25]pharmacie B�zuquet ou chez l'armurier Costecalde.

Mais cette p�nitence m�me ne manquait pas de charme, et
c'�tait comme un spleen voluptueux qu'il �prouvait � rester l�
tout le jour sans parler, en �coutant le glouglou du narghil�, le
fr�lement de la guitare et le bruit l�ger de la fontaine dans les
[30]mosa�ques de la cour.

Le narghil�, le bain, l'amour remplissaient toute sa vie. On
sortait peu. Quelquefois Sidi Tart'ri, sa dame en croupe, s'en
allait sur une brave mule manger des grenades � un petit

Page 62

jardin qu'il avait achet� aux environs.... Mais jamais, au
grand jamais, il ne descendait dans la ville europ�enne. Avec
ses zouaves en ribotte, ses alcazars bourr�s d'officiers, et son
�ternel bruit de sabres tra�nant sous les arcades, cet Alger-l�
[5]lui semblait insupportable et laid comme un corps de garde
d'Occident.

En somme, le Tarasconnais �tait tr�s heureux. Tartarin-Sancho surtout,
tr�s friand de p�tisseries turques, se d�clarait
on ne peut plus satisfait de sa nouvelle existence....
[10]Tartarin-Quichotte, lui, avait bien par-ci par-l� quelques remords,
en pensant � Tarascon et aux peaux promises.... Mais cela ne durait
pas, et pour chasser ces tristes id�es il suffisait d'un regard de
Ba�a ou d'une cuiller�e de ses diaboliques confitures odorantes
et troublantes comme les breuvages de Circ�.

[15]Le soir, le prince Gr�gory venait parler un peu du Mont�n�gro
libre.... D'une complaisance infatigable, cet aimable
seigneur remplissait dans la maison les fonctions d'interpr�te,
au besoin m�me celles d'intendant, et tout cela pour rien, pour
le plaisir.... A part lui, Tartarin ne recevait que des _Teurs._
[20]Tous ces forbans � t�tes farouches, qui nagu�re lui faisaient
tant de peur du fond de leurs noires �choppes, se trouv�rent
�tre, une fois qu'il les connut, de bons commer�ants inoffensifs,
des brodeurs, des marchands d'�pices, des tourneurs de tuyaux
de pipes, tous gens bien �lev�s, humbles, finauds, discrets et de
[25]premi�re force � la bouillotte. Quatre ou cinq fois par semaine,
ces messieurs venaient passer la soir�e chez Sidi Tart'ri, lui
gagnaient son argent, lui mangeaient ses confitures, et sur le
coup de dix heures se retiraient discr�tement en remerciant
le Proph�te.

[30]Derri�re eux, Sidi Tart'ri et sa fid�le �pouse finissaient la
soir�e sur leur terrasse, une grande terrasse blanche qui faisait
toit � la maison et dominait la ville. Tout autour, un millier
d'autres terrasses blanches aussi, tranquilles sous le clair de lune,

Page 63

descendaient en s'�chelonnant jusqu'� la mer. Des fredons de
guitare arrivaient, port�s par la brise.

....Soudain, comme un bouquet d'�toiles, une grande m�lodie
claire s'�grenait doucement dans le ciel, et, sur le minaret de la
[5]mosqu�e voisine, un beau muezzin apparaissait, d�coupant son
ombre blanche dans le bleu profond de la nuit, et chantant
la gloire d'Allah avec une voix merveilleuse qui remplissait
l'horizon.

Aussit�t Ba�a l�chait sa guitare, et ses grands yeux tourn�s
[10]vers le muezzin semblaient boire la pri�re avec d�lices. Tant
que le chant durait, elle restait l�, frissonnante, extasi�e, comme
une sainte Th�r�se d'Orient.... Tartarin, tout �mu, la regardait
prier et pensait en lui-m�me que c'�tait une forte et belle
religion, celle qui pouvait causer des ivresses de foi pareilles.

[15]Tarascon, voile-toi la face! ton Tartarin songeait � se faire
ren�gat.


XII


_On nous �crit de Tarascon._


Par une belle apr�s-midi de ciel bleu et de brise ti�de, Sidi
Tart'ri � califourchon sur sa mule revenait tout seulet de son
petit clos.... Les jambes �cart�es par de larges coussins en
[20]sparterie que gonflaient les c�drats et les past�ques, berc� au
bruit de ses grands �triers et suivant de tout son corps le
_balin-balan_ de la b�te, le brave homme s'en allait ainsi dans un
paysage adorable, les deux mains crois�es sur son ventre, aux trois
quarts assoupi par le bien �tre et la chaleur.

[25]Tout � coup, en entrant dans la ville, un appel formidable le
r�veilla.

�H�! monstre de sort! on dirait monsieur Tartarin.�

A ce nom de Tartarin, � cet accent joyeusement m�ridional,
le Tarasconnais leva la t�te et aper�ut � deux pas de lui la

Page 64

brave figure tann�e de ma�tre Barbassou, le capitaine du
_Zouave_, qui prenait l'absinthe en fumant sa pipe sur la porte
d'un petit caf�.

�H�! adieu, Barbassou,� fit Tartarin en arr�tant sa mule.

[5]Au lieu de lui r�pondre, Barbassou le regarda un moment
avec de grands yeux; puis, le voil� parti � rire, � rire tellement,
Que Sidi Tart'ri en resta tout interloqu�, le derri�re sur
ses past�ques.

�Qu� turban, mon pauvre monsieur Tartarin!... C'est
[10]donc vrai ce qu'on dit, que vous vous �tes fait _Teur?..._
Et la petite Ba�a, est-ce qu'elle chante toujours _Marco la Belle?_

--_Marco la Belle! _� fit Tartarin indign�.... �Apprenez,
capitaine, que la personne dont vous parlez est une honn�te
fille maure, et qu'elle ne sait pas un mot de fran�ais.

[15]--Ba�a, pas un mot de fran�ais?... D'o� sortez-vous
donc?...�

Et le brave capitaine se remit � rire plus fort.

Puis voyant la mine du pauvre Sidi Tart'ri qui s'allongeait,
il se ravisa.

[20]�Au fait, ce n'est peut-�tre pas la m�me.... Mettons que
j'ai confondu. Seulement, voyez-vous, monsieur Tartarin, vous
ferez tout de m�me bien de vous m�fier des Mauresques alg�riennes
et des princes du Mont�n�gro!...�

Tartarin se dressa sur ses �triers, en faisant sa moue.

[25]�Le prince est mon ami, capitaine.

--Bon! bon! ne nous f�chons pas.... Vous ne prenez pas
une absinthe? Non. Rien � faire dire au pays?... Non
plus.... Eh bien! alors, bon voyage.... A propos, coll�gue,
j'ai l� du bon tabac de France, si vous en vouliez emporter
quelques pipes.... Prenez [30]donc! prenez donc! �a vous
fera du bien.... Ce sont vos sacr�s tabacs d'Orient qui vous
barbouillent les id�es.�

Page 65

L�-dessus le capitaine retourna � son absinthe et Tartarin,
tout pensif, reprit au petit trot le chemin de sa maisonnette....
Bien que sa grande �me se refus�t � rien en croire, les insinuations de
Barbassou l'avaient attrist�, puis ces jurons du cru,
[5]l'accent de l�-bas, tout cela �veillait en lui de vagues remords.

Au logis, il ne trouva personne. Ba�a �tait au bain.... La
n�gresse lui parut laide, la maison triste.... En proie � une
ind�finissable m�lancolie, il vint s'asseoir pr�s de la fontaine et
bourra une pipe avec le tabac de Barbassou. Ce tabac �tait
[10]envelopp� dans un fragment du _S�maphore_. En le d�ployant,
le nom de sa ville natale lui sauta aux yeux.

_On nous �crit de Tarascon:_

�La ville est dans les transes. Tartarin, le tueur de lions, parti
pour chasser les grands f�lins en Afrique, n'a pas donn� de ses
[15]nouvelles depuis plusieurs mois.... Qu'est devenu notre h�ro�que
compatriote?...  On ose � peine se le demander, quand on a connu
comme nous cette t�te ardente, cette audace, ce besoin d'aventures....
A-t-il �t� comme tant d'autres englouti dans le sable, ou bien est-il
tomb� sous la dent meurtri�re d'un de ces monstres de l'Atlas dont
[20]il avait promis les peaux � la municipalit�?... Terrible incertitude!
Pourtant des marchands n�gres, venus � la foire de Beaucaire,
pr�tendent avoir rencontr� en plein d�sert un Europ�en dont le
signalement se rapportait au sien, et qui se dirigeait vers Tombouctou....
Dieu nous garde notre Tartarin!�

[25]Quand il lut cela, le Tarasconnais rougit, p�lit, frissonna. Tout
Tarascon lui apparut: le cercle, les chasseurs de casquettes, le
fauteuil vert chez Costecalde, et planant au-dessus comme un
aigle �ploy�, la formidable moustache du brave commandant
Bravida.

[30]Alors, de se voir l�, comme il �tait, l�chement accroupi sur
sa natte, tandis qu'on le croyait en train de massacrer des fauves,
Tartarin de Tarascon eut honte de lui-m�me et pleura.

Tout � coup le h�ros bondit:

�Au lion! au lion!�

Page 66

Et s'�lan�ant dans le r�duit poudreux o� dormaient la tente-abri,
la pharmacie, les conserves, la caisse d'armes, il les tra�na
au milieu de la cour.

Tartarin-Sancho venait d'expirer; il ne restait plus que
[5]Tartarin-Quichotte.

Le temps d'inspecter son mat�riel, de s'armer, de se harnacher,
de rechausser ses grandes bottes, d'�crire deux mots au
prince pour lui confier Ba�a, le temps de glisser sous l'enveloppe
quelques billets bleus mouill�s de larmes, et l'intr�pide
[10]Tarasconnais roulait en diligence sur la route de Blidah,
laissant � la maison sa n�gresse stup�faite devant le narghil�, le
turban, les babouches, toute la d�froque musulmane de Sidi
Tart'ri qui tra�nait piteusement sous les petits tr�fles blancs
de la galerie....




TROISIEME EPISODE



CHEZ LES LIONS


I


_Les diligences d�port�es._


Page 67

C'�tait une vieille diligence d'autrefois, capitonn�e � l'ancienne
mode de drap gros bleu tout fan�, avec ces �normes pompons
de laine r�che qui, apr�s quelques heures de route, finissent par
vous faire des moxas dans le dos.... Tartarin de Tarascon
[5]avait un coin de la rotonde; il s'y installa de son mieux, et en
attendant de respirer les �manations musqu�es des grands f�lins
d'Afrique, le h�ros dut se contenter de cette bonne vieille odeur
de diligence, bizarrement compos�e de mille odeurs, hommes,
chevaux, femmes et cuir, victuailles et paille moisie.

[10]Il y avait de tout un peu dans cette rotonde. Un trappiste,
des marchands juifs, deux cocottes qui rejoignaient leur corps
--le 3e hussards,--un photographe d'Orl�ansville.... Mais, si
charmante et vari�e que f�t la compagnie, le Tarasconnais n'�tait
pas en train de causer et resta l� tout pensif, le bras pass� dans
[15]la brassi�re, avec ses carabines entre ses genoux.... Son
d�part pr�cipit�, les yeux noirs de Ba�a, la terrible chasse qu'il
allait entreprendre, tout cela lui troublait la cervelle, sans compter
qu'avec son bon air patriarcal, cette diligence europ�enne,
retrouv�e en pleine Afrique, lui rappelait vaguement le Tarascon
[20]de sa jeunesse, des courses dans la banlieue, de petits d�ners au
bord du Rh�ne, une foule de souvenirs....

Peu � peu la nuit tomba. Le conducteur alluma ses lanternes.... La
diligence rouill�e sautait en criant sur ses vieux

Page 68

ressorts; les chevaux trottaient, les grelots tintaient.... De
temps en temps l�-haut, sous la b�che de l'imp�riale, un terrible
bruit de ferraille.... C'�tait le mat�riel de guerre.

Tartarin de Tarascon, aux trois quarts assoupi, resta un moment � regarder
[5]les voyageurs comiquement secou�s par les
cahots, et dansant devant lui comme des ombres falottes, puis
ses yeux s'obscurcirent, sa pens�e se voila, et il n'entendit plus
que tr�s vaguement geindre l'essieu des roues, et les flancs de
la diligence qui se plaignaient....

[10]Subitement, une voix, une voix de vieille f�e, enrou�e, cass�e,
f�l�e, appela le Tarasconnais par son nom: �Monsieur Tartarin!
monsieur Tartarin!

--Qui m'appelle?

--C'est moi, monsieur Tartarin; vous ne me reconnaissez
[15]pas?... Je suis la vieille diligence qui faisait--il y a vingt
ans--le service de Tarascon � N�mes.... Que de fois je vous
ai port�s, vous et vos amis, quand vous alliez chasser les casquettes
du c�t� de Joncqui�res ou de Bellegarde!... Je ne
vous ai pas remis d'abord, � cause de votre bonnet de _Teur_ et
[20]du corps que vous avez pris; mais sit�t que vous vous �tes mis
� ronfler, coquin de bon sort! je vous ai reconnu tout de suite.

--C'est bon! c'est bon!� fit le Tarasconnais un peu vex�.

Puis, se radoucissant:

--�Mais enfin, ma pauvre vieille, qu'est-ce que vous �tes
[25]venue faire ici?

--Ah! mon bon monsieur Tartarin, je n'y suis pas venue
de mon plein gr�, je vous assure.... Une fois que le chemin
de fer de Beaucaire a �t� fini, ils ne m'ont plus trouv�e bonne
� rien et ils m'ont envoy�e en Afrique.... Et je ne suis pas
[30]la seule! presque toutes les diligences de France ont �t�
d�port�es comme moi. On nous trouvait trop r�actionnaires, et maintenant
nous voil� toutes ici � mener une vie de gal�re.... C'est ce qu'en France
vous appelez les chemins de fer alg�riens.�

Page 69

Ici la vieille diligence poussa un long soupir; puis elle reprit:

�Ah! monsieur Tartarin, que je le regrette, mon beau Tarascon!
C'�tait alors le bon temps pour moi, le temps de la jeunesse!
il fallait me voir partir le matin, lav�e � grande eau et
[5]toute luisante avec mes roues verniss�es � neuf, mes lanternes
qui semblaient deux soleils et ma b�che toujours frott�e d'huile!
C'est �a qui �tait beau quand le postillon faisait claquer son
fouet sur l'air de: _Lagadigadeou, la Tarasque! la Tarasque!_
et que le conducteur, son piston en bandouli�re, sa casquette
[10]brod�e sur l'oreille, jetant d'un tour de bras son petit chien,
toujours furieux, sur la b�che de l'imp�riale, s'�lan�ait lui-m�me
l�-haut, en criant: �Allume! allume!� Alors mes quatre chevaux
s'�branlaient au bruit des grelots, des aboiements, des fanfares,
les fen�tres s'ouvraient, et tout Tarascon regardait avec
[15]orgueil la diligence d�taler sur la grande route royale.

Quelle belle route, monsieur Tartarin, large, bien entretenue,
avec ses bornes kilom�triques, ses petits tas de pierres r�guli�rement
espac�s, et de droite et de gauche ses jolies plaines
d'oliviers et de vignes.... Puis des auberges tous les dix pas,
[20]des relais toutes les cinq minutes.... Et mes voyageurs,
quelles braves gens! des maires et des cur�s qui allaient �
N�mes voir leur pr�fet ou leur �v�que, de bons taffetassiers qui
revenaient du _mazet_ bien honn�tement, des coll�giens en vacances,
des paysans en blouse brod�e tout frais ras�s du matin, et l�-haut,
[25]sur l'imp�riale, vous tous, messieurs les chasseurs de casquettes,
qui �tiez toujours de si bonne humeur, et qui chantiez si bien
chacun _la v�tre_, le soir, aux �toiles, en revenant!...

Maintenant c'est une autre histoire.... Dieu sait les gens
que je charrie! un tas de m�cr�ants venus je ne sais d'o�, qui
[30]me remplissent de vermine, des n�gres, des B�douins, des soudards,
des aventuriers de tous les pays, des colons en guenilles
qui m'empestent de leurs pipes, et tout cela parlant un langage
auquel Dieu le p�re ne comprendrait rien.... Et puis vous

Page 70

voyez comme on me traite! Jamais bross�e, jamais lav�e. On
me plaint le cambouis de mes essieux.... Au lieu de mes
gros bons chevaux tranquilles d'autrefois, de petits chevaux
arabes qui out le diable au corps, se battent, se mordent, dansent
[5]en courant comme des ch�vres, et me brisent mes brancards �
coups de pieds....  A�e!... a�e!... tenez!... Voil� que cela
Commence.... Et les routes! Par ici, c'est encore supportable,
parce que nous sommes pr�s du gouvernement, mais l�-bas,
plus rien, pas de chemin du tout. On va comme on peut,
[10]� travers monts et plaines, dans les palmiers nains, dans les
lentisques.... Pas un seul relais fixe. On arr�te au caprice du
conducteur, tant�t dans une ferme, tant�t dans une autre.

Quelquefois ce polisson-l� me fait faire un d�tour de deux
lieues pour aller chez un ami boire l'absinthe ou le _champoreau_....
[15]Apr�s quoi, fouette, postillon! il faut rattraper le
temps perdu. Le soleil cuit, la poussi�re br�le. Fouette toujours!
On accroche, on verse! Fouette plus fort! On passe des rivi�res
� la nage, on s'enrhume, on se mouille, on se noie.... Fouette!
fouette! fouette!... Puis le soir, toute ruisselante,--c'est
[20]cela qui est bon � mon �ge, avec mes rhumatismes!...--il
me faut coucher � la belle �toile, dans une cour de caravans�rail
ouverte � tous les vents. La nuit, des chacals, des hy�nes
viennent flairer mes caissons, et les maraudeurs qui craignent la
ros�e se mettent au chaud dans mes compartiments.... Voil�
[25]la vie que je m�ne, mon pauvre monsieur Tartarin, et je la
m�nerai jusqu'an jour o�, br�l�e par le soleil, pourrie par les
nuits humides, je tomberai--ne pouvant plus faire autrement
--sur un coin de m�chante route, o� les Arabes feront bouillir
leur kousskouss avec les d�bris de ma vieille carcasse....

[30]--Blidah! Blidah!� fit le conducteur en ouvrant la porti�re.

_ O� l'on voit passer un petit monsieur._


Page 71

Vaguement, � travers les vitres d�polies par la bu�e, Tartarin
de Tarascon entrevit une place de jolie sous-pr�fecture, place
r�guli�re, entour�e d'arcades et plant�e d'orangers, au milieu de
laquelle de petits soldats de plomb faisaient l'exercice dans la
[5]claire brume rose du matin. Les caf�s �taient leurs volets. Dans
un coin, une halle avec des l�gumes.... C'�tait charmant, mais
cela ne sentait pas encore le lion.

�Au sud!... Plus au sud!� murmura le bon Tartarin en
se renfon�ant dans son coin.

[10]A ce moment, la porti�re s'ouvrit. Une bouff�e d'air
frais entra, apportant sur ses ailes, dans le parfum des orangers
fleuris, un tout petit monsieur en redingote noisette, vieux, sec,
rid�, compass�, une figure grosse comme le poing, une cravate
en soie noire haute de cinq doigts, une serviette en cuir, un
[15]parapluie: le parfait notaire de village.

En apercevant le mat�riel de guerre du Tarasconnais, le petit
monsieur, qui s'�tait assis en face, parut excessivement surpris
et se mit � regarder Tartarin avec une insistance g�nante.

On d�tela, on attela, la diligence partit.... Le petit monsieur
[20]regardait toujours Tartarin.... A la fin le Tarasconnais
prit la mouche.

��a vous �tonne?� fit-il en regardant � son tour le petit
monsieur bien en face.

�Non! �a me g�ne,� r�pondit l'autre fort tranquillement; et
[25]le fait est qu'avec sa tente-abri, son revolver, ses deux fusils dans
dans leur gaine, son couteau de chasse,--sans parler de sa corpulence
naturelle, Tartarin de Tarascon tenait beaucoup de place....

La r�ponse du petit monsieur le f�cha:

�Vous imaginez-vous par hasard que je vais aller au lion avec
[30]votre parapluie?� dit le grand homme fi�rement.

Page 72

Le petit monsieur regarda son parapluie, sourit doucement;
puis, toujours avec son m�me flegme:

�Alors, monsieur, vous �tes...?

--Tartarin de Tarascon, tueur de lions!�

[5]En pronon�ant ces mots, l'intr�pide Tarasconnais secoua
comme une crini�re le gland de sa _ch�chia_.

Il y eut dans la diligence un mouvement de stupeur.

Le trappiste se signa, les cocottes pouss�rent de petits cris
d'effroi, et le photographe d'Orl�ansville se rapprocha du tueur
[10]de lions, r�vant d�j� l'insigne honneur de faire sa photographie.

Le petit monsieur, lui, ne se d�concerta pas.

�Est-ce que vous avez d�j� tu� beaucoup de lions, monsieur
Tartarin?� demanda-t-il tr�s tranquillement.

Le Tarasconnais le re�ut de la belle mani�re:

[15]�Si j'en ai beaucoup tu�, monsieur!... Je vous souhaiterais
d'avoir seulement autant de cheveux sur la t�te.�

Et toute la diligence de rire en regardant les trois cheveux
jaunes de Cadet-Roussel qui se h�rissaient sur le cr�ne du petit
monsieur.

[20]A son tour le photographe d'Orl�ansville prit la parole:

�Terrible profession que la v�tre, monsieur Tartarin!...
On passe quelquefois de mauvais moments.... Ainsi ce pauvre
M. Bombonnel....

--Ah! oui, le tueur de panth�res ...� fit Tartarin assez
[25]d�daigneusement.

�Est-ce que vous le connaissez?� demanda le petit monsieur.

�T�! pardi.... Si je le connais.... Nous avons chass�
plus de vingt fois ensemble.�

Le petit monsieur sourit: �Vous chassez donc la panth�re
[30]aussi, monsieur Tartarin?

--Quelquefois, par passe-temps, ...� fit l'enrag� Tarasconnais.
Il ajouta, en relevant la t�te d'un geste h�ro�que qui enflamma
le coeur des deux cocottes:

��a ne vaut pas le lion!

Page 73

--En somme,� hasarda le photographe d'Orl�ansville, �une
panth�re, ce n'est qu'un gros chat....

--Tout juste!� fit Tartarin qui n'�tait pas f�ch� de rabaisser
un peu la gloire de Bombonnel, surtout devant des dames.

[5]Ici la diligence s'arr�ta, le conducteur vint ouvrir la porti�re
et s'adressant au petit vieux:

�Vous voil� arriv�, monsieur,� lui dit-il d'un air tr�s respectueux.

Le petit monsieur se leva, descendit, puis avant de refermer
[10]la porti�re:

�Voulez-vous me permettre de vous donner un conseil, monsieur
Tartarin?

--Lequel, monsieur?

--Ma foi! �coutez, vous avez I'air d'un brave homme, j'aime
[15]mieux vous dire ce qu'il en est.... Retournez vite � Tarascon,
monsieur Tartarin.... Vous perdez votre temps ici.... Il
reste bien encore quelques panth�res dans la province; mais,
fi donc! c'est un trop petit gibier pour vous.... Quant aux
lions, c'est fini. Il n'en reste plus en Alg�rie ... mon ami
[20]Chassaing vient de tuer le dernier.�

Sur quoi le petit monsieur salua, ferma la porti�re, et s'en
alla en riant avec sa serviette et son parapluie.

�Conducteur,� demanda Tartarin en faisant sa moue,
�qu'est-ce que c'est donc que ce bonhomme-l�?

--Comment! vous ne le connaissez pas? mais c'est monsieur
[25]Bombonnel.�


III


_Un couvent de lions._


A Milianah, Tartarin de Tarascon descendit, laissant la
diligence continuer sa route vers le Sud.

Deux jours de durs cahots, deux nuits pass�es les yeux ouverts
[30]� regarder par la porti�re s'il n'apercevrait pas dans les

Page 74

champs, au bord de la route, l'ombre formidable du lion, tant
d'insomnies m�ritaient bien quelques heures de repos. Et puis,
s'il faut tout dire, depuis sa m�saventure avec Bombonnel, le
loyal Tarasconnais se sentait mal � l'aise, malgr� ses armes,
[5]sa moue terrible, son bonnet rouge, devant le photographe
d'Orl�ansville et les deux demoiselles du 3�me hussards.

Il se dirigea donc � travers les larges rues de Milianah, pleines
de beaux arbres et de fontaines, mais, tout en cherchant un
h�tel � sa convenance, le pauvre homme ne pouvait s'emp�cher
[10]de songer aux paroles de Bombonnel.... Si c'�tait vrai pourtant?
S'il n'y avait plus de lions en Alg�rie?... A quoi bon
alors tant de courses, tant de fatigues?...

Soudain, au d�tour d'une rue, notre h�ros se trouva face �
face ... avec qui? Devinez.... Avec un lion superbe, qui
[15]attendait devant la porte d'un caf�, assis royalement sur son
train de derri�re, sa crini�re fauve dans le soleil.

�Qu'est ce qu'ils me disaient donc qu'il n'y en avait plus?�
s'�cria le Tarasconnais en faisant un saut en arri�re.... En
entendant cette exclamation, le lion baissa la t�te et, prenant
[20]dans sa gueule une s�bile en bois pos�e devant lui sur le trottoir,
il la tendit humblement du c�t� de Tartarin immobile de
Stupeur.... Un Arabe qui passait jeta un gros sou dans la
s�bile, le lion remua la queue.... Alors Tartarin comprit
tout. Il vit, ce que l'�motion l'avait d'abord emp�ch� de voir, la
[25]foule attroup�e autour du pauvre lion aveugle et apprivois�, et
les deux grands n�gres arm�s de gourdins qui le promenaient �
travers la ville comme un Savoyard sa marmotte.

Le sang du Tarasconnais ne fit qu'un tour �Mis�rables,�
cria-t-il d'une voix de tonnerre, �ravaler ainsi ces nobles b�tes!�

[30]Et, s'�lan�ant sur le lion, il lui arracha l'immonde s�bile d'entre
ses royales m�choires.... Les deux n�gres, croyant avoir
affaire � un voleur, se pr�cipit�rent sur le Tarasconnais, la
matraque haute.... Ce fut une terrible bousculade.... Les

Page 75

n�gres tapaient, les femmes piaillaient, les enfants riaient. Un
vieux cordonnier juif criait du fond de sa boutique. �_Au zouge
de paix! Au zouge de paix!_� Le lion lui-m�me, dans sa nuit,
essaya d'un rugissement, et le malheureux Tartarin, apr�s une
[5]lutte d�sesp�r�e, roula par terre au milieu des gros sous et des
balayures.

A ce moment, un homme fendit la foule, �carta les n�gres
d'un mot, les femmes et les enfants d'un geste, releva Tartarin,
le brossa, le secoua, et l'assit tout essouffl� sur une borne.

[10]�Comment! _pr��nce_, c'est vous?...� fit le bon Tartarin
en se frottant les c�tes.

�Eh! oui, mon vaillant ami, c'est moi.... Sit�t votre lettre
re�ue, j'ai confi� Ba�a � son fr�re, lou� une chaise de poste, fait
cinquante lieues ventre � terre, et me voil� juste � temps pour
[15]vous arracher � la brutalit� de ces rustres.... Qu'est-ce que
vous avez donc fait, juste Dieu! pour vous attirer cette m�chante
affaire?

--Que voulez vous, _pr��nce_?... De voir ce malheureux
lion avec sa s�bile aux dents, humili�, vaincu, bafou�, servant de
[20]ris�e � toute cette pouillerie musulmane....

--Mais vous vous trompez, mon noble ami. Ce lion est, au
contraire, pour eux un objet de respect et d'adoration. C'est
une b�te sacr�e, qui fait partie d'un grand couvent de lions,
fond�, il y a trois cents ans, par Mahommed-ben-Aouda, une
[25]esp�ce de Trappe formidable et farouche, pleine de rugissements
et d'odeurs de fauve, o� des moines singuliers �l�vent et apprivoisent
des lions par centaines, et les envoient de l� dans toute
l'Afrique septentrionale, accompagn�s de fr�res qu�teurs....
Les dons que re�oivent les fr�res servent � l'entretien du couvent
[30]et de sa mosqu�e, et si les deux n�gres ont montr� tant d'humeur
tout � l'heure, c'est qu'ils out la conviction que pour un
sou, un seul sou de la qu�te, vol� ou perdu par leur faute, le lion
qu'ils conduisent les d�vorerait imm�diatement.�

Page 76

En �coutant ce r�cit invraisemblable et pourtant v�ridique,
Tartarin de Tarascon se d�lectait et reniflait l'air bruyamment.

�Ce qui me va dans tout ceci,� fit-il en mati�re de conclusion,
�c'est que, n'en d�plaise � mons Bombonnel, il y a encore des
[5]lions en Alg�rie!...

--S'il y en a!� dit le prince avec enthousiasme.... �D�s
demain, nous allons battre la plaine du Ch�liff, et vous verrez!....

--Eh quoi! Prince.... Auriez-vous l'intention de chasser,
vous aussi?

[10]--Parbleu! pensez-vous donc que je vous laisserais vous en
aller seul en pleine Afrique, au milieu de ces tribus f�roces dont
vous ignorez la langue et les usages.... Non! non! illustre
Tartarin, je ne vous quitte plus.... Partout o� vous serez, je
veux �tre.

[15]--Oh! _pr��nce, pr��nce_....�

Et Tartarin, radieux, pressa sur son coeur le vaillant Gr�gory,
en songeant avec fiert� qu'� l'exemple de Jules G�rard, de
Bombonnel et tous les autres fameux tueurs de lions, il allait
avoir un prince �tranger pour l'accompagner dans ses chasses.


IV


_La caravane en marche._


[20]Le lendemain, d�s la premi�re heure, l'intr�pide Tartarin
et le non moins intr�pide prince Gr�gory, suivis d'une demi-douzaine
de portefaix n�gres, sortaient de Milianah et descendaient
vers la plaine du Ch�liff par un raidillon d�licieux tout
ombrag� de jasmins, de tuyas, de caroubiers, d'oliviers sauvages,
[25]entre deux haies de petits jardins indig�nes et des milliers
de joyeuses sources vives qui d�gringolaient de roche en roche
en chantant.... Un paysage du Liban.

Aussi charg� d'armes que le grand Tartarin, le prince Gr�gory
s'�tait en plus affubl� d'un magnifique et singulier k�pi tout

Page 77

galonn� d'or, avec une garniture de feuilles de ch�ne brod�es
au fil d'argent, qui donnait � Son Altesse un faux air de g�n�ral
mexicain, ou de chef de gare des bords du Danube.

Ce diable de k�pi intriguait beaucoup le Tarasconnais, et
[5]comme il demandait timidement quelques explications:

�Coiffure indispensable pour voyager en Afrique,� r�pondit
le prince avec gravit�, et tout en faisant reluire sa visi�re d'un
revers de manche, il renseigna son na�f compagnon sur le r�le
important que joue le k�pi dans nos relations avec les Arabes,
[10]la terreur que cet insigne militaire a, seul, le privil�ge de leur
inspirer, si bien que l'administration civile a �t� oblig�e de coiffer
tout son monde avec des k�pis, depuis le cantonnier jusqu'au
receveur de l'enregistrement En somme, pour gouverner
l'Alg�rie--c'est toujours le prince qui parle--pas n'est besoin
[15]d'une forte t�te, ni m�me de t�te du tout. Il suffit d'un k�pi,
d'un beau k�pi galonn�, reluisant au bout d'une trique comme
la toque de Gessler.

Ainsi causant et philosophant, la caravane allait son train.
Les portefaix--pieds nus--sautaient de roche en roche avec
[20]des cris de singes. Les caisses d'armes sonnaient. Les fusils
flambaient. Les indig�nes qui passaient s'inclinaient jusqu'�
terre devant le k�pi magique.... L� haut, sur les remparts
de Milianah, le chef du bureau arabe, qui se promenait au bon
frais avec sa dame, entendant ces bruits insolites, et voyant des
[25]armes luire entre les branches, crut � un coup de main, fit
baisser le pont-levis, battre la g�n�rale, et mit incontinent la
ville en �tat de si�ge.

Beau d�but pour la caravane!

Malheureusement, avant la fin du jour, les choses se g�t�rent.
[30]Des n�gres qui portaient les bagages, l'un fut pris d'atroces
coliques pour avoir mang� le sparadrap de la pharmacie. Un
autre tomba sur le bord de la route ivre mort d'eau-de-vie camphr�e.
Le troisi�me, celui qui portait l'album de voyage, s�duit

Page 78

par les dorures des fermoirs, et persuad� qu'il enlevait les tr�sors
de la Mecque, se sauva dans le Zaccar � toutes jambes.... Il
fallut aviser.... La caravane fit halte, et tint conseil dans
l'ombre trou�e d'un vieux figuier.

[5]Je serais d'avis, dit le prince, en essayant, mais sans succ�s,
de d�layer une tablette de pemmican dans une casserole perfectionn�e
� triple fond, je serais d'avis que, d�s ce soir, nous
renoncions aux porteurs n�gres.... Il y a pr�cis�ment un
march� arabe tout pr�s d'ici. Le mieux est de nous y arr�ter,
[10]et de faire emplette de quelques bourriquots....

--Non!... non!... pas de bourriquots!...� interrompit
vivement le grand Tartarin, que le souvenir de Noiraud
avait fait devenir tout rouge.

Et il ajouta, l'hypocrite:

[15]�Comment voulez-vous que de si petites b�tes puissent porter
tout notre attirail?�

Le prince sourit.

�C'est ce qui vous trompe, mon illustre ami. Si maigre et
si ch�tif qu'il vous paraisse, le bourriquot alg�rien a les reins
[20]solides.... Il le faut bien pour supporter tout ce qu'il supporte....
Demandez plut�t aux Arabes. Voici comment ils
expliquent notre organisation coloniale.... En haut, disent-ils,
il y a _mouci_ le gouverneur, avec une grande trique, qui tape sur
l'�tat-major; l'�tat-major, pour se venger, tape sur le soldat; le
[25]soldat tape sur le colon, le colon tape sur l'Arabe, l'Arabe tape
sur le n�gre, le n�gre tape sur le juif, le juif � son tour tape
sur le bourriquot; et le pauvre petit bourriquot, n'ayant personne
sur qui taper, tend l'�chine et porte tout. Vous voyez
bien qu'il peut porter vos caisses.

[30]--C'est �gal,� reprit Tartarin de Tarascon, �je trouve que,
pour le coup d'oeil de notre caravane, des �nes ne feraient pas
tr�s bien.... Je voudrais quelque chose de plus oriental....
Ainsi, par exemple, si nous pouvions avoir un chameau....

Page 79

--Tant que vous en voudrez,� fit l'Altesse, et l'on se mit en
route pour le march� arabe.

Le march� se tenait � quelques kilom�tres, sur les bords du
Ch�liff.... Il y avait l� cinq ou six mille Arabes en guenilles,
[5]grouillant au soleil, et trafiquant bruyamment au milieu des
jarres d'olives noires, des pots de miel, des sacs d'�pices et
des cigares en gros tas, de grands feux o� r�tissaient des
moutons entiers, ruisselant de beurre, des boucheries en plein
air, o� des n�gres tout nus, les pieds dans le sang, les bras
[10]rouges, d�pe�aient, avec de petits couteaux, des chevreaux
pendus � une perche.

Dans un coin, sous une tente rapetass�e de mille couleurs,
un greffier maure, avec un grand livre et des lunettes. Ici, un
groupe, des cris de rage: c'est un jeu de roulette, install� sur
[15]une mesure � bl�, et des Kabyles, qui s'�ventrent autour....
L�-bas, des tr�pignements, une joie, des rires: c'est un marchand
juif avec sa mule, qu'on regarde se noyer dans le Ch�liff....
Puis des scorpions, des chiens, des corbeaux, et des mouches!...
des mouches!...

[20]Par exemple, les chameaux manquaient. On finit pourtant
par en d�couvrir un, dont des M'zabites cherchaient � se d�faire.
C'�tait le vrai chameau du d�sert, le chameau classique, chauve,
l'air triste, avec sa longue t�te de b�douin et sa bosse qui, devenue
flasque par suite de trop longs je�nes, pendait m�lancoliquement
[25]sur le c�t�.

Tartarin le trouva si beau, qu'il voulut que la caravane enti�re
mont�t dessus.... Toujours la folie orientale!...

La b�te s'accroupit. On sangla les malles.

Le prince s'installa sur le cou de l'animal. Tartarin, pour plus
[30]de majest�, se fit hisser tout en haut de la bosse, entre deux
caisses; et l�, fier et bien cal�, saluant d'un geste noble tout le
march� accouru, il donna le signal du d�part.... Tonnerre!
si ceux de Tarascon avaient pu le voir!...

Page 80

Le chameau se redressa, allongea ses grandes jambes � noeuds,
et prit son vol....

O stupeur! Au bout de quelques enjamb�es, voil� Tartarin
qui se sent p�lir, et l'h�ro�que ch�chia qui reprend une � une ses
[5]anciennes positions du temps du _Zouave_. Ce diable de chameau
tanguait comme une fr�gate.

�_Pr��nce, pr��nce_,� murmura Tartarin tout bl�me, et s'accrochant
� l'�toupe s�che de la bosse, �_pr��nce_, descendons....
Je sens ... je sens ... que je vais faire bafouer la France....�

[10]Va te promener! le chameau �tait lanc�, et rien ne pouvait
plus l'arr�ter. Quatre mille Arabes couraient derri�re, pieds
nus, gesticulant, riant comme des fous, et faisant luire au soleil
six cent mille dents blanches....

Le grand homme de Tarascon dut se r�signer. Il s'affaissa
[15]tristement sur la bosse. La ch�chia prit toutes les positions
qu'elle voulut ... et la France fut bafou�e.


V


_L'aff�t du soir dans un bois de lauriers-roses._


Si pittoresque que f�t leur nouvelle monture, nos tueurs de
lions durent y renoncer, par �gard pour la ch�chia. On continua
donc la route � pied comme devant, et la caravane s'en alla
[20]tranquillement vers le Sud par petites �tapes, le Tarasconnais
en t�te, le Mont�n�grin en queue, et dans les rangs le chameau
avec les caisses d'armes.

L'exp�dition dura pr�s d'un mois.

Pendant un mois, cherchant des lions introuvables, le terrible
[25]Tartarin erra de douar en douar dans l'immense plaine du
Ch�liff, � travers cette formidable et cocasse Alg�rie fran�aise,
o� les parfums du vieil Orient se compliquent d'une forte odeur
d'absinthe et de caserne, Abraham et Zouzou m�l�s, quelque
chose de f�erique et de na�vement burlesque, comme une page

Page 81

de l'Ancien Testament racont�e par le sergent La Ram�e ou
le brigadier Pitou.... Curieux spectacle pour des yeux qui
auraient su voir.... Un peuple sauvage et pourri que nous
civilisons, en lui donnant nos vices.... L'autorit� f�roce et
[5]sans contr�le de bachagas fantastiques, qui se mouchent gravement
dans leurs grands cordons de la L�gion d'honneur, et
pour un oui ou pour un non font b�tonner les gens sur la
plante des pieds. La justice sans conscience de cadis � grosses
lunettes, tartufes du Coran et de la loi, qui r�vent de quinze
[10]ao�t et de promotion sous les palmes, et vendent leurs arr�ts,
comme �sau son droit d'a�nesse, pour un plat de lentilles ou de
kousskouss au sucre. Des ca�ds libertins et ivrognes, anciens
brosseurs d'un g�n�ral Yusuf quelconque, qui se so�lent de
champagne avec des blanchisseuses mahonnaises, et font des
[15]ripailles de mouton r�ti, pendant que, devant leurs tentes, toute
la tribu cr�ve de faim, et dispute aux l�vriers les rogatons de la
ribote seigneuriale.

Puis, tout autour, des plaines en friche, de l'herbe br�l�e,
des buissons chauves, des maquis de cactus et de lentisques, le
[20]grenier de la France!... Grenier vide de grains, h�las! et
riche seulement en chacals et en punaises. Des douars abandonn�s,
des tribus effar�es qui s'en vont sans savoir o�, fuyant
la faim, et semant des cadavres le long de la route. De loin en
loin, un village fran�ais, avec des maisons en ruine, des champs
[25]sans culture, des sauterelles enrag�es, qui mangent jusqu'aux
rideaux des fen�tres, et tous les colons dans les caf�s, en train
de boire de l'absinthe en discutant des projets de r�forme et de
constitution.

Voil� ce que Tartarin aurait pu voir, s'il s'en �tait donn� la
[30]peine, mais, tout entier � sa passion l�onine, l'homme de Tarascon
allait droit devant lui, sans regarder ni � droite ni �
gauche, I'oeil obstin�ment fix� sur ces monstres imaginaires,
qui ne paraissaient jamais.

Page 82

Comme la tente-abri s'ent�tait � ne pas s'ouvrir et les tablettes
de pemmican � ne pas fondre, la caravane �tait oblig�e de s'arr�ter
matin et soir dans les tribus. Partout, gr�ce au k�pi du
prince Gr�gory, nos chasseurs �taient re�us � bras ouverts. Ils
[5]logeaient chez les agas, dans des palais bizarres, grandes fermes
blanches sans fen�tres, o� l'on trouve p�le-m�le des narghil�s
et des commodes en acajou, des tapis de Smyrne et des
lampes-mod�rateur, des coffres de c�dre pleins de sequins turcs, et
des pendules � sujets, style Louis-Philippe.... Partout on donnait
[10]� Tartarin des f�tes splendides, des _diffas,_ des _fantasias_....
En son honneur, des goums entiers faisaient parler la poudre et
luire leurs burnous au soleil. Puis, quand la poudre avait parl�,
le bon aga venait et pr�sentait sa note.... C'est ce qu'on
appelle l'hospitalit� arabe.

[15]Et toujours pas de lions. Pas plus de lions que sur le Pont-Neuf!

Cependant le Tarasconnais ne se d�courageait pas. S'enfon�ant bravement
dans le Sud, il passait ses journ�es � battre
le maquis, fouillant les palmiers-nains du bout de sa carabine,
[20]et faisant �frrt! frrt!� � chaque buisson. Puis, tous les soirs
avant de se coucher, un petit aff�t de deux ou trois heures....

Peine perdue! le lion ne se montrait pas.

Un soir pourtant, vers les six heures, comme la caravane traversait
un bois de lentisques tout violet o� de grosses cailles
[25]alourdies par la chaleur sautaient �a et l� dans l'herbe, Tartarin
de Tarascon crut entendre--mais si loin, mais si vague, mais
si �miett� par la brise--ce merveilleux rugissement qu'il avait
entendu tant de fois l�-has � Tarascon, derri�re la baraque
Mitaine.

[30]D'abord le h�ros croyait r�ver.... Mais au bout d'un instant,
lointains toujours, quoique plus distincts, les rugissements
recommenc�rent; et cette fois, tandis qu'� tous les coins de
l'horizon on entendait hurler les chiens des douars,--secou�e

Page 83

par la terreur et faisant retentir les conserves et les caisses
d'armes, la bosse du chameau frissonna.

Plus de doute. C'�tait le lion.... Vite, vite, � l'aff�t. Pas
une minute � perdre.

[5]Il y avait tout juste pr�s de l� un vieux _marabout_ (tombeau
de saint) � coupole blanche, avec les grandes pantoufles jaunes
du d�funt d�pos�es dans une niche au-dessus de la porte, et
un fouillis d'ex-voto bizarres, pans de burnous, fils d'or, cheveux
roux, qui pendaient le long des murailles.... Tartarin
[10]de Tarascon y remisa son prince et son chameau et se mit en
qu�te d'un aff�t. Le prince Gr�gory voulait le suivre, mais le
Tarasconnais s'y refusa; il tenait � affronter le lion seul � seul.
Toutefois il recommanda � Son Altesse de ne pas s'�loigner, et,
par mesure de pr�caution, il lui confia son portefeuille, un gros
[15]portefeuille plein de papiers pr�cieux et de billets de banque,
qu'il craignait de faire �cornifler par la griffe du lion. Ceci fait,
le h�ros chercha son poste.

Cent pas en avant du marabout, un petit bois de lauriers-ros�s
tremblait dans la gaze du cr�puscule, au bord d'une rivi�re
[20]presque � sec. C'est l� que Tartarin vint s'embusquer, le genou
en terre, selon la formule, la carabine au poing et son grand
couteau de chasse plant� fi�rement devant lui dans le sable de
la berge.

La nuit arriva. Le rose de la nature passa au violet, puis
[25]au bleu sombre.... En bas, dans les cailloux de la rivi�re,
luisait comme un miroir � main une petite flaque d'eau claire.
C'�tait l'abreuvoir des fauves. Sur la pente de l'autre berge,
on voyait vaguement le sentier blanc que leurs grosses pattes
avaient trac� dans les lentisques. Cette pente myst�rieuse
[30]donnait le frisson. Joignez � cela le fourmillement vague des
nuits africaines, branches fr�l�es, pas de velours d'animaux
r�deurs, aboiements gr�les des chacals, et l�-haut, dans le ciel,
� cent, deux cents m�tres, de grands troupeaux de grues qui

Page 84

passent avec des cris d'enfants qu'on �gorge; vous avouerez
qu'il y avait de quoi �tre �mu.

Tartarin l'�tait. Il l'�tait m�me beaucoup. Les dents lui claquaient,
le pauvre homme! Et sur la garde de son couteau de
[5]chasse plant� en terre le canon de son fusil ray� sonnait comme
une paire de castagnettes.... Qu'est-ce que vous voulez! Il
y a des soirs o� l'on n'est pas en train, et puis o� serait le
m�rite, si les h�ros n'avaient jamais peur....

Eh bien! oui, Tartarin eut peur, et tout le temps encore.
[10]N�anmoins, il tint bon une heure, deux heures, mais l'h�ro�sme
a ses limites.... Pr�s de lui, dans le lit dess�ch� de la
rivi�re, le Tarasconnais entend tout � coup un bruit de pas, des
cailloux qui roulent. Cette fois la terreur l'enl�ve de terre. Il
tire ses deux coups au hasard dans la nuit, et se replie � toutes
[15]jambes sur le marabout, laissant son coutelas debout dans le
sable comme une croix comm�morative de la plus formidable
panique qui ait jamais assailli l'�me d'un dompteur d'hydres.

�A moi, pr��nce ... le lion! ...�

Un silence.

[20]�Pr��nce, pr��nce, �tes-vous l�?�

Le prince n'�tait pas l�. Sur le mur blanc du marabout, le
bon chameau projetait seul au clair de lune l'ombre bizarre de
sa bosse.... Le prince Gr�gory venait de filer en emportant
portefeuille et billets de banque.... Il y avait un mois
[25]que Son Altesse attendait cette occasion....


VI


_Enfin!..._


Page 85

Le lendemain de cette aventureuse et tragique soir�e,
lorsqu'au petit jour notre h�ros se r�veilla, et qu'il eut acquis
la certitude que le prince et le magot �taient r�ellement partis,
partis sans retour, lorsqu'il se vit seul dans cette petite tombe
[5]blanche, trahi, vol�, abandonn� en pleine Alg�rie sauvage avec
un chameau � bosse simple et quelque monnaie de poche pour
toute ressource, alors, pour la premi�re fois, le Tarasconnais
douta. Il douta du Mont�n�gro, il douta de l'amiti�, il douta
de la gloire, il douta m�me des lions, et, comme le Christ �
[10]Geths�mani, le grand homme se prit � pleurer am�rement.

Or, tandis qu'il �tait l� pensivement assis sur la porte du
marabout, sa t�te dans ses deux mains, sa carabine entre ses
jambes, et le chameau qui le regardait, soudain le maquis d'en
face s'�carte et Tartarin stup�fait voit para�tre, � dix pas devant
[15]lui, un lion gigantesque s'avan�ant la t�te haute et poussant des
rugissements formidables qui font trembler les murs du marabout
tout charg�s d'oripeaux et jusqu'aux pantoufles du saint
dans leur niche.

Seul, le Tarasconnais ne trembla pas.

[20]�Enfin!� cria-t-il en bondissant, la crosse � l'�paule....
Pan!... pan! pfft! pfft! C'�tait fait.... Le lion avait deux
balles explosibles dans la t�te.... Pendant une minute, sur le
fond embras� du ciel africain, ce fut un feu d'artifice �pouvantable
de cervelle en �clats, de sang fumant et de toison rousse
[25]�parpill�e. Puis tout retomba et Tartarin aper�ut ... deux
grands n�gres furieux qui couraient sur lui, la matraque en l'air.
Les deux n�gres de Milianah!

O mis�re! c'�tait le lion apprivois�, le pauvre aveugle du
couvent de Mohammed que les balles tarasconnaises venaient
[30]d'abattre.

Page 86

Cette fois, par Mahom! Tartarin l'�chappa belle. Ivres de
fureur fanatique, les deux n�gres qu�teurs l'auraient s�rement
mis en pi�ces, si le Dieu des chr�tiens n'avait envoy� � son aide
[5]un ange lib�rateur, le garde champ�tre de la commune d'Orl�ansville
arrivant, son sabre sous le bras, par un petit sentier.

La vue du k�pi municipal calma subitement la col�re des
n�gres. Paisible et majestueux, l'homme � la plaque dressa proc�s-verbal
de l'affaire, fit charger sur le chameau ce qui restait du
lion, ordonna aux plaignants comme au d�linquant de le suivre,
[10]et se dirigea sur Orl�ansville, o� le tout fut d�pos� au greffe.

Ce fut une longue et terrible proc�dure!

Apr�s l'Alg�rie des tribus, qu'il venait de parcourir, Tartarin
de Tarascon connut alors une autre Alg�rie non moins cocasse
et formidable, l'Alg�rie des villes, processive et avocassi�re. Il
[15]connut la judiciaire louche qui se tripote au fond des caf�s, la
boh�me des gens de loi, les dossiers qui sentent l'absinthe, les
cravates blanches mouchet�es de _champoreau_; il connut les
huissiers, les agr��s, les agents d'affaires, toutes ces sauterelles
du papier timbr� affam�es et maigres qui mangent le colon
[20]jusqu'aux tiges de ses bottes et le laissent d�chiquet� feuille
par feuille comme un plant de ma�s....

Avant tout il s'agissait de savoir si le lion avait �t� tu� sur
le territoire civil ou le territoire militaire. Dans le premier cas
l'affaire regardait le tribunal de commerce; dans le second,
[25]Tartarin relevait du conseil de guerre, et, � ce mot de conseil
de guerre, l'impressionnable Tarasconnais se voyait d�j� fusill�
au pied des remparts, ou croupissant dans le fond d'un silo....

Le terrible, c'est que la d�limitation des deux territoires est
tr�s vague en Alg�rie.... Enfin, apr�s un mois de courses,
[30]d'intrigues, de stations au soleil dans les cours des bureaux
arabes, il fut �tabli que si d'une part le lion avait �t� tu� sur
le territoire militaire, d'autre part, Tartarin, lorsqu'il tira, se
trouvait sur le territoire civil. L'affaire se jugea donc au civil,

Page 87

et notre h�ros en fut quitte pour _deux mille cinq cents francs_
d'indemnit�, sans les frais.

Comment faire pour payer tout cela? Les quelques piastres
�chapp�es � la razzia du prince s'en �taient all�es depuis longtemps
[5]en papiers l�gaux et en absinthes judiciaires.

Le malheureux tueur de lions fut donc r�duit � vendre la
caisse d'armes au d�tail, carabine par carabine. Il vendit les
poignards, les kriss malais, les casse-t�te.... Un �picier acheta
les conserves alimentaires. Un pharmacien, ce qui restait du
[10]sparadrap. Les grandes bottes elles-m�mes y pass�rent et
suivirent la tente-abri perfectionn�e chez un marchand de
bric-�-brac, qui les �leva � la hauteur de curiosit�s cochinchinoises....
Une fois tout pay�, il ne restait plus � Tartarin
que la peau du lion et le chameau. La peau, il l'emballa
[15]soigneusement et la dirigea sur Tarascon, � l'adresse du brave
commandant Bravida. (Nous verrons tout � l'heure ce qu'il
advint de cette fabuleuse d�pouille.) Quant au chameau, il
comptait s'en servir pour regagner Alger, non pas en montant
dessus, mais en le vendant pour payer la diligence, ce qui
[20]est encore la meilleure fa�on de voyager � chameau. Malheureusement
la b�te �tait d'un placement difficile, et personne
n'en offrit un liard.

Tartarin cependant voulait regagner Alger � toute force. Il
avait h�te de revoir le corselet bleu de Ba�a, sa maisonnette, ses
[25]fontaines, et de se reposer sur les tr�fles blancs de son petit
clo�tre, en attendant de l'argent de France. Aussi notre h�ros
n'h�sita pas: et navr�, mais point abattu, il entreprit de faire
la route � pied, sans argent, par petites journ�es.

En cette occurrence, le chameau ne l'abandonna pas. Cet
[30]�trange animal s'�tait pris pour son ma�tre d'une tendresse
inexplicable, et, le voyant sortir d'Orl�ansville, se mit � marcher
religieusement derri�re lui, r�glant son pas sur le sien et ne le
quittant pas d'une semelle.

Page 88

Au premier moment, Tartarin trouva cela touchant, cette
fid�lit�, ce d�vouement � toute �preuve lui allaient au coeur,
d'autant que la b�te �tait commode et se nourrissait avec rien.
Pourtant, au bout de quelques jours, le Tarasconnais s'ennuya
[5]d'avoir perp�tuellement sur les talons ce compagnon m�lancolique,
qui lui rappelait toutes ses m�saventures, puis, l'aigreur
s'en m�lant, il lui en voulut de son air triste, de sa bosse, de son
allure d'oie brid�e. Pour tout dire, il le prit en grippe et ne
songea plus qu'� s'en d�barrasser, mais l'animal tenait bon....
[10]Tartarin essaya de le perdre, le chameau le retrouva; il essaya
de courir, le chameau courut plus vite.... Il lui criait: �Va
t'en!� en lui jetant des pierres. Le chameau s'arr�tait et le regardait
d'un air triste, puis, au bout d'un moment, il se remettait
en route et finissait toujours par le rattraper. Tartarin dut se
[15]r�signer.

Pourtant, lorsque apr�s huit grands jours de marche, le Tarasconnais
poudreux, harass�, vit de loin �tinceler dans la verdure
les premi�res terrasses blanches d'Alger, lorsqu'il se trouva
aux portes de la ville, sur l'avenue bruyante de Mustapha, an
[20]milieu des zouaves, des biskris, des Mahonnaises, tous grouillant
autour de lui et le regardant d�filer avec son chameau, pour le
coup la patience lui �chappa. �Non! non!� dit-il, �ce n'est
pas possible.... je ne peux pas entrer dans Alger avec un
animal pareil!� et, profitant d'un encombrement de voitures, il
[25]fit un crochet dans les champs et se jeta dans un foss�!

Au bout d'un moment, il vit au-dessus de sa t�te, sur la
chauss�e de la route, le chameau qui filait � grandes enjamb�es,
allongeant le cou d'un air anxieux.

Alors, soulag� d'un grand poids, le h�ros sortit de sa cachette,
[30]et rentra dans la ville par un sentier d�tourn� qui longeait le
mur de son petit clos.


VII


_Catastrophes sur catastrophes._


Page 89

En arrivant devant sa maison mauresque, Tartarin s'arr�ta
tr�s �tonn�. Le jour tombait, la rue �tait d�serte. Par la porte
basse en ogive que la n�gresse avait oublie de fermer, on entendait
des rires, des bruits de verres, des d�tonations de bouchons
[5]de Champagne, et dominant tout ce joli vacarme une voix de
femme qui chantait, joyeuse et claire:

Aimes-tu, Marco la Belle,
La danse aux salons en fleurs....

�Tron de Diou!� fit le Tarasconnais en p�lissant, et il se
[10]pr�cipita dans la cour.

Malheureux Tartarin! Quel spectacle l'attendait.... Sous
les arceaux du petit clo�tre, au milieu des flacons, des p�tisseries,
des coussins �pars, des pipes, des tambourins, des guitares,
Ba�a debout, sans veston bleu ni corselet, rien qu'une chemisette
[15]de gaze argent�e et un grand pantalon rose tendre, chantait
_Marco la Belle_ avec une casquette d'officier de marine sur
l'oreille.... A ses pieds, sur une natte, gav� d'amour et de
confitures, Barbassou, l'inf�me capitaine Barbassou, se crevait
de rire en l'�coutant.

[20]L'apparition de Tartarin, h�ve, maigri, poudreux, les yeux
flamboyants, la ch�chia h�riss�e, interrompit tout net cette aimable
orgie turco-marseillaise. Ba�a poussa un petit cri de
levrette effray�e, et se sauva dans la maison. Barbassou, lui,
ne se troubla pas, et riant de plus belle:

[25]�H�! b�! monsieur Tartarin, qu'est-ce que vous en dites?
Vous voyez bien qu'elle savait le fran�ais!�

Tartarin de Tarascon s'avan�a furieux.

�Capitaine!

--_Digo-li qu� vengu�, moun bon!_� cria la Mauresque, se
[30]penchant de la galerie du premier avec un joli geste canaille.

Page 90

Le pauvre homme, atterr�, se laissa choir sur un tambour. Sa
Mauresque savait m�me le marseillais!

�Quand je vous disais de vous m�fier des Alg�riennes!� fit
sentencieusement le capitaine Barbassou. �C'est comme votre
[5]prince mont�n�grin.�

Tartarin releva la t�te.

�Vous savez ou est le prince?

--Oh! il n'est pas loin. Il habite pour cinq ans la belle prison
de Mustapha. Le dr�le s'est laiss� prendre la main dans le
[10]sac.... Du reste, ce n'est pas la premi�re fois qu'on le met
� l'ombre. Son Altesse a d�j� fait trois ans de maison centrale
quelque part ... et, tenez! je crois m�me que c'est � Tarascon.

--A Tarascon!...� s'�cria Tartarin subitement illumin�....
�C'est donc �a qu'il ne connaissait qu'un c�t� de la ville....

[15]--H�! sans doute ... Tarascon, vu de la maison centrale....
Ah! mon pauvre monsieur Tartarin, il faut joliment ouvrir l'oeil
dans ce diable de pays, sans quoi on est expos� � des choses
bien d�sagr�ables.... Ainsi votre histoire avec le muezzin....

--Quelle histoire? quel muezzin?

[20]--T�! pardi!... le muezzin d'en face qui faisait la cour
� Ba�a.... L'_Akbar_ a racont� l'affaire l'autre jour, et tout
Alger en rit encore.... C'est si dr�le ce muezzin qui, du haut
de sa tour, tout en chantant ses pri�res, faisait sous votre nez
des d�clarations � la petite, et lui donnait des rendez-vous en
[25]invoquant le nom d'Allah....

--Mais c'est donc tous des gredins dans ce pays?...�
hurla le malheureux Tarasconnais.

Barbassou eut un geste de philosophe.

�Mon cher, vous savez, les pays neufs.... C'est �gal! si
[30]vous m'en croyez, vous retournerez bien vite � Tarascon.

--Retourner ... c'est facile � dire.... Et l'argent?...
Vous ne savez donc pas comme ils m'ont plum�, l�-has, dans le
d�sert?

Page 91

--Qu'� cela ne tienne!� fit le capitaine en riant.... �Le
_Zouave_ part demain, et si vous voulez, je vous rapatrie ...
�a vous va-t-il, coll�gue?... Alors, tr�s bien. Vous n'avez plus
qu'une chose � faire. Il reste encore quelques fioles de champagne,
[5]une moiti� de croustade ... asseyez-vous l�, et sans
rancune!...�

Apr�s la minute d'h�sitation que lui commandait sa dignit�,
le Tarasconnais prit bravement son parti. Il s'assit, on trinqua;
Ba�a, redescendue au bruit des verres, chanta la fin de _Marco
[10]la Belle_, et la f�te se prolongea fort avant dans la nuit.

Vers trois heures du matin, la t�te l�g�re et le pied lourd, le
bon Tartarin revenait d'accompagner son ami le capitaine, lorsqu'en
passant devant la mosqu�e, le souvenir du muezzin et
de ses farces le fit rire, et tout de suite une belle id�e de vengeance
[15]lui traversa le cerveau. La porte �tait ouverte. Il entra,
suivit de longs couloirs tapiss�s de nattes, monta, monta encore,
et finit par se trouver dans un petit oratoire turc, o� une lanterne
en fer d�coup� se balan�ait au plafond, brodant les murs blancs
d'ombres bizarres.

[20]Le muezzin �tait l�, assis sur un divan, avec son gros turban,
sa pelisse blanche, sa pipe de Mostaganem, et devant un grand
verre d'absinthe fra�che, qu'il battait religieusement, en attendant
l'heure d'appeler les croyants � la pri�re.... A la vue
de Tartarin, il l�cha sa pipe de terreur.

[25]�Pas un mot, cur�,� fit le Tarasconnais, qui avait son
id�e.... �Vite, ton turban, ta pelisse!...�

Le cur� turc, tout tremblant, donna son turban, sa pelisse,
tout ce qu'on voulut. Tartarin s'en affubla, et passa gravement
sur la terrasse du minaret.

[30]La mer luisait au loin. Les toits blancs �tincelaient au clair de
lune. On entendait dans la brise marine quelques guitares attard�es....
Le muezzin de Tarascon se recueillit un moment, puis,
levant les bras, il commen�a � psalmodier d'une voix suraigu�:

Page 92

�_La Allah il Allah_.... Mahomet est un vieux farceur.,..
L'Orient, le Coran, les bachagas, les lions, les Mauresques, tout
�a ne vaut pas un vi�daze!... Il n'y a plus de _Teurs_....
Il n'y a que des carotteurs.... Vive Tarascon!...�

[5]Et pendant qu'en un jargon bizarre, m�l� d'arabe et de proven�al,
l'illustre Tartarin jetait aux quatre coins de l'horizon, sur
la ville, sur la plaine, sur la montagne, sa joyeuse mal�diction
tarasconnaise, la voix claire et grave des autres muezzins lui
r�pondait, en s'�loignant de minaret en minaret, et les derniers
[10]croyants de la ville haute se frappaient d�votement la poitrine.

_Tarascon! Tarascon!_


Midi. Le _Zouave_ chauffe, on va partir. L�-haut, sur le balcon
du caf� Valentin, MM. les officiers braquent la longue-vue, et
viennent, colonel en t�te, par rang de grade, regarder l'heureux
petit bateau qui va en France. C'est la grande distraction de
[15]l'�tat-major.... En has, la rade �tincelle. La culasse des
vieux canons turcs enterr�s le long du quai flambe au soleil.
Les passagers se pressent. Biskris et Mahonnais entassent
les bagages dans les barques.

Tartarin de Tarascon, lui, n'a pas de bagages. Le voici qui
[20]descend de la rue de la Marine, par le petit march�, plein de
bananes et de past�ques, accompagn� de son ami Barbassou.
Le malheureux Tarasconnais a laiss� sur la rive du Maure sa
caisse d'armes et ses illusions, et maintenant il s'appr�te �
voguer vers Tarascon, les mains dans ses poches.... A peine
[25]vient-il de sauter dans la chaloupe du capitaine, qu'une b�te
essouffl�e d�gringole du haut de la place, et se pr�cipite vers
lui, en galopant. C'est le chameau, le chameau fid�le, qui, depuis
vingt-quatre heures, cherche son ma�tre dans Alger.

Page 93

Tartarin, en le voyant, change de couleur et feint de ne pas
le conna�tre; mais le chameau s'acharne. Il fr�tille au long du
quai. Il appelle son ami, et le regarde avec tendresse:
�Emm�ne-moi,� semble dire son oeil triste, �emm�ne-moi dans la barque,
[5]loin, bien loin de cette Arabie en carton peint, de cet Orient
ridicule, plein de locomotives et de diligences, o�--dromadaire
d�class�--je ne sais plus que devenir. Tu es le dernier Turc,
je suis le dernier chameau.... Ne nous quittons plus, � mon
Tartarin....

[10]--Est-ce que ce chameau est � vous?� demande le capitaine.

�Pas du tout!� r�pond Tartarin, qui fr�mit � l'id�e d'entrer
dans Tarascon avec cette escorte ridicule; et, reniant impudemment
le compagnon de ses infortunes, il repousse du pied le sol
alg�rien, et donne � la barque l'�lan du d�part.... Le chameau flaire
[15]l'eau, allonge le cou, fait craquer ses jointures et, s'�lan�ant
derri�re la barque � corps perdu, il nage de conserve vers le
_Zouave_, avec son dos bomb�, qui flotte comme une gourde, et
son grand col, dress� sur l'eau en �peron de trir�me.

Barque et chameau viennent ensemble se ranger aux flancs
[20]du paquebot.

�A la fin, il me fait peine, ce dromadaire!� dit le capitaine
Barbassou tout �mu, �j'ai envie de le prendre � mon
bord.... En arrivant � Marseille, j'en ferai hommage an
Jardin zoologique.�

[25]On hissa sur le pont, � grand renfort de palans et de
cordes, le chameau, alourdi par l'eau de mer, et le _Zouave_ se
mit en route.

Les deux jours que dura la travers�e, Tartarin les passa tout
seul dans sa cabine, non pas que la mer f�t mauvaise, ni que
[30]la ch�chia e�t trop � souffrir, mais le diable de chameau, d�s
que son ma�tre apparaissait sur le pont, avait autour de lui des
empressements ridicules.... Vous n'avez jamais vu un chameau
afficher quelqu'un comme cela!...

Page 94

D'heure en heure, par les hublots de la cabine o� il mettait
le nez quelquefois, Tartarin vit le bleu du ciel alg�rien p�lir;
puis, enfin, un matin, dans une brume d'argent, il entendit avec
bonheur chanter toutes les cloches de Marseille. On �tait
[5]arriv� ... le _Zouave_ jeta l'ancre.

Notre homme, qui n'avait pas de bagages, descendit sans rien
dire, traversa Marseille en h�te, craignant toujours d'�tre suivi
par le chameau, et ne respira que lorsqu'il se vit install� dans
un wagon de troisi�me classe, filant bon train sur Tarascon....
[10]S�curit� trompeuse! A peine � deux lieues de Marseille, voil�
toutes les t�tes aux porti�res. On crie, on s'�tonne. Tartarin,
� son tour, regarde, et ... qu'aper�oit-il?... Le chameau,
monsieur, l'in�vitable chameau, qui d�talait sur les rails, en
pleine Crau, derri�re le train, et lui tenant pied. Tartarin,
[15]constern�, se rencoigna, en fermant les yeux.

Apr�s cette exp�dition d�sastreuse, il avait compt� rentrer
chez lui incognito. Mais la pr�sence de ce quadrup�de encombrant
rendait la chose impossible. Quelle rentr�e il allait
faire, bon Dieu! Pas le son, pas de lions, rien. . . Un
[20]chameau!...

�Tarascon!... Tarascon!...�
Il fallut descendre....

O stupeur! � peine la ch�chia du h�ros apparut-elle dans
l'ouverture de la porti�re, un grand cri: �Vive Tartarin!� fit
[25]trembler les vo�tes vitr�es de la gare.--�Vive Tartarin! vive
le tueur de lions!� Et des fanfares, des choeurs d'orph�ons
�clat�rent.... Tartarin se sentit mourir; il croyait � une
mystification. Mais non! tout Tarascon �tait l�, chapeaux en
l'air, et sympathique. Voil� le brave commandant Bravida,
[30]l'armurier Costecalde, le pr�sident, le pharmacien, et tout le
noble corps des chasseurs de casquettes qui se presse autour de
son chef, et le porte en triomphe tout le long des escaliers....

Page 95

Singuliers effets du mirage! la peau du lion aveugle, envoy�e
� Bravida, �tait cause de tout ce bruit. Avec cette modeste
fourrure, expos�e au cercle, les Tarasconnais, et derri�re eux
tout le Midi, s'�taient mont� la t�te. Le S�maphore avait parl�.
[5]On avait invent� un drame. Ce n'�tait plus un lion que Tartarin
avait tu�, c'�taient dix lions, vingt lions, une marmelade de lions!
Aussi Tartarin, d�barquant � Marseille, y �tait d�j� illustre sans
le savoir, et un t�l�gramme enthousiaste I'avait devanc� de deux
heures dans sa ville natale.

[10]Mais ce qui mit le comble � la joie populaire, ce fut quand
on vit un animal fantastique, couvert de poussi�re et de sueur,
appara�tre derri�re le h�ros, et descendre � cloche-pied l'escalier
de la gare. Tarascon crut un instant sa Tarasque revenue.

Tartarin rassura ses compatriotes.

[15]�C'est mon chameau,� dit-il.

Et d�j� sous l'influence du soleil tarasconnais, ce beau soleil
qui fait mentir ing�nument, il ajouta, en caressant la bosse du
dromadaire:

�C'est une noble b�te!... Elle m'a vu tuer tous mes lions.�

[20]L�-dessus, il prit famili�rement le bras du commandant, rouge
de bonheur; et, suivi de son chameau, entour� des chasseurs
de casquettes, acclam� par tout le peuple, il se dirigea paisiblement
vers la maison du baobab, et, tout en marchant, il commen�a
le r�cit de ses grandes chasses:

[25]�Figurez-vous, disait-il, qu'un certain soir, en plein Sahara....�

_Page#_ Line#.



_Dedication_ _Gonzague-Privat_ (Louis de): painter, art critic and
novelist, born at Montpellier in 1843. Daudet wrote a preface for his
"Joie perdue" (1893).

_1_ 1 _Tarascon_: a very old city (population 9,000) on the east bank of
the Rhone, opposite Beaucaire (cf. note to _13_28), about fifty miles
northwest of Marseilles. To Daudet the choice of proper names was always
a matter for careful consideration. Tarascon was not the home of the
original Tartarin (see Introduction, p. xxvi), but, as Daudet explains in
"Trente Ans de Paris," p 142, "a pseudonym picked up on the road from
Paris to Marseilles because when rounded out by the southern accent it
vibrated sonorously and triumphed at the conductor's call of stations like
the war-cry of an Apache Indian." On the _Tarasque_ cf. note to _3_25.

_1_ 2 _il y a ... de cela:_ 'that was ... ago,' lit. 'there are ... from
that.'

_1_ 3 _je m'en souviens:_ 'I remember it.' _Se souvenir de quelque chose,_
hence _s'en souvenir (en_ replacing _de_ + a pronoun); cf. _changer de
chanson, en changer_ _7_ 5, _revenir de l�-bas, en revenir_ _16_ 12.

_1_ 4 _habitait:_ 'was living in.' Be careful to give the imperfect its
progressive force wherever possible.

_1_ 5 _le chemin d'Avignon:_ 'the Avignon road.' Note that an English noun
used adjectively is usually replaced in French by _de_ + noun, the student
should be careful to translate _une robe de soie_ 'a silk dress' and not
'a dress of silk'; cf. _de petits soldats de plomb_ (_71_ 4) 'little lead
soldiers,' _l'eau de mer_ (_93_26) 'the sea water', _52_25, _79_23. For
_une voix de femme_ (_89_ 5) we cannot say 'a woman voice,' but must say
'the voice of a woman,' 'woman' not being a possible noun-adjective here;
still _voix de femme_ is a noun-phrase modified by _une;_ cf. _une cour de
caravans�rail_ (_70_ 21) 'the court of a caravansary,' _un coin de
m�chante route_ (_70_ 28) 'the corner of a wretched road'--_Avignon:_ city
on the Rhone, above Tarascon; famous as the residence of the Popes from
1309 to 1377.

_1_ 6: _devant_: adverb, 'in front'; cf. _derri�re_ in this sentence,
_dessus_ _24_ 1, _46_ 12, _depuis_ _56_ 32, _autour_ _79_ 15.

_1_ 8: Savoyards: boys and men from Savoy, southeastern France, are seen
throughout the country exercising such trades as those of bootblacks,
chimney-sweeps, charcoal-venders; cf. note to _74_ 27.--Savoyards
... t�te ... leurs bo�tes: cf. note to _29_ 11.

_1_ 10: _Du dehors ... rien_: 'seen from the outside the house seemed
nothing at all,' 'was in no way remarkable'.

_1_ 12: _coquin de sort_: a characteristic Southern oath, lit. 'rascal of
(a) fate' translate 'heavens and earth!' cf. _monstre de sort_ _63_ 27,
_coquin de bon sort_ _68_ 21. For the construction cf. _coquin de li�vre_
_4_ 24, _diable d'homme_ _9_ 3. The genitive (_de_ + noun) in these
expressions replaces a noun in apposition/ Cf. Engl. "rascal of a man,"
Latin _scelus viri_; "the city New York," "the city of New York."

[Footnote _1_ 16: _du pays_. i.e. 'native' to that part of Europe; cf. _au
pays_ _64_ 27, _du cru_ _26_ 6.]

_1_ 17: _rien que_: 'nothing but'; i.e. _il n'y avait rien que_. Cf. _37_
10, and notes to _13_ 1,_4_ 23.--plantes exotiques: a few lines farther
on, our author explains that these exotic plants were, of course, not of
full natural size. The baobab in its native African home is only 40-70
feet in height, but its trunk is sometimes 30 feet in diameter. In _17_
20-21 we are given to understand that Tartarin's baobab, the most admired
of his botanical rarities, is perhaps after all nothing but a turnip, and
we are led to suspect that some of the others are not what they pretend to
be. If we are gifted with even a small portion of the imagination
possessed by Tartarin and his fellow-townsmen, we can understand how a
turnip may after a while come really to be a baobab; if we have not
sufficient imagination to admit this possibility, we shall not be able to
appreciate the story of the life and adventures of Tartarin de Tarascon.


_2_ 2: _� se croire ... Afrique_: '(enough) to (make one) believe himself
in the very heart of (cf. _5_ 7) Africa.' � = _assez pour_; cf. _c'est �
mourir de rire_, 'it's enough to make you die with laughter'; also _6_ 14,
_21_ 16.

_2_ 3: _bien entendu_: 'of course'; lit. 'well (heard) understood.'

_2_ 5: arbos gigantea: Latin, = _arbre g�ant_ 'giant tree.'--tenait �
l'aise dans: 'easily found room in.'

_2_ 6: pot de r�s�da: 'mignonette pot.' _Pot de fleurs_ = 'flower pot'
Logically we should expect, and in a dealer's catalogue we find, _pot �
fleurs_, cf. _une tasse � caf�_ 'a coffee cup,' _une tasse de caf�_ 'a cup
of coffee.' Daudet in speaking of this same mignonette pot uses _pot �
r�s�da_ in "Tartarin sur les Alpes," p. 358.--c'est �gal: 'all the same'.

_2_ 7: _d�j�_: lit. 'already'; 'anyhow,' 'nevertheless'.

_2_ 8: _s'en retournaient_: cf. _s'en aller_ _17_ 4, _s'en revenir_ _53_
11.

_2_ 10: _je dus �prouver_: 'I must have experienced.' _Devoir_ is
difficult to translate because the corresponding English auxiliaries
(_must_, _ought_) are defective. The following are the most usual
translations:
_je dois aller_ I must go, I ought to go, I should go, I have to go, I am
to go.
_je devais aller_ I had to go, I was to go (cf. _18_ 2) I should have
gone, I must have gone (cf. _16_ 26).
_je dus aller_ I had to go (cf. _67_ 7), I must have gone (cf. _40_ 4).
_je devrai aller_ I shall have to go
_je devrais aller_ I should go, I ought to go, I should have to go.
_j'ai d� aller_ I had to go, I have had to go, I must have gone
Cf. notes to _43_ 20, 29.

_2_ 11: _mirifique_: a mock-heroic synonym for _merveilleux_.--_bien
autre_: _bien_ in its common intensive use, 'quite.' _Bien_ frequently
adds to a passage a shade of meaning which can be rendered in English only
by a complete remodeling of the sentence, e.g. _je veux bien_ 'I have no
objection,' 'I consent.' When _autre_ is preceded by _bien_ or _tout_, it
usually carries the idea of superiority.

_2_ 14: _ouvrant de plain-pied sur le baobab_: 'opening on a level with
the baobab'; there was no step. _Plain_='flat.'

[Footnote _2_ 18: _carabines_: 'rifles.' _carabine_ is the French word for
"rifle", _fusil_ is the general term (gun) and is applied particularly to
the shotgun The English word "rifle" is sometimes used in French for a
rifle having a long barrel. With _carabine_ cf. English "carbine," a
short-barreled rifle. Translate here 'carbines, rifles.']

_2_ 19: _catalans_: Catalonia is in northeastern Spain.
--_couteaux-revolvers_: 'pistol dirks,' pistols with dirks set in their
butts, ordaggers with pistols in their hilts.--_couteaux-poignards_:
'dagger-knives' an ancient form of one-edged dagger, having a long and
heavy blade.--_krish_ (criss, kriss) malais: 'Malay creeses,' daggers with
sinuous edges, famous for deadliness.

_2_ 20: _fl�ches cara�bes_: 'Carib arrows.' The Caribs are the most
war-like tribe of northern South America, the home of the famous curare
poison and other arrow-poisons.--_casse-t�te_: any kind of war-club that
can be wielded by one hand; transl. 'war-clubs' (cf. _59_ 29);
indeclinable.

_2_ 21: _est-ce que je sais!_ lit. 'do I know!' transl. 'and what not.'

_2_ 23: _glaives_: 'swords.' _Glaive_ (cf. Engl. "glaive"), from Latin
_gladius_, is a poetic word for _�p�e_.


_2_ 24 _vous donner la chair de poule:_ 'make your flesh creep' With the
French _chair de poule_ 'hen flesh' cf. Engl. "goose flesh".

_2_36 _yataganerie._ the _yatagan,_ 'yataghan,' is the saber of the Turks
and the Arabs, from this word Daudet coined _yataganerie_ on the analogy
of _�picerie, papeterie,_ etc, transl. 'paraphernalia of war'.

_2_28 _bonhomme_ a noun used adjectively, transl. 'kindly'.

_2_ 29 _n'y touchez pas_ _Toucher � quelque chose,_ hence _y toucher,_ 'to
touch it,' _y_,' replacing _�_ + a pronoun, cf. _� Shang Hai_ and _y_ _16_
10, and notes to _6_ 14, _7_ 6, _9_ 7, _24_ 7.

_3_3 _Cook:_ Captain James Cook (1728-1779), famous English scientific
explorer, killed by savages in Hawaii.--_Cooper_ James Fenimore Cooper
(1789-1851), the famous American writer of Indian and sea stories

America--_Gustave Aimard_ (1818 1883) spent several years in America
and wrote many tales in the style of Cooper.

the country about Tarascon until it was slain by Saint Martha, sister of
Lazarus, who, in company with the three Marys, had come to Provence after
the death of Christ At irregular intervals there is a festival in Tarascon
to celebrate the destruction of the Tarasque. Martha is the patron saint

_4_ 24 _coquin de li�vre_: cf. note to _1_ 12--_�chappe ... aux_: note the

avoid repetition of _6_ 1, _24_ 16, _69_ 9--_hirondelles en salmis_

the friend of man; the superstition that to kill one brings bad luck is
very old and almost umversal. Despite this belief and despite the game

numbers of swallows are killed and eaten. Swallows and other small birds
are usually roasted, cut in small pi�ces, and stewed with wine (_salmis_).

_6_ 13 _Ce qui ... de romances:_ lit. 'what ... of ballads'; transl. 'the

_6_ 24 _si j'�tais-t-invisible:_ the non-etymological _t_ is inserted to

_9_ 14 _cheval de trompette:_ 'trumpeter's horse,' 'war-horse.'

_romantique_ is used in speaking of the Romantic School literary history,
and of landscapes.--_don Quichotte:_ hero of the celebrated novel "Don
Quixote," by Cervantes (1547-1616, cf. note to _39_ 24). Don Quixote, a
Spanish gentleman, has his head turned as a result of excessive reading of
romances, and, attended by his fat, vulgar squire, Sancho Panza, scours
Spain, righting wrongs and rescuing fair damsels, in the fashion of the
knights of old. Don Quixote was ever tireless and fearless, while Sancho
Panza disliked hard knocks and preferred a slothful life of ease and
plenty to the glorious career of privations which was the lot of the
knight errant. Tartarin de Tarascon combined the qualities of Don Quixote
and Sancho Panza; hence a terrible internal conflict of which we shall
read in chapter vi. This disconcerting complexity of character, which is
not confined to a Southerner if we may believe the epigraph of this work
(_En France tout le monde est un peu de Tarascon_), is again elucidated in
"La D�fense de Tarascon" (in "Contes du lundi") and in "Tartarin sur les
Alpes," ch. ii, p 35, where the adventurous spirit of warren rabbits
(_lapins de garenne_) clashes with the domesticity of cabbage-garden
rabbits (_lapins de choux_).

a mountainous district of central Italy, noted for its brigands.

Vauvert in the suburbs of Paris belonged to King Louis IX.  Some
Carthusian monks who desired to gain possession of it pretended that it
was haunted by evil spirits, and it was abandoned to them, hence the
expression _diable Vauvert_ (_Vauvert_ is a genitive, 'the demon of
Vauvert'), which was later corrupted to _diable au vert _. The castle was
far from the center of the city, perhaps it is for this reason that _aller
au diable vauvert, au diable au vert_, means 'to go a long distance'. I
have not seen an article on this locution which appeared in the _Revue du
Midi_, 1911.--_comment diantre:_ 'how the deuce', diantre is a euphemism

_14_ 5 _Je sens deux hommes en moi_: see Romans vii, Galatians v, 17.  One
of the distinctive features of the religion of St Paul was its insistence
upon an internal conflict between the higher and lower impulses of man.

Racine's canticles (III) where the words _Je trouve deux hommes en moi_
appear.

_14_ 6 _P�re d'�glise_ 'Church Father' Paul was an Apostle, not a Church
Father. The Church Fathers were the early disseminators and expounders of

Shakespearean "Knock _me_ that door!" and "There's perfection _for you_!'

than in English, cf._30_ 17, _49_ 25 Note the play on the words _haut,
Hauteur_ _14_ 5 _n'entendait_ ... oreille-l� i.e. "didn't see it in that
light".

_16_ 7 _Parions que si, parions que non_ 'I'll bet (lit 'let us bet') he

_17_ 4 allez-vous-en dans le Midi 'go (away) into the South' The force
of _s'en_ in _s'en aller_ is sometimes vague, and in colloquial speech
_s'en aller_ often is almost equivalent to the simple aller, e g _je m'en
vais vous dire_ 'I am going to tell you', cf._55_ 10, _63_ 22, _2_ 8, _53_
11.

of a person Tartarin was demonstrating to some 'lovers (of arms)'.

(_19_ 14) in the north, the Mzabites, purest Berbers of all, in the south,
and the marauding Tuaregs (_11_ 6) in the Sahara. The Mzabites, the
heretical Puritans of Algerian Mohammedanism, are seen everywhere as
honest petty traders and workers in street industries. The Arab conquest
about 700 A.D. made Arabic the dominant language of all North Africa to
this day--an important fact to remember--and introduced the Arabs as a
permanent population along the north edge of the Sahara. The conquest by
Turkish pirates about 1500 A.D., with subordination to the Sultan of
Turkey till 1669, brought in very few Turks; the pirates were a mixture of
various Mohammedan nations with renegades from the Christian nations. The
"Moors" of to-day in Algeria are their descendants; the ancient Moors were
Berbers. During the centuries of pirate rule, and earlier, negroes were
brought in as slaves; Mohammedan custom favored setting them free in a few
years if they became Mohammedans. The overthrow of the pirates by the
French in 1830, and the French conquest during the next thirty years,
caused most of the few Turks to leave the country, and started an influx
of Europeans from the Mediterranean countries; Daudet notices especially
the Minorcans (_Mahonnais_ from the city of Port Mahon).

_40 22 _charabia:_ borrowed from the Spanish _algarab�a_, which means

_40_ 28 _du latin de Pourceaugnac:_ 'Pourceaugnac Latin,' meaningless
Latin such as that which Moli�re introduces into some of his plays.
"Monsieur de Pourceaugnac" is the name of one of Moli�re's farces, and
there is some Latin in it; but Daudet probably had in mind "Le M�decin
malgr� lui," II, 6. He uses the name _Pourceaugnac_ here because he likes
the sound. _Rosa, rosae,_ is the type-noun of the first declension in
French grammars of to-day, where we have ordinarily _mensa_ or _stella_.
In Moli�re's time, as suggested by the passage of "Le M�decin malgr� lui"
referred to, _musa, musae_, was the noun commonly used.

_41_ 15 _la ligne:_ in the French and English armies the term la _ligne_,

short but disastrous war, Montenegro had been forced to sign a humiliating
treaty of peace in which she virtually acknowledged the suzerainty of

which "Tartarin" grew. It is possible that he met there the prototype of
Gregory brooding over the disgrace of his country, or, at least,

"a free Montenegro" means a Montenegro free from the existing

_85_ 9 _le Christ:_ pronounced [krist]; always with the article (the
Anointed).

_85_ 10 _Geths�mani:_ in the words _douta, pleurer_, Daudet refers to
Christ's moral and physical recoil at Gethsemane. A Frenchman is not
offended as we are by the flippancy of this reference to one of the
supreme moments of Christ's life. Cf. De Vigny's "Le Mont des Oliviers."

_85_ 13 _d'en face:_ 'in front of him'; cf. _90_ 20.

_85_ 17 _jusqu'aux pantoufles:_ made 'even the slippers' shake; of _81_

judicial system which is cooked up', cf. note to _5_ 23.

supposed to have come from Bohemia; consequently any persons who lead an
irregular life are called Bohemians. Thus, for example, the Latin Quarter
of Paris, inhabited largely by artists and students, is called the
"Bohemian Quarter."

_86_ 18 _sauterelles:_ cf. note to _24_ 23.

_86_ 19 _papier timbr�:_ 'stamped paper.' A government revenue stamp,
either printed on the paper (_papier timbr�_) or affixed, must accompany
French legal and commercial documents. _Timbre-poste_, masculine, =
'postage stamp.'

_86_ 20 _tiges de ses bottes:_ the locusts, _sauterelles_ (_1_ 18), eat a
Plant jusqu'� la tige; Daudet is punning here on the two meanings of
_tige,_ 'stalk' of a plant, 'leg' of a boot.--_d�chiquet� ... ma�s:_
'stripped like a stalk of corn,' of whose foliage the locusts leave
nothing but midribs and hanging fibers.

_86_ 27 _silo:_ a pit for storing grain. Since Goffart's work on the
ensilage of green crops, published in 1877, the word has become familiar

there while filth accumulated around them.

'especially because.'--_rien:_ 'nothing '; cf. note to _13_ 1. _Il ne se

anything,' the introduction of _ne_ bringing the negation to bear upon the
verb.

_88_ 8 _oie brid�e:_ 'bridled goose' and figuratively 'ninny.' A feather
is sometimes passed through the nostrils of a goose or a gosling (_oison

appearance which the fowl presents gives use to the figurative meaning.
Cf. Rabelais's judge _Bridoie_ and Beaumarchais's _Brid'oison._
--le prit en grippe:_ 'took a dislike to him'; _grippe_ formerly meant
'whim,' 'fancy.'

Marseilles.

_91_ 16 _monta encore:_ 'ascended still higher.'

_91_ 21 _Mostaganem:_ a city on the Mediterranean, west of Algiers.

_91_ 25 _cur�:_ it is amusing to hear Tartarin apply the title of the
respected French parish priest to the rascally muezzin. At home Tartarin
would address the priest as _monsieur le cur�._

_92_ 1 _La Allah il Allah:_ French transliteration of the Arabic words
with which the Mohammedan confession of faith, 'There is no god but God,
and Mohammed is God's messenger,' begins. Both parts of this confession of
faith, especially the first part, are repeated more than once in the
muezzin's regular call. The first part is misquoted in various forms, as
here, by Europeans who have been confused by the series of sounds. Note
that Tartarin not only echoes the sound of this part, but parodies its
sense in lines 3-4--_farceur:_ 'fraud.'

_92_ 3 _vi�daze:_ a Proven�al word, used of persons, = 'a good for
nothing,' of things, = 'a trifle.' Here 'isn't worth a straw.'

_92_ 9 _derniers:_  believers are few even in the upper part of the city
(cf. note to _37_ 27).

_92_ 15 _La culasse:_ we should use the plural in English. Note this
peculiarity of French style, cf. _la face des soldats �tait couverte de
sueur_ 'the soldiers' faces were covered with sweat.' Cf. note to _29_ 11,
and _92_ 12.

_92_ 16 canons turcs: cf. note to _40_ 17. These old cannon are set in
the pavement of the quay as posts for the mooring of ships and for
similar uses.

_92_ 24 _A peine vient-il de sauter ... qu':_ 'scarcely has he leaped
when.' _A peine_ reenforces _vient de_. For the inversion cf. note to _5_
32.

_93_ 5 _en carton peint:_ 'of painted pasteboard,' i.e. counterfeit.

_93_ 6 _dromadaire:_ the word is here used correctly according to the
Academy's dictionary, which makes _dromadaire_ a name of the one humped
species of camel. According to more exact usage a dromedary is a high bred
camel for special speed, usually of the one humped species but not
necessarily so, in this sense Tartarin's beast can hardly claim the name.

_93_ 7 _que devenir:_ lit. 'what to become', transl. 'what to do with

desperately.

_93_ 16 _de conserve:_ 'in consort' (with the captain's row boat).
_Conserve_ in the sense of 'the action of preserving' survives only in
this nautical expression, _naviguer de conserve._--'to sail in consort'
(used of ships which sail together so as to help one another).

_93_ 18 _col:_ = _cou_, used in this sense only in certain fixed
expressions, ordinarily = 'collar.'--_en �peron de trir�me:_ 'like (cf.
note to _5_ 20) the beak of a trireme.' _Eperon_ ordinarily means 'spur.'
The ancient trireme was a galley with three banks of oars.

_93_ 19 _viennent ensemble se ranger:_ 'come to draw up together,' 'draw
up together', cf. _55_ 8.--_aux flancs du:_ 'alongside.' Note the plural
_flancs_, cf. _� ses c�t�s_ _37_ 26.

_93_ 21 _A la fin:_ 'I tell you.'

_93_ 22 _� mon bord:_ 'aboard.' _A bord d'un vaisseau_ = 'on board a
ship.'

'placards')

_94_ 1 _mettait le nez:_ 'stuck his nose,' looked out.

_94_ 9 _un wagon de troisi�me classe:_ 'a third-class car.' In French
trains there are cars of first, second, and third classes, the third being
the cheapest. The cars were until recently divided into compartments from
each of which a door (_portiere_) opened upon the station platform. These
doors were provided with windows--_filant bon train sur:_ 'making rapidly
for', cf. note to _84_ 23.

_94_ 11 _aux porti�res:_ 'at the door Windows', cf. note to _94_ 9.

_94_ 13 _d�talait:_ cf. note to _69_ 15.

which cover this plain are fabled to have been showered down by Jupiter to
aid Hercules in his battle with the giant Albion.--lui tenant pied:
'keeping up with it.'

_94_ 15 _rencoigna:_ an old spelling of _rencogna._ The word is
etymologically connected with _coin_; cf. English (Shakespearean) 'coign.'

_94_ 19 _Pas le sou:_ 'penniless'; _je n'ai pas le sou_ = 'I haven't a
cent.'

_94_ 21 _Tarascon!_ for the electrifying sonorousness of this call cf.
note to _1_ 1.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
