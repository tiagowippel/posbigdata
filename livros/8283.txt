Book 56 Titus
001:001 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
        according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the knowledge
        of the truth which is according to godliness,
001:002 in hope of eternal life, which God, who can't lie,
        promised before time began;
001:003 but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I
        was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;
001:004 to Titus, my true child according to a common faith:
        Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the
        Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
001:005 I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order
        the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city,
        as I directed you;
001:006 if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children
        who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.
001:007 For the overseer must be blameless, as God's steward;
        not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine,
        not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;
001:008 but given to hospitality, as a lover of good, sober minded,
        fair, holy, self-controlled;
001:009 holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching,
        that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine,
        and to convict those who contradict him.
001:010 For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers,
        especially those of the circumcision,
001:011 whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses,
        teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake.
001:012 One of them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars,
        evil beasts, and idle gluttons."
001:013 This testimony is true.  For this cause, reprove them sharply,
        that they may be sound in the faith,
001:014 not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men
        who turn away from the truth.
001:015 To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled
        and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their
        conscience are defiled.
001:016 They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him,
        being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
002:001 But say the things which fit sound doctrine,
002:002 that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded,
        sound in faith, in love, and in patience:
002:003 and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior,
        not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that
        which is good;
002:004 that they may train the young women to love their husbands,
        to love their children,
002:005 to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in
        subjection to their own husbands, that God's word may
        not be blasphemed.
002:006 Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;
002:007 in all things showing yourself an example of good works;
        in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,
002:008 and soundness of speech that can't be condemned; that he who opposes
        you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.
002:009 Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters,
        and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;
002:010 not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn
        the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.
002:011 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
002:012 instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and
        worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly
        in this present world;
002:013 looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our
        great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;
002:014 who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
        and purify for himself a people for his own possession,
        zealous for good works.
002:015 Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority.
        Let no man despise you.
003:001 Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities,
        to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,
003:002 to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle,
        showing all humility toward all men.
003:003 For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived,
        serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice
        and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
003:004 But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love
        toward mankind appeared,
003:005 not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves,
        but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing
        of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,
003:006 whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;
003:007 that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs
        according to the hope of eternal life.
003:008 This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I
        desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have
        believed God may be careful to maintain good works.
        These things are good and profitable to men;
003:009 but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes
        about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
003:010 Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;
003:011 knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.
003:012 When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come
        to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.
003:013 Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily,
        that nothing may be lacking for them.
003:014 Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses,
        that they may not be unfruitful.
003:015 All who are with me greet you.  Greet those who love us in faith.
        Grace be with you all.  Amen.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05

Or /etext04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92,
91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
