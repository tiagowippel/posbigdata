Book 60        1 Peter

60:001:001 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
           throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

60:001:002 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
           through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and
           sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and
           peace, be multiplied.

60:001:003 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
           according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a
           lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

60:001:004 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that
           fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,

60:001:005 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation
           ready to be revealed in the last time.

60:001:006 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need
           be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:

60:001:007 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of
           gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be
           found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of
           Jesus Christ:

60:001:008 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him
           not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
           of glory:

60:001:009 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
           souls.

60:001:010 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
           diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto
           you:

60:001:011 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
           which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand
           the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.

60:001:012 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto
           us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto
           you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the
           Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels
           desire to look into.

60:001:013 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope
           to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the
           revelation of Jesus Christ;

60:001:014 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to
           the former lusts in your ignorance:

60:001:015 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all
           manner of conversation;

60:001:016 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.

60:001:017 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons
           judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your
           sojourning here in fear:

60:001:018 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
           corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
           conversation received by tradition from your fathers;

60:001:019 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
           blemish and without spot:

60:001:020 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the
           world, but was manifest in these last times for you,

60:001:021 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the
           dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in
           God.

60:001:022 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth
           through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see
           that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:

60:001:023 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
           incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth
           for ever.

60:001:024 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the
           flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof
           falleth away:

60:001:025 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the
           word which by the gospel is preached unto you.

60:002:001 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and
           hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,

60:002:002 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye
           may grow thereby:

60:002:003 If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

60:002:004 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of
           men, but chosen of God, and precious,

60:002:005 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an
           holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable
           to God by Jesus Christ.

60:002:006 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay
           in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that
           believeth on him shall not be confounded.

60:002:007 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them
           which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed,
           the same is made the head of the corner,

60:002:008 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them
           which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also
           they were appointed.

60:002:009 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
           nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the
           praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his
           marvellous light;

60:002:010 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people
           of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained
           mercy.

60:002:011 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims,
           abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;

60:002:012 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that,
           whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your
           good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of
           visitation.

60:002:013 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
           sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;

60:002:014 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the
           punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do
           well.

60:002:015 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
           silence the ignorance of foolish men:

60:002:016 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of
           maliciousness, but as the servants of God.

60:002:017 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the
           king.

60:002:018 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only
           to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.

60:002:019 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
           endure grief, suffering wrongfully.

60:002:020 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults,
           ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and
           suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with
           God.

60:002:021 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered
           for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his
           steps:

60:002:022 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:

60:002:023 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered,
           he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
           righteously:

60:002:024 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
           that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness:
           by whose stripes ye were healed.

60:002:025 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto
           the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

60:003:001 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands;
           that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word
           be won by the conversation of the wives;

60:003:002 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.

60:003:003 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting
           the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;

60:003:004 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is
           not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
           which is in the sight of God of great price.

60:003:005 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who
           trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto
           their own husbands:

60:003:006 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters
           ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any
           amazement.

60:003:007 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,
           giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as
           being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers
           be not hindered.

60:003:008 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of
           another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:

60:003:009 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but
           contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called,
           that ye should inherit a blessing.

60:003:010 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
           his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:

60:003:011 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and
           ensue it.

60:003:012 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears
           are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is
           against them that do evil.

60:003:013 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
           which is good?

60:003:014 But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye:
           and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;

60:003:015 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always
           to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the
           hope that is in you with meekness and fear:

60:003:016 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of
           you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse
           your good conversation in Christ.

60:003:017 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
           well doing, than for evil doing.

60:003:018 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
           unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in
           the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

60:003:019 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;

60:003:020 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering
           of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a
           preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by
           water.

60:003:021 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us
           (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the
           answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection
           of Jesus Christ:

60:003:022 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God;
           angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.

60:004:001 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,
           arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath
           suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;

60:004:002 That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the
           flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.

60:004:003 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought
           the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness,
           lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable
           idolatries:

60:004:004 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the
           same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:

60:004:005 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick
           and the dead.

60:004:006 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that
           are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the
           flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.

60:004:007 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober,
           and watch unto prayer.

60:004:008 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves:
           for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.

60:004:009 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.

60:004:010 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same
           one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

60:004:011 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any
           man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God
           giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus
           Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.
           Amen.

60:004:012 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which
           is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:

60:004:013 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
           sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be
           glad also with exceeding joy.

60:004:014 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for
           the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part
           he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.

60:004:015 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as
           an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.

60:004:016 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;
           but let him glorify God on this behalf.

60:004:017 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
           God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of
           them that obey not the gospel of God?

60:004:018 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the
           ungodly and the sinner appear?

60:004:019 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God
           commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as
           unto a faithful Creator.

60:005:001 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder,
           and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker
           of the glory that shall be revealed:

60:005:002 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
           thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy
           lucre, but of a ready mind;

60:005:003 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being
           ensamples to the flock.

60:005:004 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a
           crown of glory that fadeth not away.

60:005:005 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea,
           all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with
           humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the
           humble.

60:005:006 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that
           he may exalt you in due time:

60:005:007 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

60:005:008 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
           roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

60:005:009 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same
           afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the
           world.

60:005:010 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
           glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while,
           make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.

60:005:011 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

60:005:012 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have
           written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the
           true grace of God wherein ye stand.

60:005:013 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,
           saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.

60:005:014 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you
           all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:

Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the

[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"

          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
