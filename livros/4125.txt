PREFACE

Although the Diary of Samuel Pepys has been in the hands of the public
for nearly seventy years, it has not hitherto appeared in its entirety.
In the original edition of 1825 scarcely half of the manuscript was
printed. Lord Braybrooke added some passages as the various editions
were published, but in the preface to his last edition he wrote: "there
appeared indeed no necessity to amplify or in any way to alter the text
of the Diary beyond the correction of a few verbal errors and corrupt
passages hitherto overlooked."

The public knew nothing as to what was left unprinted, and there was
therefore a general feeling of gratification when it was announced some
eighteen years ago that a new edition was to be published by the Rev.
Mynors Bright, with the addition of new matter equal to a third of the
whole. It was understood that at last the Diary was to appear in
its entirety, but there was a passage in Mr. Bright's preface which
suggested a doubt respecting the necessary completeness. He wrote: "It
would have been tedious to the reader if I had copied from the Diary the
account of his daily work at the office."

As a matter of fact, Mr. Bright left roughly speaking about one-fifth of
the whole Diary still unprinted, although he transcribed the whole, and
bequeathed his transcript to Magdalene College.

It has now been decided that the whole of the Diary shall be made
public, with the exception of a few passages which cannot possibly be
printed. It may be thought by some that these omissions are due to an
unnecessary squeamishness, but it is not really so, and readers are
therefore asked to have faith in the judgment of the editor. Where any
passages have been omitted marks of omission are added, so that in all
cases readers will know where anything has been left out.

Lord Braybrooke made the remark in his "Life of Pepys," that "the cipher
employed by him greatly resembles that known by the name of 'Rich's
system.'" When Mr. Bright came to decipher the MS., he discovered that
the shorthand system used by Pepys was an earlier one than Rich's, viz.,
that of Thomas Shelton, who made his system public in 1620.

In his various editions Lord Braybrooke gave a large number of valuable
notes, in the collection and arrangement of which he was assisted by
the late Mr. John Holmes of the British Museum, and the late Mr. James
Yeowell, sometime sub-editor of "Notes and Queries." Where these notes
are left unaltered in the present edition the letter "B." has been
affixed to them, but in many instances the notes have been altered and
added to from later information, and in these cases no mark is affixed.
A large number of additional notes are now supplied, but still much has
had to be left unexplained. Many persons are mentioned in the Diary who
were little known in the outer world, and in some instances it has
been impossible to identify them. In other cases, however, it has been
possible to throw light upon these persons by reference to different
portions of the Diary itself. I would here ask the kind assistance
of any reader who is able to illustrate passages that have been left
unnoted. I have received much assistance from the various books in which
the Diary is quoted. Every writer on the period covered by the Diary
has been pleased to illustrate his subject by quotations from Pepys, and
from these books it has often been possible to find information which
helps to explain difficult passages in the Diary.

Much illustrative matter of value was obtained by Lord Braybrooke from
the "Diurnall" of Thomas Rugge, which is preserved in the British Museum
(Add. MSS. 10,116, 10,117). The following is the description of this
interesting work as given by Lord Braybrooke

                    "MERCURIUS POLITICUS REDIVIVUS;

  or, A Collection of the most materiall occurrances and transactions
            in Public Affairs since Anno Dni, 1659, untill
                            28 March, 1672,
      serving as an annuall diurnall for future satisfaction and
                             information,
                            BY THOMAS RUGGE.

             Est natura hominum novitatis avida.--Plinius.

     "This MS. belonged, in 1693, to Thomas Grey, second Earl of
     Stamford.  It has his autograph at the commencement, and on the
     sides are his arms (four quarterings) in gold.  In 1819, it was sold
     by auction in London, as part of the collection of Thomas Lloyd,
     Esq.  (No. 1465), and was then bought by Thomas Thorpe, bookseller.
     Whilst Mr. Lloyd was the possessor, the MS. was lent to Dr. Lingard,
     whose note of thanks to Mr. Lloyd is preserved in the volume.  From
     Thorpe it appears to have passed to Mr. Heber, at the sale of whose
     MSS. in Feb.  1836, by Mr. Evans, of Pall Mall, it was purchased by
     the British Museum for L8 8s.

     "Thomas Rugge was descended from an ancient Norfolk family, and two
     of his ancestors are described as Aldermen of Norwich.  His death
     has been ascertained to have occurred about 1672; and in the Diary
     for the preceding year he complains that on account of his declining
     health, his entries will be but few.  Nothing has been traced of his
     personal circumstances beyond the fact of his having lived for
     fourteen years in Covent Garden, then a fashionable locality."

Another work I have found of the greatest value is the late Mr. J. E.
Doyle's "Official Baronage of England" (1886), which contains a mass of
valuable information not easily to be obtained elsewhere. By reference
to its pages I have been enabled to correct several erroneous dates in
previous notes caused by a very natural confusion of years in the case
of the months of January, February, and March, before it was finally
fixed that the year should commence in January instead of March. More
confusion has probably been introduced into history from this than from
any other cause of a like nature. The reference to two years, as in the
case of, say, Jan. 5, 1661-62, may appear clumsy, but it is the only
safe plan of notation. If one year only is mentioned, the reader is
never sure whether or not the correction has been made. It is a matter
for sincere regret that the popular support was withheld from Mr.
Doyle's important undertaking, so that the author's intention of
publishing further volumes, containing the Baronies not dealt with in
those already published, was frustrated.

My labours have been much lightened by the kind help which I have
received from those interested in the subject. Lovers of Pepys are
numerous, and I have found those I have applied to ever willing to
give me such information as they possess. It is a singular pleasure,
therefore, to have an opportunity of expressing publicly my thanks
to these gentlemen, and among them I would especially mention Messrs.
Fennell, Danby P. Fry, J. Eliot Hodgkin, Henry Jackson, J. K. Laughton,
Julian Marshall, John Biddulph Martin, J. E. Matthew, Philip Norman,
Richard B. Prosser, and Hugh Callendar, Fellow of Trinity College,
who verified some of the passages in the manuscript. To the Master
and Fellows of Magdalene College, also, I am especially indebted for
allowing me to consult the treasures of the Pepysian Library, and more
particularly my thanks are due to Mr. Arthur G. Peskett, the Librarian.

                 PARTICULARS OF THE LIFE OF SAMUEL PEPYS.

The family of Pepys is one of considerable antiquity in the east of
England, and the Hon. Walter Courtenay Pepys

     [Mr. W.  C.  Pepys has paid great attention to the history of his
     family, and in 1887 he published an interesting work entitled
     "Genealogy of the Pepys Family, 1273-1887," London, George Bell and
     Sons, which contains the fullest pedigrees of the family yet
     issued.]

says that the first mention of the name that he has been able to find is
in the Hundred Rolls (Edw. I, 1273), where Richard Pepis and John Pepes
are registered as holding lands in the county of Cambridge. In the next
century the name of William Pepis is found in deeds relating to lands in
the parish of Cottenham, co. Cambridge, dated 1329 and 1340 respectively
(Cole MSS., British Museum, vol. i., p. 56; vol. xlii., p. 44).
According to the Court Roll of the manor of Pelhams, in the parish of
Cottenham, Thomas Pepys was "bayliffe of the Abbot of Crowland in 1434,"
but in spite of these references, as well as others to persons of
the same name at Braintree, Essex, Depedale, Norfolk, &c., the first
ancestor of the existing branches of the family from whom Mr. Walter
Pepys is able to trace an undoubted descent, is "William Pepis the
elder, of Cottenham, co. Cambridge," whose will is dated 20th March,
1519.

In 1852 a curious manuscript volume, bound in vellum, and entitled
"Liber Talboti Pepys de instrumentis ad Feoda pertinentibus
exemplificatis," was discovered in an old chest in the parish church of
Bolney, Sussex, by the vicar, the Rev. John Dale, who delivered it
to Henry Pepys, Bishop of Worcester, and the book is still in the
possession of the family. This volume contains various genealogical
entries, and among them are references to the Thomas Pepys of 1434
mentioned above, and to the later William Pepys. The reference to the
latter runs thus:--

     "A Noate written out of an ould Booke of my uncle William Pepys."

     "William Pepys, who died at Cottenham, 10 H. 8, was brought up by
     the Abbat of Crowland, in Huntingdonshire, and he was borne in
     Dunbar, in Scotland, a gentleman, whom the said Abbat did make his
     Bayliffe of all his lands in Cambridgeshire, and placed him in
     Cottenham, which William aforesaid had three sonnes, Thomas, John,
     and William, to whom Margaret was mother naturallie, all of whom
     left issue."

In illustration of this entry we may refer to the Diary of June 12th,
1667, where it is written that Roger Pepys told Samuel that "we
did certainly come out of Scotland with the Abbot of Crowland." The
references to various members of the family settled in Cottenham and
elsewhere, at an early date already alluded to, seem to show that there
is little foundation for this very positive statement.

With regard to the standing of the family, Mr. Walter Pepys writes:--

     "The first of the name in 1273 were evidently but small copyholders.
     Within 150 years (1420) three or four of the name had entered the
     priesthood, and others had become connected with the monastery of
     Croyland as bailiffs, &c.  In 250 years (1520) there were certainly
     two families: one at Cottenham, co. Cambridge, and another at
     Braintree, co. Essex, in comfortable circumstances as yeomen
     farmers.  Within fifty years more (1563), one of the family, Thomas,
     of Southcreeke, co. Norfolk, had entered the ranks of the gentry
     sufficiently to have his coat-of-arms recognized by the Herald
     Cooke, who conducted the Visitation of Norfolk in that year.  From
     that date the majority of the family have been in good
     circumstances, with perhaps more than the average of its members
     taking up public positions."

There is a very general notion that Samuel Pepys was of plebeian birth
because his father followed the trade of a tailor, and his own remark,
"But I believe indeed our family were never considerable,"--[February
10th, 1661-62.] has been brought forward in corroboration of this view,
but nothing can possibly be more erroneous, and there can be no doubt
that the Diarist was really proud of his descent. This may be seen from
the inscription on one of his book-plates, where he is stated to be:--

     "Samuel Pepys of Brampton in Huntingdonshire, Esq., Secretary of the
     Admiralty to his Matr. King Charles the Second: Descended from ye
     antient family of Pepys of Cottenham in Cambridgeshire."

Many members of the family have greatly distinguished themselves since
the Diarist's day, and of them Mr. Foss wrote ("Judges of England," vol.
vi., p. 467):--

     "In the family of Pepys is illustrated every gradation of legal rank
     from Reader of an Inn of Court to Lord High Chancellor of England."

The William Pepys of Cottenham who commences the pedigree had three sons
and three daughters; from the eldest son (Thomas) descended the
first Norfolk branch, from the second son (John Pepys of Southcreeke)
descended the second Norfolk branch, and from the third son (William)
descended the Impington branch. The latter William had four sons and two
daughters; two of these sons were named Thomas, and as they were both
living at the same time one was distinguished as "the black" and the
other as "the red." Thomas the red had four sons and four daughters.
John, born 1601, was the third son, and he became the father of Samuel
the Diarist. Little is known of John Pepys, but we learn when the Diary
opens that he was settled in London as a tailor. He does not appear to
have been a successful man, and his son on August 26th, 1661, found that
there was only L45 owing to him, and that he owed about the same sum.
He was a citizen of London in 1650, when his son Samuel was admitted
to Magdalene College, but at an earlier period he appears to have had
business relations with Holland.

In August, 1661, John Pepys retired to a small property at Brampton
(worth about L80 per annum), which had been left to him by his eldest
brother, Robert Pepys, where he died in 1680.

The following is a copy of John Pepys's will:

                            "MY FATHER'S WILL.
                        [Indorsement by S. Pepys.]

     "Memorandum.  That I, John Pepys of Ellington, in the county of
     Huntingdon, Gent.", doe declare my mind in the disposall of my
     worldly goods as followeth:

     "First, I desire that my lands and goods left mee by my brother,
     Robert Pepys, deceased, bee delivered up to my eldest son, Samuell
     Pepys, of London, Esqr., according as is expressed in the last Will
     of my brother Robert aforesaid.

     "Secondly, As for what goods I have brought from London, or procured
     since, and what moneys I shall leave behind me or due to me, I
     desire may be disposed of as followeth:

     "Imprimis, I give to the stock of the poore of the parish of
     Brampton, in which church I desire to be enterred, five pounds.

     "Item.  I give to the Poore of Ellington forty shillings.

     "Item.  I desire that my two grandsons, Samuell and John Jackson,
     have ten pounds a piece.

     "Item.  I desire that my daughter, Paulina Jackson, may have my
     largest silver tankerd.

     "Item.  I desire that my son John Pepys may have my gold seale-ring.

     "Lastly.  I desire that the remainder of what I shall leave be
     equally distributed between my sons Samuel and John Pepys and my
     daughter Paulina Jackson.

     "All which I leave to the care of my eldest son Samuel Pepys, to see
     performed, if he shall think fit.

     "In witness hereunto I set my hand."

His wife Margaret, whose maiden name has not been discovered, died
on the 25th March, 1667, also at Brampton. The family of these two
consisted of six sons and five daughters: John (born 1632, died 1640),
Samuel (born 1633, died 1703), Thomas (born 1634, died 1664), Jacob
(born 1637, died young), Robert (born 1638, died young), and John (born
1641, died 1677); Mary (born 1627), Paulina (born 1628), Esther (born
1630), Sarah (born 1635; these four girls all died young), and Paulina
(born 1640, died 1680), who married John Jackson of Brampton, and had
two sons, Samuel and John. The latter was made his heir by Samuel Pepys.

Samuel Pepys was born on the 23rd February, 1632-3, but the place of
birth is not known with certainty. Samuel Knight, D.D., author of the
"Life of Colet," who was a connection of the family (having married
Hannah Pepys, daughter of Talbot Pepys of Impington), says positively
that it was at Brampton. His statement cannot be corroborated by the
registers of Brampton church, as these records do not commence until the
year 1654.

Samuel's early youth appears to have been spent pretty equally between
town and country. When he and his brother Tom were children they lived
with a nurse (Goody Lawrence) at Kingsland, and in after life Samuel
refers to his habit of shooting with bow and arrow in the fields around
that place. He then went to school at Huntingdon, from which he was
transferred to St. Paul's School in London. He remained at the latter
place until 1650, early in which year his name was entered as a sizar on
the boards of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He was admitted on the 21st June,
but subsequently he transferred his allegiance to Magdalene College,
where he was admitted a sizar on the 1st October of this same year.
He did not enter into residence until March 5th, 1650-51, but in the
following month he was elected to one of Mr. Spendluffe's scholarships,
and two years later (October 14th, 1653) he was preferred to one on Dr.
John Smith's foundation.

Little or nothing is known of Pepys's career at college, but soon
after obtaining the Smith scholarship he got into trouble, and, with a
companion, was admonished for being drunk.

     [October 21st, 1653.  "Memorandum: that Peapys and Hind were
     solemnly admonished by myself and Mr. Hill, for having been
     scandalously over-served with drink ye night before.  This was done
     in the presence of all the Fellows then resident, in Mr. Hill's
     chamber.--JOHN WOOD, Registrar."  (From the Registrar's-book of
     Magdalene College.)]

His time, however, was not wasted, and there is evidence that he carried
into his busy life a fair stock of classical learning and a true love of
letters. Throughout his life he looked back with pleasure to the time he
spent at the University, and his college was remembered in his will
when he bequeathed his valuable library. In this same year, 1653, he
graduated B.A. On the 1st of December, 1655, when he was still without
any settled means of support, he married Elizabeth St. Michel, a
beautiful and portionless girl of fifteen. Her father, Alexander
Marchant, Sieur de St. Michel, was of a good family in Anjou, and son of
the High Sheriff of Bauge (in Anjou). Having turned Huguenot at the age
of twenty-one, when in the German service, his father disinherited him,
and he also lost the reversion of some L20,000 sterling which his uncle,
a rich French canon, intended to bequeath to him before he left the
Roman Catholic church. He came over to England in the retinue of
Henrietta Maria on her marriage with Charles I, but the queen dismissed
him on finding that he was a Protestant and did not attend mass. Being a
handsome man, with courtly manners, he found favour in the sight of
the widow of an Irish squire (daughter of Sir Francis Kingsmill),
who married him against the wishes of her family. After the marriage,
Alexander St. Michel and his wife having raised some fifteen hundred
pounds, started, for France in the hope of recovering some part of the
family property. They were unfortunate in all their movements, and on
their journey to France were taken prisoners by the Dunkirkers, who
stripped them of all their property. They now settled at Bideford in
Devonshire, and here or near by were born Elizabeth and the rest of the
family. At a later period St. Michel served against the Spaniards at the
taking of Dunkirk and Arras, and settled at Paris. He was an unfortunate
man throughout life, and his son Balthasar says of him: "My father at
last grew full of whimsies and propositions of perpetual motion, &c., to
kings, princes and others, which soaked his pocket, and brought all our
family so low by his not minding anything else, spending all he had got
and getting no other employment to bring in more." While he was away
from Paris, some "deluding papists" and "pretended devouts" persuaded
Madame St. Michel to place her daughter in the nunnery of the Ursulines.
When the father heard of this, he hurried back, and managed to get
Elizabeth out of the nunnery after she had been there twelve days.
Thinking that France was a dangerous place to live in, he removed his
family to England, where soon afterwards his daughter was married,
although, as Lord Braybrooke remarks, we are not told how she became
acquainted with Pepys. St. Michel was greatly pleased that his daughter
had become the wife of a true Protestant, and she herself said to him,
kissing his eyes: "Dear father, though in my tender years I was by
my low fortune in this world deluded to popery, by the fond dictates
thereof I have now (joined with my riper years, which give me some
understanding) a man to my husband too wise and one too religious to the
Protestant religion to suffer my thoughts to bend that way any more."

     [These particulars are obtained from an interesting letter from
     Balthasar St. Michel to Pepys, dated "Deal, Feb. 8, 1673-4," and
     printed in "Life, Journals, and Correspondence of Samuel Pepys,"
     1841, vol. i., pp. 146-53.]

Alexander St. Michel kept up his character for fecklessness through
life, and took out patents for curing smoking chimneys, purifying water,
and moulding bricks. In 1667 he petitioned the king, asserting that he
had discovered King Solomon's gold and silver mines, and the Diary
of the same date contains a curious commentary upon these visions of
wealth:--

     "March 29, 1667.  4s. a week which his (Balty St. Michel's) father
     receives of the French church is all the subsistence his father and
     mother have, and about; L20 a year maintains them."

As already noted, Pepys was married on December 1st, 1655. This date
is given on the authority of the Registers of St. Margaret's Church,
Westminster,

     [The late Mr. T. C. Noble kindly communicated to me a copy of the
     original marriage certificate, which is as follows: "Samuell Peps
     of this parish Gent. & Elizabeth De Snt. Michell of Martins in the
     fields, Spinster.  Published October 19tn, 22nd, 29th 1655, and
     were married by Richard Sherwin Esqr one of the justices of the
     Peace of the Cittie and Lyberties of Westm.  December 1st.  (Signed)
     Ri. Sherwin."]

but strangely enough Pepys himself supposed his wedding day to have been
October 10th. Lord Braybrooke remarks on this,

     "It is notorious that the registers in those times were very ill
     kept, of which we have here a striking instance....  Surely a
     man who kept a diary could not have made such a blunder."

What is even more strange than Pepys's conviction that he was married on
October 10th is Mrs. Pepys's agreement with him: On October 10th, 1666,
we read,

     "So home to supper, and to bed, it being my wedding night, but how
     many years I cannot tell; but my wife says ten."

Here Mrs. Pepys was wrong, as it was eleven years; so she may have been
wrong in the day also. In spite of the high authority of Mr. and Mrs.
Pepys on a question so interesting to them both, we must accept the
register as conclusive on this point until further evidence of its
incorrectness is forthcoming.

Sir Edward Montage (afterwards Earl of Sandwich), who was Pepys's
first cousin one remove (Pepys's grandfather and Montage's mother being
brother and sister), was a true friend to his poor kinsman, and he at
once held out a helping hand to the imprudent couple, allowing them
to live in his house. John Pepys does not appear to have been in
sufficiently good circumstances to pay for the education of his son,
and it seems probable that Samuel went to the university under his
influential cousin's patronage. At all events he owed his success in
life primarily to Montage, to whom he appears to have acted as a sort of
agent.

On March 26th, 1658, he underwent a successful operation for the stone,
and we find him celebrating each anniversary of this important event of
his life with thanksgiving. He went through life with little trouble
on this score, but when he died at the age of seventy a nest of seven
stones was found in his left kidney.

     ["June 10th, 1669.  I went this evening to London, to carry Mr.
     Pepys to my brother Richard, now exceedingly afflicted with the
     stone, who had been successfully cut, and carried the stone, as big
     as a tennis ball, to show him and encourage his resolution to go
     thro' the operation."--Evelyn's Diary.]

In June, 1659, Pepys accompanied Sir Edward Montage in the "Naseby,"
when the Admiral of the Baltic Fleet and Algernon Sidney went to the
Sound as joint commissioners. It was then that Montage corresponded with
Charles II., but he had to be very secret in his movements on account of
the suspicions of Sidney. Pepys knew nothing of what was going on, as he
confesses in the Diary:

     "I do from this raise an opinion of him, to be one of the most
     secret men in the world, which I was not so convinced of before."

On Pepys's return to England he obtained an appointment in the office of
Mr., afterwards Sir George Downing, who was one of the Four Tellers of
the Receipt of the Exchequer. He was clerk to Downing when he commenced
his diary on January 1st, 1660, and then lived in Axe Yard, close by
King Street, Westminster, a place on the site of which was built Fludyer
Street. This, too, was swept away for the Government offices in 1864-65.
His salary was L50 a year. Downing invited Pepys to accompany him to
Holland, but he does not appear to have been very pressing, and a few
days later in this same January he got him appointed one of the Clerks
of the Council, but the recipient of the favour does not appear to
have been very grateful. A great change was now about to take place in
Pepys's fortunes, for in the following March he was made secretary to
Sir Edward Montage in his expedition to bring about the Restoration
of Charles II., and on the 23rd he went on board the "Swiftsure" with
Montage. On the 30th they transferred themselves to the "Naseby." Owing
to this appointment of Pepys we have in the Diary a very full account
of the daily movements of the fleet until, events having followed their
natural course, Montage had the honour of bringing Charles II. to Dover,
where the King was received with great rejoicing. Several of the ships
in the fleet had names which were obnoxious to Royalists, and on the
23rd May the King came on board the "Naseby" and altered there--the
"Naseby" to the "Charles," the "Richard" to the "Royal James," the
"Speaker" to the "Mary," the "Winsby" to the "Happy Return," the
"Wakefield" to the "Richmond," the "Lambert" to the "Henrietta," the
"Cheriton" to the "Speedwell," and the "Bradford" to the "Success."
This portion of the Diary is of particular interest, and the various
excursions in Holland which the Diarist made are described in a very
amusing manner.

When Montagu and Pepys had both returned to London, the former told the
latter that he had obtained the promise of the office of Clerk of the
Acts for him. Many difficulties occurred before Pepys actually secured
the place, so that at times he was inclined to accept the offers which
were made to him to give it up. General Monk was anxious to get the
office for Mr. Turner, who was Chief Clerk in the Navy Office, but in
the end Montagu's influence secured it for Pepys. Then Thomas Barlow,
who had been appointed Clerk of the Acts in 1638, turned up, and
appeared likely to become disagreeable. Pepys bought him off with an
annuity of too, which he did not have to pay for any length of time,
as Barlow died in February, 1664-65. It is not in human nature to be
greatly grieved at the death of one to whom you have to pay an annuity,
and Pepys expresses his feelings in a very naive manner:--

     "For which God knows my heart I could be as sorry as is possible for
     one to be for a stranger by whose death he gets L100 per annum, he
     being a worthy honest man; but when I come to consider the
     providence of God by this means unexpectedly to give me L100 a year
     more in my estate, I have cause to bless God, and do it from the
     bottom of my heart."

This office was one of considerable importance, for not only was the
holder the secretary or registrar of the Navy Board, but he was also one
of the principal officers of the navy, and, as member of the board, of
equal rank with the other commissioners. This office Pepys held during
the whole period of the Diary, and we find him constantly fighting for
his position, as some of the other members wished to reduce his rank
merely to that of secretary. In his contention Pepys appears to have
been in the right, and a valuable MS. volume in the Pepysian library
contains an extract from the Old Instructions of about 1649, in which
this very point is argued out. The volume appears to have been made
up by William Penn the Quaker, from a collection of manuscripts on the
affairs of the navy found in his father's, "Sir William Penn's closet."
It was presented to Charles II., with a dedication ending thus:--

     "I hope enough to justifie soe much freedome with a Prince that is
     so easie to excuse things well intended as this is
                         "BY
                              "Great Prince,
                                   "Thy faithfull subject,
                                        "WM. PENN"

     "London, the 22 of the Mo. called June, 1680."

It does not appear how the volume came into Pepys's possession. It may
have been given him by the king, or he may have taken it as a perquisite
of his office. The book has an index, which was evidently added by
Pepys; in this are these entries, which show his appreciation of the
contents of the MS.:--

               "Clerk of the Acts,
                    his duty,
                    his necessity and usefulness."

The following description of the duty of the Clerk of the Acts shows
the importance of the office, and the statement that if the clerk is
not fitted to act as a commissioner he is a blockhead and unfit for his
employment is particularly racy, and not quite the form of expression
one would expect to find in an official document:

                           "CLERKE OF THE ACTS.

     "The clarke of the Navye's duty depends principally upon rateing (by
     the Board's approbation) of all bills and recording of them, and all
     orders, contracts & warrants, making up and casting of accompts,
     framing and writing answers to letters, orders, and commands from
     the Councell, Lord High Admirall, or Commissioners of the Admiralty,
     and he ought to be a very able accomptant, well versed in Navall
     affairs and all inferior officers dutyes.

     "It hath been objected by some that the Clarke of the Acts ought to
     be subordinate to the rest of the Commissioners, and not to be
     joyned in equall power with them, although he was so constituted
     from the first institution, which hath been an opinion only of some
     to keep him at a distance, least he might be thought too forward if
     he had joynt power in discovering or argueing against that which
     peradventure private interest would have concealed; it is certaine
     no man sees more of the Navye's Transactions than himselfe, and
     possibly may speak as much to the project if required, or else he is
     a blockhead, and not fitt for that imployment.  But why he should
     not make as able a Commissioner as a Shipp wright lett wise men
     judge."

In Pepys's patent the salary is stated to be L33 6s. 8d., but this was
only the ancient "fee out of the Exchequer," which had been attached to
the office for more than a century. Pepys's salary had been previously
fixed at L350 a-year.

Neither of the two qualifications upon which particular stress is laid
in the above Instructions was possessed by Pepys. He knew nothing about
the navy, and so little of accounts that apparently he learned the
multiplication table for the first time in July, 1661. We see from
the particulars given in the Diary how hard he worked to obtain the
knowledge required in his office, and in consequence of his assiduity
he soon became a model official. When Pepys became Clerk of the Acts
he took up his residence at the Navy Office, a large building situated
between Crutched Friars and Seething Lane, with an entrance in each of
those places. On July 4th, 1660, he went with Commissioner Pett to view
the houses, and was very pleased with them, but he feared that the more
influential officers would jockey him out of his rights. His fears were
not well grounded, and on July 18th he records the fact that he dined in
his own apartments, which were situated in the Seething Lane front.

On July 24th, 1660, Pepys was sworn in as Lord Sandwich's deputy for a
Clerkship of the Privy Seal. This office, which he did not think much
of at first, brought him "in for a time L3 a day." In June, 1660, he was
made Master of Arts by proxy, and soon afterwards he was sworn in as
a justice of the Peace for Middlesex, Essex, Kent, and Hampshire, the
counties in which the chief dockyards were situated.

Pepys's life is written large in the Diary, and it is not necessary here
to do more than catalogue the chief incidents of it in chronological
order. In February, 1661-62, he was chosen a Younger Brother of
the Trinity House, and in April, 1662, when on an official visit to
Portsmouth Dockyard, he was made a burgess of the town. In August of the
same year he was appointed one of the commissioners for the affairs of
Tangier. Soon afterwards Thomas Povy, the treasurer, got his accounts
into a muddle, and showed himself incompetent for the place, so that
Pepys replaced him as treasurer to the commission.

In March, 1663-64, the Corporation of the Royal Fishery was appointed,
with the Duke of York as governor, and thirty-two assistants, mostly
"very great persons." Through Lord Sandwich's influence Pepys was made
one of these.

The time was now arriving when Pepys's general ability and devotion to
business brought him prominently into notice. During the Dutch war the
unreadiness of the ships, more particularly in respect to victualling,
was the cause of great trouble. The Clerk of the Acts did his utmost
to set things right, and he was appointed Surveyor-General of the
Victualling Office. The kind way in which Mr. Coventry proposed him
as "the fittest man in England" for the office, and the Duke of York's
expressed approval, greatly pleased him.

During the fearful period when the Plague was raging, Pepys stuck to his
business, and the chief management of naval affairs devolved upon him,
for the meetings at the Navy Office were but thinly attended. In a
letter to Coventry he wrote:--

     "The sickness in general thickens round us, and particularly upon
     our neighbourhood.  You, sir, took your turn of the sword; I must
     not, therefore, grudge to take mine of the pestilence."

At this time his wife was living at Woolwich, and he himself with his
clerks at Greenwich; one maid only remained in the house in London.

Pepys rendered special service at the time of the Fire of London. He
communicated the king's wishes to the Lord Mayor, and he saved the Navy
Office by having up workmen from Woolwich and Deptford Dockyards to pull
down the houses around, and so prevent the spread of the flames.

When peace was at length concluded with the Dutch, and people had
time to think over the disgrace which the country had suffered by the
presence of De Ruyter's fleet in the Medway, it was natural that a
public inquiry into the management of the war should be undertaken. A
Parliamentary Committee was appointed in October, 1667, to inquire into
the matter. Pepys made a statement which satisfied the committee, but
for months afterwards he was continually being summoned to answer some
charge, so that he confesses himself as mad to "become the hackney of
this office in perpetual trouble and vexation that need it least."

At last a storm broke out in the House of Commons against the principal
officers of the navy, and some members demanded that they should be put
out of their places. In the end they were ordered to be heard in their
own defence at the bar of the House. The whole labour of the defence
fell upon Pepys, but having made out his case with great skill, he was
rewarded by a most unexpected success. On the 5th March, 1667-68, he
made the great speech of his life, and spoke for three hours, with the
effect that he so far removed the prejudice against the officers of the
Navy Board, that no further proceedings were taken in parliament on the
subject. He was highly praised for his speech, and he was naturally much
elated at his brilliant success.

About the year 1664 we first hear of a defect in Pepys's eyesight. He
consulted the celebrated Cocker, and began to wear green spectacles, but
gradually this defect became more pronounced, and on the 31st of May,
1669, he wrote the last words in his Diary:

     "And thus ends all that I doubt I shall ever be able to do with my
     own eyes in the keeping of my journal, I being not able to do it any
     longer, having done now as long as to undo my eyes almost every time
     that I take a pen in my hand."

He feared blindness and was forced to desist, to his lasting regret and
our great loss.

At this time he obtained leave of absence from the duties of his office,
and he set out on a tour through France and Holland accompanied by his
wife. In his travels he was true to the occupation of his life, and made
collections respecting the French and Dutch navies. Some months after
his return he spoke of his journey as having been "full of health and
content," but no sooner had he and his wife returned to London than the
latter became seriously ill with a fever. The disease took a fatal turn,
and on the 10th of November, 1669, Elizabeth Pepys died at the early
age of twenty-nine years, to the great grief of her husband. She died
at their house in Crutched Friars, and was buried at St. Olave's Church,
Hart Street, where Pepys erected a monument to her memory.

Pepys's successful speech at the bar of the House of Commons made
him anxious to become a member, and the Duke of York and Sir William
Coventry heartily supported him in his resolution. An opening occurred
in due course, at Aldborough, in Suffolk, owing to the death of Sir
Robert Brooke in 1669, but, in consequence of the death of his wife,
Pepys was unable to take part in the election. His cause was warmly
espoused by the Duke of York and by Lord Henry Howard (afterwards Earl
of Norwich and sixth Duke of Norfolk), but the efforts of his supporters
failed, and the contest ended in favour of John Bruce, who represented
the popular party. In November, 1673, Pepys was more successful, and
was elected for Castle Rising on the elevation of the member, Sir Robert
Paston, to the peerage as Viscount Yarmouth. His unsuccessful opponent,
Mr. Offley, petitioned against the return, and the election was
determined to be void by the Committee of Privileges. The Parliament,
however, being prorogued the following month without the House's coming
to any vote on the subject, Pepys was permitted to retain his seat. A
most irrelevant matter was introduced into the inquiry, and Pepys was
charged with having a crucifix in his house, from which it was inferred
that he was "a papist or popishly inclined." The charge was grounded
upon reported assertions of Sir John Banks and the Earl of Shaftesbury,
which they did not stand to when examined on the subject, and the charge
was not proved to be good.

     ["The House then proceeding upon the debate touching the Election
     for Castle Rising, between Mr. Pepys and Mr. Offley, did, in the
     first place, take into consideration what related personally to Mr.
     Pepys.  Information being given to the House that they had received
     an account from a person of quality, that he saw an Altar with a
     Crucifix upon it, in the house of Mr. Pepys; Mr. Pepys, standing up
     in his place, did heartily and flatly deny that he ever had any
     Altar or Crucifix, or the image or picture of any Saint whatsoever
     in his house, from the top to the bottom of it; and the Members
     being called upon to name the person that gave them the information,
     they were unwilling to declare it without the order of the House;
     which, being made, they named the Earl of Shaftesbury; and the House
     being also informed that Sir J. Banks did likewise see the Altar, he
     was ordered to attend the Bar of the House, to declare what he knew
     of this matter.  'Ordered that Sir William Coventry, Sir Thomas
     Meeres, and Mr. Garraway do attend Lord Shaftesbury on the like
     occasion, and receive what information his Lordship, can give on
     this matter.'"--Journals of the House of Commons, vol. ix., p.
     306.--" 13th February, Sir W. Coventry reports that they attended
     the Earl of Shaftesbury, and received from him the account which
     they had put in writing.  The Earl of Shaftesbury denieth that he
     ever saw an Altar in Mr. Pepys's house or lodgings; as to the
     Crucifix, he saith he hath, some imperfect memory of seeing somewhat
     which he conceived to be a Crucifix.  When his Lordship was asked
     the time, he said it was before the burning of the Office of the
     Navy.  Being asked concerning the manner, he said he could not
     remember whether it were painted or carved, or in what manner the
     thing was; and that his memory was so very imperfect in it, that if
     he were upon his oath he could give no testimony."--.  Ibid., vol.
     ix., p. 309.--" 16th February--Sir John Banks was called in--The
     Speaker desired him to answer what acquaintance he had with; Mr.
     Pepys, and whether he used to have recourse to him to his house and
     had ever seen there any Altar or Crucifix, or whether he knew of his
     being a Papist, or Popishly inclined.  Sir J. Banks said that he had
     known and had been acquainted with Mr. Pepys several years, and had
     often visited him and conversed with him at the Navy Office, and at
     his house there upon several occasions, and that he never saw in his
     house there any Altar or Crucifix, and that he does not believe him
     to be a Papist, or that way inclined in the least, nor had any
     reason or ground to think or believe it."--Ibid., vol, ix., p. 310.]

It will be seen from the extracts from the Journals of the House of
Commons given in the note that Pepys denied ever having had an altar or
crucifix in his house. In the Diary there is a distinct statement of
his possession of a crucifix, but it is not clear from the following
extracts whether it was not merely a varnished engraving of the
Crucifixion which he possessed:

     July 20, 1666.  "So I away to Lovett's, there to see how my picture
     goes on to be varnished, a fine crucifix which will be very fine."
     August 2. "At home find Lovett, who showed me my crucifix, which
     will be very fine when done."  Nov. 3.  "This morning comes Mr.
     Lovett and brings me my print of the Passion, varnished by him, and
     the frame which is indeed very fine, though not so fine as I
     expected; but pleases me exceedingly."

Whether he had or had not a crucifix in his house was a matter for
himself alone, and the interference of the House of Commons was a gross
violation of the liberty of the subject.

In connection with Lord Shaftesbury's part in this matter, the late Mr.
W. D. Christie found the following letter to Sir Thomas Meres among the
papers at St. Giles's House, Dorsetshire:--

                              "Exeter House, February 10th, 1674.

     "Sir,--That there might be no mistake, I thought best to put my
     answer in writing to those questions that yourself, Sir William
     Coventry, and Mr. Garroway were pleased to propose to me this
     morning from the House of Commons, which is that I never designed to
     be a witness against any man for what I either heard or saw, and
     therefore did not take so exact notice of things inquired of as to
     be able to remember them so clearly as is requisite to do in a
     testimony upon honour or oath, or to so great and honourable a body
     as the House of Commons, it being some years distance since I was at
     Mr. Pepys his lodging.  Only that particular of an altar is so
     signal that I must needs have remembered it had I seen any such
     thing, which I am sure I do not.  This I desire you to communicate
     with Sir William Coventry and Mr. Garroway to be delivered as my
     answer to the House of Commons, it being the same I gave you this
     morning.

               "I am, Sir,
                         "Your most humble servant,
                                             "SHAFTESBURY."

After reading this letter Sir William Coventry very justly remarked,
"There are a great many more Catholics than think themselves so, if
having a crucifix will make one." Mr. Christie resented the remarks
on Lord Shaftesbury's part in this persecution of Pepys made by Lord
Braybrooke, who said, "Painful indeed is it to reflect to what length
the bad passions which party violence inflames could in those days
carry a man of Shaftesbury's rank, station, and abilities." Mr. Christie
observes, "It is clear from the letter to Meres that Shaftesbury showed
no malice and much scrupulousness when a formal charge, involving
important results, was founded on his loose private conversations." This
would be a fair vindication if the above attack upon Pepys stood alone,
but we shall see later on that Shaftesbury was the moving spirit in a
still more unjustifiable attack.

Lord Sandwich died heroically in the naval action in Southwold Bay, and
on June 24th,1672, his remains were buried with some pomp in Westminster
Abbey. There were eleven earls among the mourners, and Pepys, as the
first among "the six Bannerolles," walked in the procession.

About this time Pepys was called from his old post of Clerk of the
Acts to the higher office of Secretary of the Admiralty. His first
appointment was a piece of favouritism, but it was due to his merits
alone that he obtained the secretaryship. In the summer of 1673, the
Duke of York having resigned all his appointments on the passing of
the Test Act, the King put the Admiralty into commission, and Pepys was
appointed Secretary for the Affairs of the Navy.

     [The office generally known as Secretary of the Admiralty dates back
     many years, but the officer who filled it was sometimes Secretary to
     the Lord High Admiral, and sometimes to the Commission for that
     office.  "His Majesties Letters Patent for ye erecting the office of
     Secretary of ye Admiralty of England, and creating Samuel Pepys,
     Esq., first Secretary therein," is dated June 10th, 1684.]

He was thus brought into more intimate connection with Charles II., who
took the deepest interest in shipbuilding and all naval affairs. The
Duke of Buckingham said of the King:--

     "The great, almost the only pleasure of his mind to which he seemed
     addicted was shipping and sea affairs, which seemed to be so much
     his talent for knowledge as well as inclination, that a war of that
     kind was rather an entertainment than any disturbance to his
     thoughts."

When Pepys ceased to be Clerk of the Acts he was able to obtain the
appointment for his clerk, Thomas Hayter, and his brother, John Pepys,
who held it jointly. The latter does not appear to have done much credit
to Samuel. He was appointed Clerk to the Trinity House in 1670 on his
brother's recommendation, and when he died in 1677 he was in debt L300
to his employers, and this sum Samuel had to pay. In 1676 Pepys was
Master of the Trinity House, and in the following year Master of the
Clothworkers' Company, when he presented a richly-chased silver cup,
which is still used at the banquets of the company. On Tuesday, 10th
September, 1677, the Feast of the Hon. Artillery Company was held at
Merchant Taylors' Hall, when the Duke of York, the Duke of Somerset, the
Lord Chancellor, and other distinguished persons were present. On this
occasion Viscount Newport, Sir Joseph Williamson, and Samuel Pepys
officiated as stewards.

About this time it is evident that the secretary carried himself with
some haughtiness as a ruler of the navy, and that this was resented by
some. An amusing instance will be found in the Parliamentary Debates.
On May 11th, 1678, the King's verbal message to quicken the supply was
brought in by Mr. Secretary Williamson, when Pepys spoke to this effect:

     "When I promised that the ships should be ready by the 30th of May,
     it was upon the supposition of the money for 90 ships proposed by
     the King and voted by you, their sizes and rates, and I doubt not by
     that time to have 90 ships, and if they fall short it will be only
     from the failing of the Streights ships coming home and those but
     two.....

     "Sir Robert Howard then rose and said, 'Pepys here speaks rather
     like an Admiral than a Secretary, "I" and "we."  I wish he knows
     half as much of the Navy as he pretends.'"

Pepys was chosen by the electors of Harwich as their member in the short
Parliament that sat from March to July, 1679, his colleague being Sir
Anthony Deane, but both members were sent to the Tower in May on a
baseless charge, and they were superseded in the next Parliament that
met on the 17th October, 1679.

The high-handed treatment which Pepys underwent at this time exhibits
a marked instance of the disgraceful persecution connected with the
so-called Popish plot. He was totally unconnected with the Roman
Catholic party, but his association with the Duke of York was sufficient
to mark him as a prey for the men who initiated this "Terror" of the
seventeenth century. Sir. Edmund Berry Godfrey came to his death in
October, 1678, and in December Samuel Atkins, Pepys's clerk, was brought
to trial as an accessory to his murder. Shaftesbury and the others not
having succeeded in getting at Pepys through his clerk, soon afterwards
attacked him more directly, using the infamous evidence of Colonel
Scott. Much light has lately been thrown upon the underhand dealings
of this miscreant by Mr. G. D. Scull, who printed privately in 1883 a
valuable work entitled, "Dorothea Scott, otherwise Gotherson, and Hogben
of Egerton House, Kent, 1611-1680."

John Scott (calling himself Colonel Scott) ingratiated himself into
acquaintance with Major Gotherson, and sold to the latter large tracts
of land in Long Island, to which he had no right whatever. Dorothea
Gotherson, after her husband's death, took steps to ascertain the exact
state of her property, and obtained the assistance of Colonel Francis
Lovelace, Governor of New York. Scott's fraud was discovered, and a
petition for redress was presented to the King. The result of this was
that the Duke of York commanded Pepys to collect evidence against Scott,
and he accordingly brought together a great number of depositions and
information as to his dishonest proceedings in New England, Long Island,
Barbadoes, France, Holland, and England, and these papers are preserved
among the Rawlinson Manuscripts in the Bodleian. Scott had his revenge,
and accused Pepys of betraying the Navy by sending secret particulars
to the French Government, and of a design to dethrone the king and
extirpate the Protestant religion. Pepys and Sir Anthony Deane were
committed to the Tower under the Speaker's warrant on May 22nd, 1679,
and Pepys's place at the Admiralty was filled by the appointment of
Thomas Hayter. When the two prisoners were brought to the bar of the
King's Bench on the 2nd of June, the Attorney-General refused bail, but
subsequently they were allowed to find security for L30,000.

Pepys was put to great expense in collecting evidence against Scott and
obtaining witnesses to clear himself of the charges brought against
him. He employed his brother-in-law, Balthasar St. Michel, to
collect evidence in France, as he himself explains in a letter to the
Commissioners of the Navy:--

     "His Majesty of his gracious regard to me, and the justification of
     my innocence, was then pleased at my humble request to dispence with
     my said brother goeing (with ye shippe about that time designed for
     Tangier) and to give leave to his goeing into France (the scene of
     ye villannys then in practice against me), he being the only person
     whom (from his relation to me, together with his knowledge in the
     place and language, his knowne dilligence and particular affection
     towards mee) I could at that tyme and in soe greate a cause pitch
     on, for committing the care of this affaire of detecting the
     practice of my enemies there."

In the end Scott refused to acknowledge to the truth of his original
deposition, and the prisoners were relieved from their bail on February
12th, 1679-80. John James, a butler previously in Pepys's service,
confessed on his deathbed in 1680 that he had trumped up the whole story
relating to his former master's change of religion at the instigation of
Mr. William Harbord, M.P. for Thetford.

Pepys wrote on July 1st, 1680, to Mrs. Skinner:

     "I would not omit giving you the knowledge of my having at last
     obtained what with as much reason I might have expected a year ago,
     my full discharge from the bondage I have, from one villain's
     practice, so long lain under."

William Harbord, of Cadbury, co. Somerset, second son of Sir Charles
Harbord, whom he succeeded in 1682 as Surveyor. General of the Land
Revenues of the Crown, was Pepys's most persistent enemy. Several papers
referring to Harbord's conduct were found at Scott's lodging after his
flight, and are now preserved among the Rawlinson MSS. in the Bodleian.
One of these was the following memorandum, which shows pretty plainly
Pepys's opinion of Harbord:--

     "That about the time of Mr. Pepys's surrender of his employment of
     Secretary of the Admiralty, Capt. Russell and myself being in
     discourse about Mr. Pepys, Mr. Russell delivered himself in these or
     other words to this purport: That he thought it might be of
     advantage to both, if a good understanding were had between his
     brother Harbord and Mr. Pepys, asking me to propose it to Mr. Pepys,
     and he would to his brother, which I agreed to, and went immediately
     from him to Mr. Pepys, and telling him of this discourse, he gave me
     readily this answer in these very words: That he knew of no service
     Mr. Harbord could doe him, or if he could, he should be the last man
     in England he would receive any from."

     [William Harbord sat as M.P.  for Thetford in several parliaments.
     In 1689 he was chosen on the Privy Council, and in 1690 became Vice-
     Treasurer for Ireland.  He was appointed Ambassador to Turkey in
     1692, and died at Belgrade in July of that year.]

Besides Scott's dishonesty in his dealings with Major Gotherson, it
came out that he had cheated the States of Holland out of L7,000, in
consequence of which he was hanged in effigy at the Hague in 1672. In
1682 he fled from England to escape from the law, as he had been guilty
of wilful murder by killing George Butler, a hackney coachman, and he
reached Norway in safety, where he remained till 1696. In that year some
of his influential friends obtained a pardon for him from William III.,
and he returned to England.

In October, 1680, Pepys attended on Charles II. at Newmarket, and there
he took down from the King's own mouth the narrative of his Majesty's
escape from Worcester, which was first published in 1766 by Sir David
Dalrymple (Lord Hailes) from the MS., which now remains in the Pepysian
library both in shorthand and in longhand? It is creditable to Charles
II. and the Duke of York that both brothers highly appreciated the
abilities of Pepys, and availed themselves of his knowledge of naval
affairs.

In the following year there was some chance that Pepys might retire from
public affairs, and take upon himself the headship of one of the chief
Cambridge colleges. On the death of Sir Thomas Page, the Provost of
King's College, in August, 1681, Mr. S. Maryon, a Fellow of Clare
Hall, recommended Pepys to apply to the King for the appointment, being
assured that the royal mandate if obtained would secure his election. He
liked the idea, but replied that he believed Colonel Legge (afterwards
Lord Dartmouth) wanted to get the office for an old tutor. Nothing
further seems to have been done by Pepys, except that he promised if
he were chosen to give the whole profit of the first year, and at least
half of that of each succeeding year, to "be dedicated to the general
and public use of the college." In the end Dr. John Coplestone was
appointed to the post.

On May 22nd, 1681, the Rev. Dr. Milles, rector of St. Olave's, who is
so often mentioned in the Diary, gave Pepys a certificate as to his
attention to the services of the Church. It is not quite clear what was
the occasion of the certificate, but probably the Diarist wished to have
it ready in case of another attack upon him in respect to his tendency
towards the Church of Rome.

Early in 1682 Pepys accompanied the Duke of York to Scotland, and
narrowly escaped shipwreck by the way. Before letters could arrive
in London to tell of his safety, the news came of the wreck of the
"Gloucester" (the Duke's ship), and of the loss of many lives. His
friends' anxiety was relieved by the arrival of a letter which Pepys
wrote from Edinburgh to Hewer on May 8th, in which he detailed the
particulars of the adventure. The Duke invited him to go on board the
"Gloucester" frigate, but he preferred his own yacht (the "Catherine "),
in which he had more room, and in consequence of his resolution he saved
himself from the risk of drowning. On May 5th the frigate struck upon
the sand called "The Lemon and Oar," about sixteen leagues from the
mouth of the Humber. This was caused by the carelessness of the pilot,
to whom Pepys imputed "an obstinate over-weening in opposition to the
contrary opinions of Sir I. Berry, his master, mates, Col. Legg, the
Duke himself, and several others, concurring unanimously in not being
yet clear of the sands." The Duke and his party escaped, but numbers
were drowned in the sinking ship, and it is said that had the wreck
occurred two hours earlier, and the accompanying yachts been at the
distance they had previously been, not a soul would have escaped.

Pepys stayed in Edinburgh for a short time, and the Duke of York allowed
him to be present at two councils. He then visited; with Colonel George
Legge, some of the principal places in the neighbourhood, such as
Stirling, Linlithgow, Hamilton, and Glasgow. The latter place he
describes as "a very extraordinary town indeed for beauty and trade,
much superior to any in Scotland."

Pepys had now been out of office for some time, but he was soon to have
employment again. Tangier, which was acquired at the marriage of the
King to Katharine of Braganza, had long been an incumbrance, and it
was resolved at last to destroy the place. Colonel Legge (now Lord
Dartmouth) was in August, 1683, constituted Captain-General of his
Majesty's forces in Africa, and Governor of Tangier, and sent with a
fleet of about twenty sail to demolish and blow up the works, destroy
the harbour, and bring home the garrison. Pepys received the King's
commands to accompany Lord Dartmouth on his expedition, but the latter's
instructions were secret, and Pepys therefore did not know what had been
decided upon. He saw quite enough, however, to form a strong opinion of
the uselessness of the place to England. Lord Dartmouth carried out
his instructions thoroughly, and on March 29th, 1684, he and his party
(including Pepys) arrived in the English Channel.

The King himself now resumed the office of Lord High Admiral, and
appointed Pepys Secretary of the Admiralty, with a salary of L500 per
annum. In the Pepysian Library is the original patent, dated June
10th, 1684: "His Majesty's Letters Patent for ye erecting the office of
Secretary of ye Admiralty of England, and creating Samuel Pepys, Esq.,
first Secretary therein." In this office the Diarist remained until the
period of the Revolution, when his official career was concluded.

A very special honour was conferred upon Pepys in this year, when he was
elected President of the Royal Society in succession to Sir Cyril Wyche,
and he held the office for two years. Pepys had been admitted a fellow
of the society on February 15th, 1664-65, and from Birch's "History" we
find that in the following month he made a statement to the society:--

"Mr. Pepys gave an account of what information he had received from the
Master of the Jersey ship which had been in company with Major Holmes in
the Guinea voyage concerning the pendulum watches (March 15th, 1664-5)."

The records of the society show that he frequently made himself useful
by obtaining such information as might be required in his department.
After he retired from the presidency, he continued to entertain some of
the most distinguished members of the society on Saturday evenings at
his house in York Buildings. Evelyn expressed the strongest regret
when it was necessary to discontinue these meetings on account of the
infirmities of the host.

In 1685 Charles II. died, and was succeeded by James, Duke of York. From
his intimate association with James it might have been supposed that a
long period of official life was still before Pepys, but the new king's
bigotry and incapacity soon made this a practical impossibility. At
the coronation of James II. Pepys marched in the procession immediately
behind the king's canopy, as one of the sixteen barons of the Cinque
Ports.

In the year 1685 a new charter was granted to the Trinity Company, and
Pepys was named in it the first master, this being the second time that
he had held the office of master.

Evelyn specially refers to the event in his Diary, and mentions the
distinguished persons present at the dinner on July 20th.

It is evident that at this time Pepys was looked upon as a specially
influential man, and when a parliament was summoned to meet on May 19th,
1685, he was elected both for Harwich and for Sandwich. He chose to
serve for Harwich, and Sir Philip Parker was elected to fill his place
at Sandwich.

This parliament was dissolved by proclamation July 2nd, 1687, and on
August 24th the king declared in council that another parliament should
be summoned for November 27th, 1688, but great changes took place before
that date, and when the Convention Parliament was called together
in January and February, 1689-90, Pepys found no place in it. The
right-hand man of the exiled monarch was not likely to find favour in
the eyes of those who were now in possession. When the election for
Harwich came on, the electors refused to return him, and the streets
echoed to the cry of "No Tower men, no men out of the Tower!" They did
not wish to be represented in parliament by a disgraced official.

We have little or no information to guide us as to Pepys's proceedings
at the period of the Revolution. We know that James II. just before his
flight was sitting to Kneller for a portrait intended for the Secretary
to the Admiralty, and that Pepys acted in that office for the last time
on 20th February, 1688-89, but between those dates we know nothing of
the anxieties and troubles that he must have suffered. On the 9th March
an order was issued from the Commissioners of the Admiralty for him
to deliver up his books, &c., to Phineas Bowies, who superseded him as
secretary.

Pepys had many firm friends upon whom he could rely, but he had also
enemies who lost no opportunity of worrying him. On June 10th, 1690,
Evelyn has this entry in his Diary, which throws some light upon the
events of the time:--

     "Mr. Pepys read to me his Remonstrance, skewing with what malice and
     injustice he was suspected with Sir Anth. Deane about the timber of
     which the thirty ships were built by a late Act of Parliament, with
     the exceeding danger which the fleete would shortly be in, by reason
     of the tyranny and incompetency of those who now managed the
     Admiralty and affairs of the Navy, of which he gave an accurate
     state, and shew'd his greate ability."

On the 25th of this same month Pepys was committed to the Gatehouse at
Westminster on a charge of having sent information to the French Court
of the state of the English navy. There was no evidence of any kind
against him, and at the end of July he was allowed to return to his own
house on account of ill-health. Nothing further was done in respect to
the charge, but he was not free till some time after, and he was long
kept in anxiety, for even in 1692 he still apprehended some fresh
persecution.

Sir Peter Palavicini, Mr. James Houblon, Mr. Blackburne, and Mr. Martin
bailed him, and he sent them the following circular letter:--

                                             "October 15, 1690.

     "Being this day become once again a free man in every respect, I
     mean but that of my obligation to you and the rest of my friends, to
     whom I stand indebted for my being so, I think it but a reasonable
     part of my duty to pay you and them my thanks for it in a body; but
     know not how otherwise to compass it than by begging you, which I
     hereby do, to take your share with them and me here, to-morrow, of a
     piece of mutton, which is all I dare promise you, besides that of
     being ever,

               "Your most bounden and faithful humble servant,
                                                       "S. P."

He employed the enforced idleness caused by being thrust out of his
employment in the collection of the materials for the valuable work
which he published in 1690, under the title of "Memoirs of the Navy."
Little more was left for him to do in life, but as the government became
more firmly established, and the absolute absurdity of the idea of
his disloyalty was proved, Pepys held up his head again as a man to be
respected and consulted, and for the remainder of his life he was looked
upon as the Nestor of the Navy.

There is little more to be told of Pepys's life. He continued to keep
up an extended correspondence with his many friends, and as Treasurer
of Christ's Hospital he took very great interest in the welfare of
that institution. He succeeded in preserving from impending ruin the
mathematical foundation which had been originally designed by him, and
through his anxious solicitations endowed and cherished by Charles
II. and James II. One of the last public acts of his life was the
presentation of the portrait of the eminent Dr. John Wallis, Savilian
Professor of Geometry, to the University of Oxford.

In 1701 he sent Sir Godfrey Kneller to Oxford to paint the portrait, and
the University rewarded him with a Latin diploma containing in gorgeous
language the expression of thanks for his munificence.'

On the 26th May, 1703, Samuel Pepys, after long continued suffering,
breathed his last in the presence of the learned Dr. George Hickes, the
nonjuring Dean of Worcester, and the following letter from John Jackson
to his uncle's lifelong friend Evelyn contains particulars as to the
cause of death:

                       Mr.  Jackson to Mr. Evelyn.

                                        "Clapham, May 28th, 1703.
                                        "Friday night.

     "Honoured Sir,

     "'Tis no small addition to my grief, to be obliged to interrupt the
     quiet of your happy recess with the afflicting tidings of my Uncle
     Pepys's death: knowing how sensibly you will partake with me herein.
     But I should not be faithful to his desires, if I did not beg your
     doing the honour to his memory of accepting mourning from him, as a
     small instance of his most affectionate respect and honour for you.
     I have thought myself extremely unfortunate to be out of the way at
     that only time when you were pleased lately to touch here, and
     express so great a desire of taking your leave of my Uncle; which
     could not but have been admitted by him as a most welcome exception
     to his general orders against being interrupted; and I could most
     heartily wish that the circumstances of your health and distance did
     not forbid me to ask the favour of your assisting in the holding up
     of the pawll at his interment, which is intended to be on Thursday
     next; for if the manes are affected with what passes below, I am
     sure this would have been very grateful to his.

     "I must not omit acquainting you, sir, that upon opening his body,
     (which the uncommonness of his case required of us, for our own
     satisfaction as well as public good) there was found in his left
     kidney a nest of no less than seven stones, of the most irregular,
     figures your imagination can frame, and weighing together four
     ounces and a half, but all fast linked together, and adhering to his
     back; whereby they solve his having felt no greater pains upon
     motion, nor other of the ordinary symptoms of the stone.  Some other
     lesser defects there also were in his body, proceeding from the same
     cause.  But his stamina, in general, were marvellously strong, and
     not only supported him, under the most exquisite pains, weeks beyond
     all expectations; but, in the conclusion, contended for nearly forty
     hours (unassisted by any nourishment) with the very agonies of
     death, some few minutes excepted, before his expiring, which were
     very calm.

     "There remains only for me, under this affliction, to beg the
     consolation and honour of succeeding to your patronage, for my
     Uncle's sake; and leave to number myself, with the same sincerity he
     ever did, among your greatest honourers, which I shall esteem as one
     of the most valuable parts of my inheritances from him; being also,
     with the faithfullest wishes of health and a happy long life to you,

                    "Honoured Sir,
                         "Your most obedient and
                              "Most humble Servant,
                                        "J.  JACKSON.

     "Mr. Hewer, as my Uncle's Executor, and equally your faithful
     Servant, joins with me in every part hereof.

     "The time of my Uncle's departure was about three-quarters past
     three on Wednesday morning last."

Evelyn alludes in his Diary to Pepys's death and the present to him of a
suit of mourning. He speaks in very high terms of his friend:--

     "1703, May 26th.  This day died Mr. Sam Pepys, a very worthy,
     industrious, and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
     knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed thro' all the most
     considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the
     Admiralty, all which he performed with great integrity.  When K.
     James II.  went out of England, he laid down his office, and would
     serve no more, but withdrawing himselfe from all public affaires, he
     liv'd at Clapham with his partner Mr. Hewer, formerly his clerk, in
     a very noble and sweete place, where he enjoy'd the fruits of his
     labours in greate prosperity.  He was universally belov'd,
     hospitable, generous, learned in many things, skilfd in music, a
     very greate cherisher of learned men of whom he had the conversation
 ....  Mr. Pepys had been for neere 40 yeeres so much my
     particular friend that Mr. Jackson sent me compleat mourning,
     desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at his magnificent
     obsequies, but my indisposition hinder'd me from doing him this last
     office."

The body was brought from Clapham and buried in St. Olave's Church,
Hart Street, on the 5th June, at nine o'clock at night, in a vault just
beneath the monument to the memory of Mrs. Pepys. Dr. Hickes performed
the last sad offices for his friend.

Pepys's faithful friend, Hewer, was his executor, and his nephew, John
Jackson, his heir. Mourning was presented to forty persons, and a large
number of rings to relations, godchildren, servants, and friends,
also to representatives of the Royal Society, of the Universities of
Cambridge and Oxford, of the Admiralty, and of the Navy Office. The bulk
of the property was bequeathed to Jackson, but the money which was left
was much less than might have been expected, for at the time of Pepys's
death there was a balance of L28,007 2s. 1d. due to him from the Crown,
and none of this was ever paid. The books and other collections were
left to Magdalene College, Cambridge, but Jackson was to have possession
of them during his lifetime. These were the most important portion of
Pepys's effects, for with them was the manuscript of the immortal Diary.
The following are the directions for the disposition of the library,
taken from Harl. MS., No. 7301:

     "For the further settlement and preservation of my said library,
     after the death of my nephew.  John Jackson, I do hereby declare,
     That could I be sure of a constant succession of heirs from my said
     nephew, qualified like himself for the use of such a library, I
     should not entertain a thought of its ever being alienated from
     them.  But this uncertainty considered, with the infinite pains, and
     time, and cost employed in my collecting, methodising and reducing
     the same to the state it now is, I cannot but be greatly solicitous
     that all possible provision should be made for its unalterable
     preservation and perpetual security against the ordinary fate of
     such collections falling into the hands of an incompetent heir, and
     thereby being sold, dissipated, or embezzled.  And since it has
     pleased God to visit me in a manner that leaves little appearance of
     being myself restored to a condition of concerting the necessary
     measures for attaining these ends, I must and do with great
     confidence rely upon the sincerity and direction of my executor and
     said nephew for putting in execution the powers given them, by my
     forementioned will relating hereto, requiring that the same be
     brought to a determination in twelve months after my decease, and
     that special regard be had therein to the following particulars
     which I declare to be my present thoughts and prevailing
     inclinations in this matter, viz.:

     "1.  That after the death of my said nephew, my said library be
     placed and for ever settled in one of our universities, and rather
     in that of Cambridge than Oxford.

     "2.  And rather in a private college there, than in the public
     library.

     "3.  And in the colleges of Trinity or Magdalen preferably to all
     others.

     "4.  And of these too, 'caeteris paribus', rather in the latter, for
     the sake of my own and my nephew's education therein.

     "5.  That in which soever of the two it is, a fair roome be provided
     therein.

     "6.  And if in Trinity, that the said roome be contiguous to, and
     have communication with, the new library there.

     "7.  And if in Magdalen, that it be in the new building there, and
     any part thereof at my nephew's election.

     "8.  That my said library be continued in its present form and no
     other books mixed therein, save what my nephew may add to theirs of
     his own collecting, in distinct presses.

     "9.  That the said room and books so placed and adjusted be called
     by the name of 'Bibliotheca Pepysiana.'

     "10.  That this 'Bibliotheca Pepysiana' be under the sole power and
     custody of the master of the college for the time being, who shall
     neither himself convey, nor suffer to be conveyed by others, any of
     the said books from thence to any other place, except to his own
     lodge in the said college, nor there have more than ten of them at a
     time; and that of those also a strict entry be made and account
     kept, at the time of their having been taken out and returned, in a
     book to be provided, and remain in the said library for that purpose
     only.

     "11.  That before my said library be put into the possession of
     either of the said colleges, that college for which it shall be
     designed, first enter into covenants for performance of the
     foregoing articles.

     "12.  And that for a yet further security herein, the said two
     colleges of Trinity and Magdalen have a reciprocal check upon one
     another; and that college which shall be in present possession of
     the said library, be subject to an annual visitation from the other,
     and to the forfeiture thereof to the life, possession, and use of
     the other, upon conviction of any breach of their said covenants.

                                                  "S. PEPYS."

The library and the original book-cases were not transferred to
Magdalene College until 1724, and there they have been preserved in
safety ever since.

A large number of Pepys's manuscripts appear to have remained unnoticed
in York Buildings for some years. They never came into Jackson's hands,
and were thus lost to Magdalene College. Dr. Rawlinson afterwards
obtained them, and they were included in the bequest of his books to the
Bodleian Library.

Pepys was partial to having his portrait taken, and he sat to Savill,
Hales, Lely, and Kneller. Hales's portrait, painted in 1666, is now in
the National Portrait Gallery, and an etching from the original forms
the frontispiece to this volume. The portrait by Lely is in the Pepysian
Library. Of the three portraits by Kneller, one is in the hall of
Magdalene College, another at the Royal Society, and the third was lent
to the First Special Exhibition of National Portraits, 1866, by the late
Mr. Andrew Pepys Cockerell. Several of the portraits have been engraved,
but the most interesting of these are those used by Pepys himself as
book-plates. These were both engraved by Robert White, and taken from
paintings by Kneller.

The church of St. Olave, Hart Street, is intimately associated with
Pepys both in his life and in his death, and for many years the question
had been constantly asked by visitors, "Where is Pepys's monument?"
On Wednesday, July 5th, 1882, a meeting was held in the vestry of the
church, when an influential committee was appointed, upon which all the
great institutions with which Pepys was connected were represented by
their masters, presidents, or other officers, with the object of taking
steps to obtain an adequate memorial of the Diarist. Mr. (now Sir)
Alfred Blomfield, architect of the church, presented an appropriate
design for a monument, and sufficient subscriptions having been obtained
for the purpose, he superintended its erection. On Tuesday afternoon,
March 18th, 1884, the monument, which was affixed to the wall of the
church where the gallery containing Pepys's pew formerly stood, was
unveiled in the presence of a large concourse of visitors. The Earl
of Northbrook, First Lord of the Admiralty, consented to unveil the
monument, but he was at the last moment prevented by public business
from attending. The late Mr. Russell Lowell, then the American Minister,
took Lord Northbrook's place, and made a very charming and appreciative
speech on the occasion, from which the following passages are
extracted:--

     "It was proper," his Excellency said, "that he should read a note he
     had received from Lord Northbrook.  This was dated that day from the
     Admiralty, and was as follows:

     "'My dear Mr. Lowell,

     "'I am very much annoyed that I am prevented from assisting at the
     ceremony to-day.  It would be very good if you would say that
     nothing but very urgent business would have kept me away.  I was
     anxious to give my testimony to the merits of Pepys as an Admiralty
     official, leaving his literary merits to you.  He was concerned with
     the administration of the Navy from the Restoration to the
     Revolution, and from 1673 as secretary.  I believe his merits to be
     fairly stated in a contemporary account, which I send.

                         "'Yours very truly,
                                        "'NORTHBROOK.

     "The contemporary account, which Lord Northbrook was good enough to
     send him, said:

     "'Pepys was, without exception, the greatest and most useful
     Minister that ever filled the same situations in England, the acts
     and registers of the Admiralty proving this beyond contradiction.
     The principal rules and establishments in present use in these
     offices are well known to have been of his introducing, and most of
     the officers serving therein since the Restoration, of his bringing-
     up.  He was a most studious promoter and strenuous asserter of order
     and discipline.  Sobriety, diligence, capacity, loyalty, and
     subjection to command were essentials required in all whom he
     advanced.  Where any of these were found wanting, no interest or
     authority was capable of moving him in favour of the highest
     pretender.  Discharging his duty to his Prince and country with a
     religious application and perfect integrity, he feared no one,
     courted no one, and neglected his own fortune.'

     "That was a character drawn, it was true, by a friendly hand, but to
     those who were familiar with the life of Pepys, the praise hardly
     seemed exaggerated.  As regarded his official life, it was
     unnecessary to dilate upon his peculiar merits, for they all knew
     how faithful he was in his duties, and they all knew, too, how many
     faithful officials there were working on in obscurity, who were not
     only never honoured with a monument but who never expected one.  The
     few words, Mr. Lowell went on to remark, which he was expected to
     say upon that occasion, therefore, referred rather to what he
     believed was the true motive which had brought that assembly
     together, and that was by no means the character of Pepys either as
     Clerk of the Acts or as Secretary to the Admiralty.  This was not
     the place in which one could go into a very close examination of the
     character of Pepys as a private man.  He would begin by admitting
     that Pepys was a type, perhaps, of what was now called a
     'Philistine'.  We had no word in England which was equivalent to the
     French adjective Bourgeois; but, at all events, Samuel Pepys was the
     most perfect type that ever existed of the class of people whom this
     word described.  He had all its merits as well as many of its
     defects.  With all those defects, however perhaps in consequence of
     them--Pepys had written one of the most delightful books that it was
     man's privilege to read in the English language or in any other.
     Whether Pepys intended this Diary to be afterwards read by the
     general public or not--and this was a doubtful question when it was
     considered that he had left, possibly by inadvertence, a key to his
     cypher behind him--it was certain that he had left with us a most
     delightful picture, or rather he had left the power in our hands of
     drawing for ourselves some, of the most delightful pictures, of the
     time in which he lived.  There was hardly any book which was
     analogous to it.....  If one were asked what were the reasons
     for liking Pepys, it would be found that they were as numerous as
     the days upon which he made an entry in his Diary, and surely that
     was sufficient argument in his favour.  There was no book, Mr.
     Lowell said, that he knew of, or that occurred to his memory, with
     which Pepys's Diary could fairly be compared, except the journal of
     L'Estoile, who had the same anxious curiosity and the same
     commonness, not to say vulgarity of interest, and the book was
     certainly unique in one respect, and that was the absolute sincerity
     of the author with himself.  Montaigne is conscious that we are
     looking over his shoulder, and Rousseau secretive in comparison with
     him.  The very fact of that sincerity of the author with himself
     argued a certain greatness of character.  Dr. Hickes, who attended
     Pepys at his deathbed, spoke of him as 'this great man,' and said he
     knew no one who died so greatly.  And yet there was something almost
     of the ridiculous in the statement when the 'greatness' was compared
     with the garrulous frankness which Pepys showed towards himself.
     There was no parallel to the character of Pepys, he believed, in
     respect of 'naivete', unless it were found in that of Falstaff, and
     Pepys showed himself, too, like Falstaff, on terms of unbuttoned
     familiarity with himself.  Falstaff had just the same 'naivete', but
     in Falstaff it was the 'naivete' of conscious humour.  In Pepys it
     was quite different, for Pepys's 'naivete' was the inoffensive
     vanity of a man who loved to see himself in the glass.  Falstaff had
     a sense, too, of inadvertent humour, but it was questionable whether
     Pepys could have had any sense of humour at all, and yet permitted
     himself to be so delightful.  There was probably, however, more
     involuntary humour in Pepys's Diary than there was in any other book
     extant.  When he told his readers of the landing of Charles II. at
     Dover, for instance, it would be remembered how Pepys chronicled the
     fact that the Mayor of Dover presented the Prince with a Bible, for
     which he returned his thanks and said it was the 'most precious Book
     to him in the world.'  Then, again, it would be remembered how, when
     he received a letter addressed 'Samuel Pepys, Esq.,' he confesses in
     the Diary that this pleased him mightily.  When, too, he kicked his
     cookmaid, he admits that he was not sorry for it, but was sorry that
     the footboy of a worthy knight with whom he was acquainted saw him
     do it.  And the last instance he would mention of poor Pepys's
     'naivete' was when he said in the Diary that he could not help
     having a certain pleasant and satisfied feeling when Barlow died.
     Barlow, it must be remembered, received during his life the yearly
     sum from Pepys of L100.  The value of Pepys's book was simply
     priceless, and while there was nothing in it approaching that single
     page in St. Simon where he described that thunder of courtierly red
     heels passing from one wing of the Palace to another as the Prince
     was lying on his death-bed, and favour was to flow from another
     source, still Pepys's Diary was unequalled in its peculiar quality
     of amusement.  The lightest part of the Diary was of value,
     historically, for it enabled one to see London of 200 years ago,
     and, what was more, to see it with the eager eyes of Pepys.  It was
     not Pepys the official who had brought that large gathering together
     that day in honour of his memory: it was Pepys the Diarist."

In concluding this account of the chief particulars of Pepys's life
it may be well to add a few words upon the pronunciation of his
name. Various attempts appear to have been made to represent this
phonetically. Lord Braybrooke, in quoting the entry of death from
St. Olave's Registers, where the spelling is "Peyps," wrote, "This is
decisive as to the proper pronunciation of the name." This spelling may
show that the name was pronounced as a monosyllable, but it is scarcely
conclusive as to anything else, and Lord Braybrooke does not say what
he supposes the sound of the vowels to have been. At present there are
three pronunciations in use--Peps, which is the most usual; Peeps, which
is the received one at Magdalene College, and Peppis, which I learn from
Mr. Walter C. Pepys is the one used by other branches of the family. Mr.
Pepys has paid particular attention to this point, and in his valuable
"Genealogy of the Pepys Family" (1887) he has collected seventeen
varieties of spelling of the name, which are as follows, the dates of
the documents in which the form appears being attached:

1. Pepis (1273); 2. Pepy (1439); 3. Pypys (1511); 4. Pipes (1511); 5.
Peppis (1518); 6. Peppes (1519); 7. Pepes (1520); 8. Peppys (1552); 9.
Peaps (1636); 10. Pippis (1639); 11. Peapys (1653); 12. Peps (1655); 13.
Pypes (1656); 14. Peypes (1656); 15. Peeps (1679); 16. Peepes (1683);
17. Peyps (1703). Mr. Walter Pepys adds:--

     "The accepted spelling of the name 'Pepys' was adopted generally
     about the end of the seventeenth century, though it occurs many
     years before that time.  There have been numerous ways of
     pronouncing the name, as 'Peps,' 'Peeps,' and 'Peppis.'  The
     Diarist undoubtedly pronounced it 'Peeps,' and the lineal
     descendants of his sister Paulina, the family of 'Pepys Cockerell'
     pronounce it so to this day.  The other branches of the family all
     pronounce it as 'Peppis,' and I am led to be satisfied that the
     latter pronunciation is correct by the two facts that in the
     earliest known writing it is spelt 'Pepis,' and that the French form
     of the name is 'Pepy.'"

The most probable explanation is that the name in the seventeenth
century was either pronounced 'Pips' or 'Papes'; for both the forms 'ea'
and 'ey' would represent the latter pronunciation. The general change in
the pronunciation of the spelling 'ea' from 'ai' to 'ee' took place in a
large number of words at the end of the seventeenth and beginning of
the eighteenth-century, and three words at least (yea, break, and great)
keep this old pronunciation still. The present Irish pronunciation
of English is really the same as the English pronunciation of the
seventeenth century, when the most extensive settlement of Englishmen
in Ireland took place, and the Irish always pronounce ea like ai (as,
He gave him a nate bating--neat beating). Again, the 'ey' of Peyps would
rhyme with they and obey. English literature is full of illustrations of
the old pronunciation of ea, as in "Hudibras;"

              "Doubtless the pleasure is as great
               In being cheated as to cheat,"

which was then a perfect rhyme. In the "Rape of the Lock" tea (tay)
rhymes with obey, and in Cowper's verses on Alexander Selkirk sea rhymes
with survey.' It is not likely that the pronunciation of the name was
fixed, but there is every reason to suppose that the spellings of Peyps
and Peaps were intended to represent the sound Pepes rather than Peeps.

In spite of all the research which has brought to light so many
incidents of interest in the life of Samuel Pepys, we cannot but feel
how dry these facts are when placed by the side of the living details of
the Diary. It is in its pages that the true man is displayed, and it has
therefore not been thought necessary here to do more than set down in
chronological order such facts as are known of the life outside the
Diary. A fuller "appreciation" of the man must be left for some future
occasion.

JANUARY 1659-1660

     [The year did not legally begin in England before the 25th March
     until the act for altering the style fixed the 1st of January as the
     first day of the year, and previous to 1752 the year extended from
     March 25th to the following March 24th.  Thus since 1752 we have
     been in the habit of putting the two dates for the months of January
     and February and March 1 to 24--in all years previous to 1752.
     Practically, however, many persons considered the year to commence
     with January 1st, as it will be seen Pepys did.  The 1st of January
     was considered as New Year's day long before Pepys's time.  The
     fiscal year has not been altered; and the national accounts are
     still reckoned from old Lady Day, which falls on the 6th of April.]

Blessed be God, at the end of the last year I was in very good health,
without any sense of my old pain, but upon taking of cold.

     [Pepys was successfully cut for the stone on March 26th, 1658.  See
     March 26th below.  Although not suffering from this cause again
     until the end of his life, there are frequent references in the
     Diary to pain whenever he caught cold.  In a letter from Pepys to
     his nephew Jackson, April 8th, 1700, there is a reference to the
     breaking out three years before his death of the wound caused by the
     cutting for the stone: "It has been my calamity for much the
     greatest part of this time to have been kept bedrid, under an evil
     so rarely known as to have had it matter of universal surprise and
     with little less general opinion of its dangerousness; namely, that
     the cicatrice of a wound occasioned upon my cutting for the stone,
     without hearing anything of it in all this time, should after more
     than 40 years' perfect cure, break out again."  At the post-mortem
     examination a nest of seven stones, weighing four and a half ounces,
     was found in the left kidney, which was entirely ulcerated.]

I lived in Axe Yard,

     [Pepys's house was on the south side of King Street, Westminster;
     it is singular that when he removed to a residence in the city, he
     should have settled close to another Axe Yard.  Fludyer Street
     stands on the site of Axe Yard, which derived its name from a great
     messuage or brewhouse on the west side of King Street, called "The
     Axe," and referred to in a document of the 23rd of Henry VIII--B.]

My wife.... gave me hopes of her being with child, but on the last day
of the year....[the hope was belied.]

[Ed. note:.... are used to denote censored passages]

The condition of the State was thus; viz. the Rump, after being
disturbed by my Lord Lambert,

     [John Lambert, major-general in the Parliamentary army.  The title
     Lord was not his by right, but it was frequently given to the
     republican officers.  He was born in 1619, at Calton Hall, in the
     parish of Kirkby-in-Malham-Dale, in the West Riding of Yorkshire.
     In 1642 he was appointed captain of horse under Fairfax, and acted
     as major-general to Cromwell in 1650 during the war in Scotland.
     After this Parliament conferred on him a grant of lands in Scotland
     worth L1000 per annum.  He refused to take the oath of allegiance to
     Cromwell, for which the Protector deprived him of his commission.
     After Cromwell's death he tried to set up a military government.
     The Commons cashiered Lambert, Desborough, and other officers,
     October 12th, 1659, but Lambert retaliated by thrusting out the
     Commons, and set out to meet Monk.  His men fell away from him, and
     he was sent to the Tower, March 3rd, 1660, but escaped.  In 1662 he
     was tried on a charge of high treason and condemned, but his life
     was spared.  It is generally stated that he passed the remainder of
     his life in the island of Guernsey, but this is proved to be
     incorrect by a MS. in the Plymouth Athenaeum, entitled "Plimmouth
     Memoirs collected by James Yonge, 1684" This will be seen from the
     following extracts quoted by Mr. R. J. King, in "Notes and Queries,"
     "1667 Lambert the arch-rebel brought to this island [St. Nicholas,
     at the entrance of Plymouth harbour]."  "1683 Easter day Lambert
     that olde rebell dyed this winter on Plimmouth Island where he had
     been prisoner 15 years and more."]

yield. Lawson

     [Sir John Lawson, the son of a poor man at Hull, entered the navy as
     a common sailor, rose to the rank of admiral, and distinguished
     himself during the Protectorate.  Though a republican, he readily
     closed with the design of restoring the King.  He was vice-admiral
     under the Earl of Sandwich, and commanded the "London" in the
     squadron which conveyed Charles II. to England.  He was mortally
     wounded in the action with the Dutch off Harwich, June, 1665.  He
     must not be confounded with another John Lawson, the Royalist, of
     Brough Hall, in Yorkshire, who was created a Baronet by Charles II,
     July 6th, 1665.]

of Albemarle, 1660, married Ann Clarges, March, 1654, died January 3rd,
1676.]--is with his army in Scotland. Only my Lord Lambert is not yet
come into the Parliament, nor is it expected that he will without being
forced to it. The new Common Council of the City do speak very high; and
had sent to Monk their sword-bearer, to acquaint him with their desires
for a free and full Parliament, which is at present the desires, and the
hopes, and expectation of all. Twenty-two of the old secluded members

     ["The City sent and invited him [Monk] to dine the next day at
     Guildhall, and there he declared for the members whom the army had
     forced away in year forty-seven and forty-eight, who were known by
     the names of secluded members."--Burnet's Hist. of his Own Time,
     book i.]

having been at the House-door the last week to demand entrance, but it
was denied them; and it is believed that [neither] they nor the people
will be satisfied till the House be filled. My own private condition
very handsome, and esteemed rich, but indeed very poor; besides my goods
of my house, and my office, which at present is somewhat uncertain. Mr.
Downing master of my office.

     [George Downing was one of the Four Tellers of the Receipt of the
     Exchequer, and in his office Pepys was a clerk.  He was the son of
     Emmanuel Downing of the Inner Temple, afterwards of Salem,
     Massachusetts, and of Lucy, sister of Governor John Winthrop.  He is
     supposed to have been born in August, 1623.  He and his parents went
     to New England in 1638, and he was the second graduate of Harvard
     College.  He returned to England about 1645, and acted as Colonel
     Okey's chaplain before he entered into political life.  Anthony a
     Wood (who incorrectly describes him as the son of Dr. Calybute
     Downing, vicar of Hackney) calls Downing a sider with all times and
     changes: skilled in the common cant, and a preacher occasionally.
     He was sent by Cromwell to Holland in 1657, as resident there.  At
     the Restoration, he espoused the King's cause, and was knighted and
     elected M.P. for Morpeth, in 1661.  Afterwards, becoming
     Secretary to the Treasury and Commissioner of the Customs, he was in
     1663 created a Baronet of East Hatley, in Cambridgeshire, and was
     again sent Ambassador to Holland.  His grandson of the same name,
     who died in 1749, was the founder of Downing College, Cambridge.
     The title became extinct in 1764, upon the decease of Sir John
     Gerrard Downing, the last heir-male of the family.  Sir George
     Downing's character will be found in Lord Clarendon's "Life," vol.
     iii.  p. 4.  Pepys's opinion seems to be somewhat of a mixed kind.
     He died in July, 1684.]

Jan. 1st (Lord's day). This morning (we living lately in the garret,)
I rose, put on my suit with great skirts, having not lately worn any
other, clothes but them. Went to Mr. Gunning's

     [Peter Gunning, afterwards Master of St. John's College, Cambridge,
     and successively Bishop of Chichester and Ely.  He had continued to
     read the Liturgy at the chapel at Exeter House when the Parliament
     was most predominant, for which Cromwell often rebuked him.  Evelyn
     relates that on Christmas Day, 1657, the chapel was surrounded with
     soldiers, and the congregation taken prisoners, he and his wife
     being among them.  There are several notices of Dr. Gunning in
     Evelyn's Diary.  When he obtained the mastership of St. John's
     College upon the ejection of Dr. Tuckney, he allowed that
     Nonconformist divine a handsome annuity during his life.  He was a
     great controversialist, and a man of great reading.  Burnet says he
     "was a very honest sincere man, but of no sound judgment, and of no
     prudence in affairs" ("Hist. of his Own.  Time").  He died July 6th,
     1684, aged seventy-one.]

chapel at Exeter House, where he made a very good sermon upon these
words:--"That in the fulness of time God sent his Son, made of a woman,"
&c.; showing, that, by "made under the law," is meant his circumcision,
which is solemnized this day. Dined at home in the garret, where my wife
dressed the remains of a turkey, and in the doing of it she burned her
hand. I staid at home all the afternoon, looking over my accounts; then
went with my wife to my father's, and in going observed the great posts
which the City have set up at the Conduit in Fleet-street. Supt at my
father's, where in came Mrs. The. Turner--[Theophila Turner, daughter of
Sergeant John and Jane Turner, who married Sir Arthur Harris, Bart. She
died 1686.]--and Madam Morrice, and supt with us. After that my wife and
I went home with them, and so to our own home.

2nd. In the morning before I went forth old East brought me a dozen of
bottles of sack, and I gave him a shilling for his pains. Then I went to
Mr. Sheply,--[Shepley was a servant of Admiral Sir Edward Montagu]--who
was drawing of sack in the wine cellar to send to other places as a gift
from my Lord, and told me that my Lord had given him order to give me
the dozen of bottles. Thence I went to the Temple to speak with Mr.
Calthropp about the L60 due to my Lord,

     [Sir Edward Montagu, born 1625, son of Sir Sidney Montagu, by
     Paulina, daughter of John Pepys of Cottenham, married Jemima,
     daughter of John Crew of Stene.  He died in action against the Dutch
     in Southwold Bay, May 28th, 1672.  The title of "My Lord" here
     applied to Montagu before he was created Earl of Sandwich is of the
     same character as that given to General Lambert.]

but missed of him, he being abroad. Then I went to Mr. Crew's

     [John Crew, born 1598, eldest son of Sir Thomas Crew, Sergeant-at-
     Law and Speaker of the House of Commons.  He sat for Brackley in the
     Long Parliament.  Created Baron Crew of Stene, in the county of
     Northampton, at the coronation of Charles II.  He married Jemima,
     daughter and co-heir of Edward Walgrave (or Waldegrave) of Lawford,
     Essex.  His house was in Lincoln's Inn Fields.  He died December
     12th, 1679.]

and borrowed L10 of Mr. Andrewes for my own use, and so went to my
office, where there was nothing to do. Then I walked a great while in
Westminster Hall, where I heard that Lambert was coming up to London;
that my Lord Fairfax

     [Thomas, Lord Fairfax, Generalissimo of the Parliament forces.
     After the Restoration, he retired to his country seat, where he
     lived in private till his death, 1671.  In a volume (autograph) of
     Lord Fairfax's Poems, preserved in the British Museum, 11744, f. 42,
     the following lines occur upon the 30th of January, on which day the
     King was beheaded.  It is believed that they have never been
     printed.

              "O let that day from time be bloted quitt,
               And beleef of 't in next age be waved,
               In depest silence that act concealed might,
               That so the creadet of our nation might be saved;
               But if the powre devine hath ordered this,
               His will's the law, and our must aquiess."

     These wretched verses have obviously no merit; but they are curious
     as showing that Fairfax, who had refused to act as one of Charles
     I's judges; continued long afterwards to entertain a proper horror
     for that unfortunate monarch's fate.  It has recently been pointed
     out to me, that the lines were not originally composed by Fairfax,
     being only a poor translation of the spirited lines of Statius
     (Sylvarum lib. v.  cap. ii.  l. 88)

              "Excidat illa dies aevo, ne postera credant
               Secula, nos certe taceamus; et obruta multa
               Nocte tegi propria patiamur crimina gentis."

     These verses were first applied by the President de Thou to the
     massacre of St. Bartholomew, 1572; and in our day, by Mr. Pitt, in
     his memorable speech in the House of Commons, January, 1793, after
     the murder of Louis XVI.--B.]

was in the head of the Irish brigade, but it was not certain what he
would declare for. The House was to-day upon finishing the act for the
Council of State, which they did; and for the indemnity to the soldiers;
and were to sit again thereupon in the afternoon. Great talk that many
places have declared for a free Parliament; and it is believed that they
will be forced to fill up the House with the old members. From the Hall
I called at home, and so went to Mr. Crew's (my wife she was to go to
her father's), thinking to have dined, but I came too late, so Mr. Moore
and I and another gentleman went out and drank a cup of ale together
in the new market, and there I eat some bread and cheese for my dinner.
After that Mr. Moore and I went as far as Fleet-street together and
parted, he going into the City, I to find Mr. Calthrop, but failed again
of finding him, so returned to Mr. Crew's again, and from thence went
along with Mrs. Jemimah

     [Mrs. Jemimah, or Mrs. Jem, was Jemima, eldest daughter of Sir
     Edward Montagu.  At this time she and her sister, Mrs. Ann, seem to
     have been living alone with their maids in London, and Pepys's duty
     was to look after them.]

home, and there she taught me how to play at cribbage. Then I went home,
and finding my wife gone to see Mrs. Hunt, I went to Will's,

     [Pepys constantly visited "Will's" about this time; but this could
     not be the famous coffee-house in Covent Garden, because he mentions
     visiting there for the first time, February 3rd, 1663-64.  It was
     most probably the house of William Joyce, who kept a place of
     entertainment at Westminster (see Jan. 29th).]

and there sat with Mr. Ashwell talking and singing till nine o'clock,
and so home, there, having not eaten anything but bread and cheese, my
wife cut me a slice of brawn which. I received from my Lady;--[Jemima,
wife of Sir Edward Montagu, daughter of John Crew of Stene, afterwards
Lord Crew.]--which proves as good as ever I had any. So to bed, and my
wife had a very bad night of it through wind and cold.

3rd. I went out in the morning, it being a great frost, and walked to
Mrs. Turner's

     [Jane, daughter of John Pepys of South Creake, Norfolk, married to
     John Turner, Sergeant-at-law, Recorder of York; their only child,
     Theophila, frequently mentioned as The.  or Theoph., became the wife
     of Sir Arthur Harris, Bart., of Stowford, Devon, and died 1686,
     s.p.]

to stop her from coming to see me to-day, because of Mrs. Jem's corning,
thence I went to the Temple to speak with Mr. Calthrop, and walked in
his chamber an hour, but could not see him, so went to Westminster,
where I found soldiers in my office to receive money, and paid it them.
At noon went home, where Mrs. Jem, her maid, Mr. Sheply, Hawly, and
Moore dined with me on a piece of beef and cabbage, and a collar of
brawn. We then fell to cards till dark, and then I went home with Mrs.
Jem, and meeting Mr. Hawly got him to bear me company to Chancery Lane,
where I spoke with Mr. Calthrop, he told me that Sir James Calthrop was
lately dead, but that he would write to his Lady, that the money may be
speedily paid. Thence back to White Hall, where I understood that the
Parliament had passed the act for indemnity to the soldiers and officers
that would come in, in so many days, and that my Lord Lambert should
have benefit of the said act. They had also voted that all vacancies in
the House, by the death of any of the old members, shall be filled up;
but those that are living shall not be called in. Thence I went home,
and there found Mr. Hunt and his wife, and Mr. Hawly, who sat with me
till ten at night at cards, and so broke up and to bed.

4th. Early came Mr. Vanly--[Mr Vanley appears to have been Pepys's
landlord; he is mentioned again in the Diary on September 20th,
1660.]--to me for his half-year's rent, which I had not in the house,
but took his man to the office and there paid him. Then I went down
into the Hall and to Will's, where Hawly brought a piece of his Cheshire
cheese, and we were merry with it. Then into the Hall again, where I met
with the Clerk and Quarter Master of my Lord's troop, and took them to
the Swan' and gave them their morning's draft,

     [It was not usual at this time to sit down to breakfast, but instead
     a morning draught was taken at a tavern.]

they being just come to town. Mr. Jenkins shewed me two bills of
exchange for money to receive upon my Lord's and my pay. It snowed hard
all this morning, and was very cold, and my nose was much swelled with
cold. Strange the difference of men's talk! Some say that Lambert must
of necessity yield up; others, that he is very strong, and that the
Fifth-monarchy-men [will] stick to him, if he declares for a free
Parliament. Chillington was sent yesterday to him with the vote of
pardon and indemnity from the Parliament. From the Hall I came home,
where I found letters from Hinchinbroke

     [Hinchinbroke was Sir Edward Montagu's seat, from which he
     afterwards took his second title.  Hinchinbroke House, so often
     mentioned in the Diary, stood about half a mile to the westward of
     the town of Huntingdon.  It was erected late in the reign of
     Elizabeth, by Sir Henry Cromwell, on the site of a Benedictine
     nunnery, granted at the Dissolution, with all its appurtenances, to
     his father, Richard Williams, who had assumed the name of Cromwell,
     and whose grandson, Sir Oliver, was the uncle and godfather of the
     Protector.  The knight, who was renowned for, his hospitality, had
     the honour of entertaining King James at Hinchinbroke, but, getting
     into pecuniary difficulties, was obliged to sell his estates, which
     were conveyed, July 28th, 1627, to Sir Sidney Montagu of Barnwell,
     father of the first Earl of Sandwich, in whose descendant they are
     still vested.  On the morning of the 22nd January, 1830, during the
     minority of the seventh Earl, Hinchinbroke was almost entirely
     destroyed by fire, but the pictures and furniture were mostly saved,
     and the house has been rebuilt in the Elizabethan style, and the
     interior greatly improved, under the direction of Edward Blore,
     Esq., R.A.--B.]

and news of Mr. Sheply's going thither the next week. I dined at home,
and from thence went to Will's to Shaw, who promised me to go along with
me to Atkinson's about some money, but I found him at cards with Spicer
and D. Vines, and could not get him along with me. I was vext at this,
and went and walked in the Hall, where I heard that the Parliament spent
this day in fasting and prayer; and in the afternoon came letters from
the North, that brought certain news that my Lord Lambent his forces
were all forsaking him, and that he was left with only fifty horse, and
that he did now declare for the Parliament himself; and that my Lord
Fairfax did also rest satisfied, and had laid down his arms, and that
what he had done was only to secure the country against my Lord Lambert
his raising of money, and free quarter. I went to Will's again, where
I found them still at cards, and Spicer had won 14s. of Shaw and Vines.
Then I spent a little time with G. Vines and Maylard at Vines's at our
viols.

     [It was usual to have a "chest of viols," which consisted of six,
     viz., two trebles, two tenors, and two basses (see note in North's
     "Memoirs of Musick," ed.  Rimbault, p. 70).  The bass viol was also
     called the 'viola da gamba', because it was held between the legs.]

So home, and from thence to Mr. Hunt's, and sat with them and Mr. Hawly
at cards till ten at night, and was much made of by them. Home and so to
bed, but much troubled with my nose, which was much swelled.

5th. I went to my office, where the money was again expected from
the Excise office, but none brought, but was promised to be sent this
afternoon. I dined with Mr. Sheply, at my Lord's lodgings, upon his
turkey-pie. And so to my office again; where the Excise money was
brought, and some of it told to soldiers till it was dark. Then I went
home, and after writing a letter to my Lord and told him the news
that the Parliament hath this night voted that the members that were
discharged from sitting in the years 1648 and 49, were duly discharged;
and that there should be writs issued presently for the calling of
others in their places, and that Monk and Fairfax were commanded up to
town, and that the Prince's lodgings were to be provided for Monk at
Whitehall. Then my wife and I, it being a great frost, went to Mrs.
Jem's, in expectation to eat a sack-posset, but Mr. Edward--[Edward
Montage, son of Sir Edward, and afterwards Lord Hinchinbroke.]--not
coming it was put off; and so I left my wife playing at cards with her,
and went myself with my lanthorn to Mr. Fage, to consult concerning
my nose, who told me it was nothing but cold, and after that we did
discourse concerning public business; and he told me it is true the City
had not time enough to do much, but they are resolved to shake off the
soldiers; and that unless there be a free Parliament chosen, he did
believe there are half the Common Council will not levy any money by
order of this Parliament. From thence I went to my father's, where I
found Mrs. Ramsey and her grandchild, a pretty girl, and staid a while
and talked with them and my mother, and then took my leave, only
heard of an invitation to go to dinner to-morrow to my cosen Thomas
Pepys.--[Thomas Pepys, probably the son of Thomas Pepys of London (born,
1595), brother of Samuel's father, John Pepys.]--I went back to Mrs.
Jem, and took my wife and Mrs. Sheply, and went home.

6th. This morning Mr. Sheply and I did eat our breakfast at Mrs.
Harper's, (my brother John' being with me,)

     [John Pepys was born in 1641, and his brother Samuel took great
     interest in his welfare, but he did not do any great credit to his
     elder.]

upon a cold turkey-pie and a goose. From thence I went to my office,
where we paid money to the soldiers till one o'clock, at which time
we made an end, and I went home and took my wife and went to my cosen,
Thomas Pepys, and found them just sat down to dinner, which was very
good; only the venison pasty was palpable beef, which was not
handsome. After dinner I took my leave, leaving my wife with my cozen
Stradwick,--[Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Pepys, Lord Chief Justice of
Ireland, and wife of Thomas Stradwick.]--and went to Westminster to Mr.
Vines, where George and I fiddled a good while, Dick and his wife (who
was lately brought to bed) and her sister being there, but Mr. Hudson
not coming according to his promise, I went away, and calling at my
house on the wench, I took her and the lanthorn with me to my cosen
Stradwick, where, after a good supper, there being there my father,
mother, brothers, and sister, my cosen Scott and his wife, Mr. Drawwater
and his wife, and her brother, Mr. Stradwick, we had a brave cake
brought us, and in the choosing, Pall was Queen and Mr. Stradwick was
King. After that my wife and I bid adieu and came home, it being still a
great frost.

7th. At my office as I was receiving money of the probate of wills, in
came Mrs. Turner, Theoph., Madame Morrice, and Joyce, and after I had
done I took them home to my house and Mr. Hawly came after, and I got a
dish of steaks and a rabbit for them, while they were playing a game or
two at cards. In the middle of our dinner a messenger from Mr. Downing
came to fetch me to him, so leaving Mr. Hawly there, I went and was
forced to stay till night in expectation of the French Embassador, who
at last came, and I had a great deal of good discourse with one of his
gentlemen concerning the reason of the difference between the zeal of
the French and the Spaniard. After he was gone I went home, and found
my friends still at cards, and after that I went along with them to Dr.
Whores (sending my wife to Mrs. Jem's to a sack-posset), where I
heard some symphony and songs of his own making, performed by Mr. May,
Harding, and Mallard. Afterwards I put my friends into a coach, and went
to Mrs. Jem's, where I wrote a letter to my Lord by the post, and had my
part of the posset which was saved for me, and so we went home, and put
in at my Lord's lodgings, where we staid late, eating of part of his
turkey-pie, and reading of Quarles' Emblems. So home and to bed.

8th (Sunday). In the morning I went to Mr. Gunning's, where a good
sermon, wherein he showed the life of Christ, and told us good authority
for us to believe that Christ did follow his father's trade, and was
a carpenter till thirty years of age. From thence to my father's to
dinner, where I found my wife, who was forced to dine there, we not
having one coal of fire in the house, and it being very hard frosty
weather. In the afternoon my father, he going to a man's to demand some
money due to my Aunt Bells my wife and I went to Mr. Mossum's, where a
strange doctor made a very good sermon. From thence sending my wife to
my father's, I went to Mrs. Turner's, and staid a little while, and then
to my father's, where I found Mr. Sheply, and after supper went home
together. Here I heard of the death of Mr. Palmer, and that he was to be
buried at Westminster tomorrow.

9th. For these two or three days I have been much troubled with thoughts
how to get money to pay them that I have borrowed money of, by reason
of my money being in my uncle's hands. I rose early this morning, and
looked over and corrected my brother John's speech, which he is to make
the next apposition,--[Declamations at St. Paul's School, in which
there were opponents and respondents.]--and after that I went towards my
office, and in my way met with W. Simons, Muddiman, and Jack Price, and
went with them to Harper's and in many sorts of talk I staid till two
of the clock in the afternoon. I found Muddiman a good scholar, an arch
rogue; and owns that though he writes new books for the Parliament,
yet he did declare that he did it only to get money; and did talk very
basely of many of them. Among other things, W. Simons told me how his
uncle Scobel was on Saturday last called to the bar, for entering in
the journal of the House, for the year 1653, these words: "This day his
Excellence the Lord General Cromwell dissolved this House;" which words
the Parliament voted a forgery, and demanded of him how they came to be
entered. He answered that they were his own handwriting, and that he
did it by virtue of his office, and the practice of his predecessor; and
that the intent of the practice was to--let posterity know how such and
such a Parliament was dissolved, whether by the command of the King, or
by their own neglect, as the last House of Lords was; and that to this
end, he had said and writ that it was dissolved by his Excellence the
Lord G[eneral]; and that for the word dissolved, he never at the time
did hear of any other term; and desired pardon if he would not dare
to make a word himself when it was six years after, before they came
themselves to call it an interruption; but they were so little satisfied
with this answer, that they did chuse a committee to report to the
House, whether this crime of Mr. Scobell's did come within the act of
indemnity or no. Thence I went with Muddiman to the Coffee-House, and
gave 18d. to be entered of the Club. Thence into the Hall, where I
heard for certain that Monk was coming to London, and that Bradshaw's 2
lodgings were preparing for him. Thence to Mrs. Jem's, and found her in
bed, and she was afraid that it would prove the small-pox. Thence back
to Westminster Hall, where I heard how Sir H. Vane--[Sir Harry Vane the
younger, an inflexible republican. He was executed in 1662, on a charge
of conspiring the death of Charles I.]--was this day voted out of the
House, and to sit no more there; and that he would retire himself to his
house at Raby, as also all the rest of the nine officers that had their
commissions formerly taken away from them, were commanded to their
farthest houses from London during the pleasure of the Parliament. Here
I met with the Quarter Master of my Lord's troop, and his clerk Mr.
Jenings, and took them home, and gave them a bottle of wine, and the
remainder of my collar of brawn; and so good night. After that came in
Mr. Hawly, who told me that I was mist this day at my office, and that
to-morrow I must pay all the money that I have, at which I was put to a
great loss how I should get money to make up my cash, and so went to bed
in great trouble.

10th. Went out early, and in my way met with Greatorex,--[Ralph
Greatorex, the well-known mathematical instrument maker of his day. He
is frequently mentioned by Pepys.]--and at an alehouse he showed me the
first sphere of wire that ever he made, and indeed it was very pleasant;
thence to Mr. Crew's, and borrowed L10, and so to my office, and was
able to pay my money. Thence into the Hall, and meeting the Quarter
Master, Jenings, and Captain Rider, we four went to a cook's to dinner.
Thence Jenings and I into London (it being through heat of the sun a
great thaw and dirty) to show our bills of return, and coming back drank
a pint of wine at the Star in Cheapside. So to Westminster, overtaking
Captain Okeshott in his silk cloak, whose sword got hold of many people
in walking. Thence to the Coffee-house, where were a great confluence of
gentlemen; viz. Mr. Harrington, Poultny, chairman, Gold, Dr. Petty; &c.,
where admirable discourse till at night. Thence with Doling to Mother
Lams, who told me how this day Scott

     [Thomas Scott, M.P., was made Secretary of State to the Commonwealth
     on the 17th of this same January.  He signed the death warrant of
     Charles I., for which he was executed at Charing Cross, October
     16th, 1660.  He gloried in his offence, and desired to have written
     on his tombstone, "Thomas Scott who adjudged to death the late
     king."]

was made Intelligencer, and that the rest of the members that were
objected against last night, their business was to be heard this day
se'nnight. Thence I went home and wrote a letter, and went to Harper's,
and staid there till Tom carried it to the postboy at Whitehall. So home
to bed.

11th. Being at Will's with Captain Barker, who hath paid me L300 this
morning at my office, in comes my father, and with him I walked, and
leave him at W. Joyce's, and went myself to Mr. Crew's, but came too
late to dine, and therefore after a game at shittle-cocks--[The game
of battledore and shuttlecock was formerly much played even in tennis
courts, and was a very violent game.]--with Mr. Walgrave and Mr. Edward,
I returned to my father, and taking him from W. Joyce's, who was not
abroad himself, we inquired of a porter, and by his direction went to an
alehouse, where after a cup or two we parted. I went towards London, and
in my way went in to see Crowly, who was now grown a very great loon and
very tame. Thence to Mr. Steven's with a pair of silver snuffers, and
bought a pair of shears to cut silver, and so homeward again. From home
I went to see Mrs. Jem, who was in bed, and now granted to have the
small-pox. Back again, and went to the Coffee-house, but tarried not,
and so home.

12th. I drink my morning at Harper's with Mr. Sheply and a seaman, and
so to my office, where Captain Holland came to see me, and appointed a
meeting in the afternoon. Then wrote letters to Hinchinbroke and sealed
them at Will's, and after that went home, and thence to the Half Moon,
where I found the Captain and Mr. Billingsly and Newman, a barber, where
we were very merry, and had the young man that plays so well on the
Welsh harp. Billingsly paid for all. Thence home, and finding my letters
this day not gone by the carrier I new sealed them, but my brother Tom
coming we fell into discourse about my intention to feast the Joyces.
I sent for a bit of meat for him from the cook's, and forgot to send my
letters this night. So I went to bed, and in discourse broke to my wife
what my thoughts were concerning my design of getting money by, &c.

13th. Coming in the morning to my office, I met with Mr. Fage and took
him to the Swan? He told me how high Haselrigge, and Morly, the last
night began at my Lord Mayor's to exclaim against the City of London,
saying that they had forfeited their charter. And how the Chamberlain
of the City did take them down, letting them know how much they were
formerly beholding to the City, &c. He also told me that Monk's letter
that came to them by the sword-bearer was a cunning piece, and that
which they did not much trust to; but they were resolved to make no
more applications to the Parliament, nor to pay any money, unless the
secluded members be brought in, or a free Parliament chosen. Thence
to my office, where nothing to do. So to Will's with Mr. Pinkney, who
invited me to their feast at his Hall the next Monday. Thence I went
home and took my wife and dined at Mr. Wades, and after that we went and
visited Catan. From thence home again, and my wife was very unwilling to
let me go forth, but with some discontent would go out if I did, and I
going forth towards Whitehall, I saw she followed me, and so I staid and
took her round through Whitehall, and so carried her home angry. Thence
I went to Mrs. Jem, and found her up and merry, and that it did not
prove the small-pox, but only the swine-pox; so I played a game or two
at cards with her. And so to Mr. Vines, where he and I and Mr. Hudson
played half-a-dozen things, there being there Dick's wife and her
sister. After that I went home and found my wife gone abroad to Mr.
Hunt's, and came in a little after me.--So to bed.

14th. Nothing to do at our office. Thence into the Hall, and just as I
was going to dinner from Westminster Hall with Mr. Moore (with whom
I had been in the lobby to hear news, and had spoke with Sir Anthony
Ashley Cooper about my Lord's lodgings) to his house, I met with Captain
Holland, who told me that he hath brought his wife to my house, so I
posted home and got a dish of meat for them. They staid with me all the
afternoon, and went hence in the evening. Then I went with my wife,
and left her at market, and went myself to the Coffee-house, and
heard exceeding good argument against Mr. Harrington's assertion,
that overbalance of propriety [i.e., property] was the foundation of
government. Home, and wrote to Hinchinbroke, and sent that and my other
letter that missed of going on Thursday last. So to bed.

15th. Having been exceedingly disturbed in the night with the barking
of a dog of one of our neighbours that I could not sleep for an hour
or two, I slept late, and then in the morning took physic, and so staid
within all day. At noon my brother John came to me, and I corrected as
well as I could his Greek speech to say the Apposition, though I believe
he himself was as well able to do it as myself. After that we went to
read in the great Officiale about the blessing of bells in the Church of
Rome. After that my wife and I in pleasant discourse till night, then
I went to supper, and after that to make an end of this week's notes in
this book, and so to bed. It being a cold day and a great snow my physic
did not work so well as it should have done.

16th. In the morning I went up to Mr. Crew's, and at his bedside he gave
me direction to go to-morrow with Mr. Edward to Twickenham, and likewise
did talk to me concerning things of state; and expressed his mind how
just it was that the secluded members should come to sit again. I went
from thence, and in my way went into an alehouse and drank my morning
draft with Matthew Andrews and two or three more of his friends,
coachmen. And of one of them I did hire a coach to carry us to-morrow
to Twickenham. From thence to my office, where nothing to do; but Mr.
Downing he came and found me all alone; and did mention to me his going
back into Holland, and did ask me whether I would go or no, but gave me
little encouragement, but bid me consider of it; and asked me whether I
did not think that Mr. Hawly could perform the work of my office alone
or no. I confess I was at a great loss, all the day after, to bethink
myself how to carry this business. At noon, Harry Ethall came to me and
went along with Mr. Maylard by coach as far as Salsbury Court, and there
we set him down, and we went to the Clerks, where we came a little
too late, but in a closet we had a very good dinner by Mr. Pinkny's
courtesy, and after dinner we had pretty good singing, and one, Hazard,
sung alone after the old fashion, which was very much cried up, but I
did not like it. Thence we went to the Green Dragon, on Lambeth Hill,
both the Mr. Pinkney's, Smith, Harrison, Morrice, that sang the bass,
Sheply and I, and there we sang of all sorts of things, and I ventured
with good success upon things at first sight, and after that I played on
my flageolet, and staid there till nine o'clock, very merry and drawn
on with one song after another till it came to be so late. After that
Sheply, Harrison and myself, we went towards Westminster on foot, and
at the Golden Lion, near Charing Cross, we went in and drank a pint of
wine, and so parted, and thence home, where I found my wife and maid
a-washing. I staid up till the bell-man came by with his bell just under
my window as I was writing of this very line, and cried, "Past one of
the clock, and a cold, frosty, windy morning." I then went to bed, and
left my wife and the maid a-washing still.

17th. Early I went to Mr. Crew's, and having given Mr. Edward money
to give the servants, I took him into the coach that waited for us and
carried him to my house, where the coach waited for me while I and the
child went to Westminster Hall, and bought him some pictures. In the
Hall I met Mr. Woodfine, and took him to Will's and drank with him.
Thence the child and I to the coach, where my wife was ready, and so
we went towards Twickenham. In our way, at Kensington we understood how
that my Lord Chesterfield had killed another gentleman about half an
hour before, and was fled.

     [Philip Stanhope, second Earl of Chesterfield, ob. 1713, act. suae
     80.  We learn, from the memoir prefixed to his "Printed
     Correspondence," that he fought three duels, disarming and wounding
     his first and second antagonists, and killing the third.  The name
     of the unfortunate gentleman who fell on this occasion was Woolly.
     Lord Chesterfield, absconding, went to Breda, where he obtained the
     royal pardon from Charles II.  He acted a busy part in the eventful
     times in which he lived, and was remarkable for his steady adherence
     to the Stuarts.  Lord Chesterfield's letter to Charles II., and the
     King's answer granting the royal pardon, occur in the Correspondence
     published by General Sir John Murray, in 1829.

     "Jan. 17th, 1659.  The Earl of Chesterfield and Dr. Woolly's son of
     Hammersmith, had a quarrel about a mare of eighteen pounds price;
     the quarrel would not be reconciled, insomuch that a challenge
     passed between them.  They fought a duel on the backside of Mr.
     Colby's house at Kensington, where the Earl and he had several
     passes.  The Earl wounded him in two places, and would fain have
     then ended, but the stubbornness and pride of heart of Mr. Woolly
     would not give over, and the next pass [he] was killed on the spot.
     The Earl fled to Chelsea, and there took water and escaped.  The
     jury found it chance-medley."--Rugge's "Diurnal," Addit  MSS.,
     British Museum.--B.]

We went forward and came about one of the clock to Mr. Fuller's, but he
was out of town, so we had a dinner there, and I gave the child 40s.
to give to the two ushers. After that we parted and went homewards, it
being market day at Brainford [Brentford]. I set my wife down and went
with the coach to Mr. Crew's, thinking to have spoke with Mr. Moore
and Mrs. Jem, he having told me the reason of his melancholy was some
unkindness from her after so great expressions of love, and how he had
spoke to her friends and had their consent, and that he would desire
me to take an occasion of speaking with her, but by no means not to
heighten her discontent or distaste whatever it be, but to make it up if
I can. But he being out of doors, I went away and went to see Mrs. Jem,
who was now very well again, and after a game or two at cards, I left
her. So I went to the Coffee Club, and heard very good discourse; it
was in answer to Mr. Harrington's answer, who said that the state of the
Roman government was not a settled government, and so it was no wonder
that the balance of propriety [i.e., property] was in one hand, and the
command in another, it being therefore always in a posture of war; but
it was carried by ballot, that it was a steady government, though it is
true by the voices it had been carried before that it was an unsteady
government; so to-morrow it is to be proved by the opponents that the
balance lay in one hand, and the government in another. Thence I went
to Westminster, and met Shaw and Washington, who told me how this day
Sydenham

     [Colonel William Sydenham had been an active officer during the
     Civil Wars, on the Parliament side; M.P. for Dorsetshire, Governor
     of Melcombe, and one of the Committee of Safety.  He was the elder
     brother of the celebrated physician of that name.--B.]

was voted out of the House for sitting any more this Parliament, and
that Salloway was voted out likewise and sent to the Tower, during
the pleasure of the House. Home and wrote by the Post, and carried to
Whitehall, and coming back turned in at Harper-'s, where Jack Price was,
and I drank with him and he told me, among other, things, how much the
Protector

     [Richard Cromwell, third son of Oliver Cromwell, born October 4th,
     1626, admitted a member of Lincoln's Inn, May 27th, 1647, fell into
     debt and devoted himself to hunting and field sports.  His
     succession to his father as Protector was universally accepted at
     first, but the army soon began to murmur because he was not a
     general.  Between the dissensions of various parties he fell, and
     the country was left in a state of anarchy: He went abroad early in
     the summer of 1660, and lived abroad for some years, returning to
     England in 1680.  After his fall he bore the name of John Clarke.
     Died at Cheshunt, July 12th, 1712.]

is altered, though he would seem to bear out his trouble very well, yet
he is scarce able to talk sense with a man; and how he will say that
"Who should a man trust, if he may not trust to a brother and an uncle;"
and "how much those men have to answer before God Almighty, for their
playing the knave with him as they did." He told me also, that there
was; L100,000 offered, and would have been taken for his restitution,
had not the Parliament come in as they did again; and that he do believe
that the Protector will live to give a testimony of his valour and
revenge yet before he dies, and that the Protector will say so himself
sometimes. Thence I went home, it being late and my wife in bed.

18th. To my office and from thence to Will's, and there Mr. Sheply
brought me letters from the carrier and so I went home. After that to
Wilkinson's, where we had a dinner for Mr. Talbot, Adams, Pinkny and his
son, but his son did not come. Here we were very merry, and while I was
here Mr. Fuller came thither and staid a little, while.

After that we all went to my Lord's, whither came afterwards Mr.
Harrison, and by chance seeing Mr. Butler--[Mr. Butler is usually styled
by Pepys Mons. l'Impertinent.]--coming by I called him in and so we
sat drinking a bottle of wine till night. At which time Mistress
Ann--[Probably Mrs. (afterwards Lady) Anne Montagu, daughter of Sir
Edward Montagu, and sister to Mrs. Jem.]--came with the key of my Lord's
study for some things, and so we all broke up and after I had gone to my
house and interpreted my Lord's letter by his character--[The making of
ciphers was a popular amusement about this time. Pepys made several for
Montagu, Downing, and others.]--I came to her again and went with her to
her lodging and from thence to Mr. Crew's, where I advised with him
what to do about my Lord's lodgings and what answer to give to Sir Ant.
Cooper and so I came home and to bed. All the world is at a loss to
think what Monk will do: the City saying that he will be for them, and
the Parliament saying he will be for them.

19th. This morning I was sent for to Mr. Downing, and at his bed side he
told me, that he had a kindness for me, and that he thought that he had
done me one; and that was, that he had got me to be one of the Clerks of
the Council; at which I was a little stumbled, and could not tell what
to do, whether to thank him or no; but by and by I did; but not very
heartily, for I feared that his doing of it was but only to ease himself
of the salary which he gives me. After that Mr. Sheply staying below all
this time for me we went thence and met Mr. Pierce,

     [Pepys had two friends named Pierce, one the surgeon and the other
     the purser; he usually (but not always) distinguishes them.  The one
     here alluded to was probably the surgeon, and husband of pretty Mrs.
     Pierce.  After the Restoration James Pearse or Pierce became Surgeon
     to the Duke of York, and he was also Surgeon-General of the Fleet.]

so at the Harp and Ball drank our morning draft and so to Whitehall
where I met with Sir Ant. Cooper and did give him some answer from my
Lord and he did give us leave to keep the lodgings still. And so we did
determine thereupon that Mr. Sheply might now go into the country and
would do so to-morrow. Back I went by Mr. Downing's order and staid
there till twelve o'clock in expectation of one to come to read some
writings, but he came not, so I staid all alone reading the answer of
the Dutch Ambassador to our State, in answer to the reasons of my Lord's
coming home, which he gave for his coming, and did labour herein to
contradict my Lord's arguments for his coming home. Thence to my office
and so with Mr. Sheply and Moore, to dine upon a turkey with Mrs. Jem,
and after that Mr. Moore and I went to the French Ordinary, where Mr.
Downing this day feasted Sir Arth. Haselrigge, and a great many more of
the Parliament, and did stay to put him in mind of me. Here he gave me
a note to go and invite some other members to dinner tomorrow. So I went
to White Hall, and did stay at Marsh's, with Simons, Luellin, and all
the rest of the Clerks of the Council, who I hear are all turned out,
only the two Leighs, and they do all tell me that my name was mentioned
the last night, but that nothing was done in it. Hence I went and did
leave some of my notes at the lodgings of the members and so home. To
bed.

20th. In the morning I went to Mr. Downing's bedside and gave him an
account what I had done as to his guests, land I went thence to my Lord
Widdrington who I met in the street, going to seal the patents for
the judges to-day, and so could not come to dinner. I called upon Mr.
Calthrop about the money due to my Lord. Here I met with Mr. Woodfine
and drank with him at the Sun in Chancery Lane and so to Westminster
Hall, where at the lobby I spoke with the rest of my guests and so to my
office. At noon went by water with Mr. Maylard and Hales to the Swan in
Fish Street at our Goal Feast, where we were very merry at our Jole
of Ling, and from thence after a great and good dinner Mr. Falconberge
would go drink a cup of ale at a place where I had like to have shot
at a scholar that lay over the house of office. Thence calling on Mr.
Stephens and Wootton (with whom I drank) about business of my Lord's I
went to the Coffee Club where there was nothing done but choosing of a
Committee for orders. Thence to Westminster Hall where Mrs. Lane and the
rest of the maids had their white scarfs, all having been at the burial
of a young bookseller in the Hall.

     [These stationers and booksellers, whose shops disfigured
     Westminster Hall down to a late period, were a privileged class.
     In the statutes for appointing licensers and regulating the press,
     there is a clause exempting them from the pains and penalties of
     these obnoxious laws.]

Thence to Mr. Sheply's and took him to my house and drank with him in
order to his going to-morrow. So parted and I sat up late making up my
accounts before he go. This day three citizens of London went to meet
Monk from the Common Council!

     "Jan. 20th.  Then there went out of the City, by desire of the Lord
     Mayor and Court of Aldermen, Alderman Fowke and Alderman Vincett,
     alias Vincent, and Mr. Broomfield, to compliment General Monk, who
     lay at Harborough Town, in Leicestershire."

     "Jan. 21st.  Because the Speaker was sick, and Lord General Monk so
     near London, and everybody thought that the City would suffer for
     their affronts to the soldiery, and because they had sent the sword-
     bearer to, the General without the Parliament's consent, and the
     three Aldermen were gone to give him the welcome to town, these four
     lines were in almost everybody's mouth:

                   "Monk under a hood, not well understood,
                    The City pull in their horns;
                    The Speaker is out, and sick of the gout,
                    And the Parliament sit upon thorns."
                    --Rugge's 'Diurnal.'--B."

21st. Up early in finishing my accounts and writing to my Lord and from
thence to my Lord's and took leave of Mr. Sheply and possession of all
the keys and the house. Thence to my office for some money to pay Mr.
Sheply and sent it him by the old man. I then went to Mr. Downing who
chid me because I did not give him notice of some of his guests failed
him but I told him that I sent our porter to tell him and he was not
within, but he told me that he was within till past twelve o'clock. So
the porter or he lied. Thence to my office where nothing to do. Then
with Mr. Hawly, he and I went to Mr. Crew's and dined there. Thence
into London, to Mr. Vernon's and I received my L25 due by bill for my
troopers' pay. Then back again to Steadman's. At the Mitre, in Fleet
street, in our way calling on Mr. Fage, who told me how the City have
some hopes of Monk. Thence to the Mitre, where I drank a pint of wine,
the house being in fitting for Banister to come hither from Paget's.
Thence to Mrs. Jem and gave her L5. So home and left my money and to
Whitehall where Luellin and I drank and talked together an hour at
Marsh's and so up to the clerks' room, where poor Mr. Cook, a black man,
that is like to be put out of his clerk's place, came and railed at me
for endeavouring to put him out and get myself in, when I was already
in a good condition. But I satisfied him and after I had wrote a letter
there to my Lord, wherein I gave him an account how this day Lenthall
took his chair again, and [the House] resolved a declaration to be
brought in on Monday next to satisfy the world what they intend to do.
So home and to bed.

22nd. I went in the morning to Mr. Messum's, where I met with W.
Thurburn and sat with him in his pew. A very eloquent sermon about the
duty of all to give good example in our lives and conversation, which I
fear he himself was most guilty of not doing. After sermon, at the door
by appointment my wife met me, and so to my father's to dinner, where we
had not been to my shame in a fortnight before. After dinner my father
shewed me a letter from Mr. Widdrington, of Christ's College, in
Cambridge, wherein he do express very great kindness for my brother,
and my father intends that my brother shall go to him. To church in the
afternoon to Mr. Herring, where a lazy poor sermon. And so home with
Mrs. Turner and sitting with her a while we went to my father's where we
supt very merry, and so home. This day I began to put on buckles to my
shoes, which I have bought yesterday of Mr. Wotton.

23rd. In the morning called out to carry L20 to Mr. Downing, which I did
and came back, and finding Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, I took him to the
Axe and gave him his morning draft. Thence to my office and there did
nothing but make up my balance. Came home and found my wife dressing of
the girl's head, by which she was made to look very pretty. I went out
and paid Wilkinson what I did owe him, and brought a piece of beef home
for dinner. Thence I went out and paid Waters, the vintner, and went to
see Mrs. Jem, where I found my Lady Wright, but Scott was so drunk that
he could not be seen. Here I staid and made up Mrs. Ann's bills, and
played a game or two at cards, and thence to Westminster Hall, it being
very dark. I paid Mrs. Michell, my bookseller, and back to Whitehall,
and in the garden, going through to the Stone Gallery--[The Stone
Gallery was a long passage between the Privy Garden and the river. It
led from the Bowling Green to the Court of the Palace]--I fell into a
ditch, it being very dark. At the Clerk's chamber I met with Simons
and Luellin, and went with them to Mr. Mount's chamber at the Cock Pit,
where we had some rare pot venison, and ale to abundance till almost
twelve at night, and after a song round we went home. This day the
Parliament sat late, and resolved of the declaration to be printed for
the people's satisfaction, promising them a great many good things.

24th. In the morning to my office, where, after I had drank my morning
draft at Will's with Ethell and Mr. Stevens, I went and told part of the
excise money till twelve o'clock, and then called on my wife and took
her to Mr. Pierces, she in the way being exceedingly troubled with a
pair of new pattens, and I vexed to go so slow, it being late. There
when we came we found Mrs. Carrick very fine, and one Mr. Lucy, who
called one another husband and wife, and after dinner a great deal
of mad stir. There was pulling off Mrs. bride's and Mr. bridegroom's
ribbons;

     [The scramble for ribbons, here mentioned by Pepys in connection
     with weddings (see also January 26th, 1660-61, and February 8th,
     1662-3), doubtless formed part of the ceremony of undressing the
     bridegroom, which, as the age became more refined, fell into disuse.
     All the old plays are silent on the custom; the earliest notice of
     which occurs in the old ballad of the wedding of Arthur O'Bradley,
     printed in the Appendix to "Robin Hood," 1795, where we read--

                   "Then got they his points and his garters,
                    And cut them in pieces like martyrs;
                    And then they all did play
                    For the honour of Arthur O'Bradley."

     Sir Winston Churchill also observes ("Divi Britannici," p. 340) that
     James I. was no more troubled at his querulous countrymen robbing
     him than a bridegroom at the losing of his points and garters.  Lady
     Fanshawe, in her "Memoirs," says, that at the nuptials of Charles
     II. and the Infanta, "the Bishop of London declared them married in
     the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and then they
     caused the ribbons her Majesty wore to be cut in little pieces; and
     as far as they would go, every one had some."  The practice still
     survives in the form of wedding favours.

     A similar custom is still of every day's occurrence at Dieppe.  Upon
     the morrow after their marriage, the bride and bridegroom
     perambulate the streets, followed by a numerous cortege, the guests
     at the wedding festival, two and two; each individual wearing two
     bits of narrow ribbon, about two inches in length, of different
     colours, which are pinned crossways upon the breast.  These morsels
     of ribbons originally formed the garters of the bride and
     bridegroom, which had been divided amidst boisterous mirth among the
     assembled company, the moment the happy pair had been formally
     installed in the bridal bed.--Ex. inf.  Mr. William.Hughes,
     Belvedere, Jersey.--B.]

with a great deal of fooling among them that I and my wife did not like.
Mr. Lucy and several other gentlemen coming in after dinner, swearing
and singing as if they were mad, only he singing very handsomely. There
came in afterwards Mr. Southerne, clerk to Mr. Blackburne, and with
him Lambert, lieutenant of my Lord's ship, and brought with them the
declaration that came out to-day from the Parliament, wherein they
declare for law and gospel, and for tythes; but I do not find people apt
to believe them. After this taking leave I went to my father's, and
my wife staying there, he and I went to speak with Mr. Crumlum (in the
meantime, while it was five o'clock, he being in the school, we went
to my cozen Tom Pepys' shop, the turner in Paul's Churchyard, and drank
with him a pot of ale); he gave my father directions what to do about
getting my brother an exhibition, and spoke very well of my brother.
Thence back with my father home, where he and I spoke privately in the
little room to my sister Pall about stealing of things as my wife's
scissars and my maid's book, at which my father was much troubled. Hence
home with my wife and so to Whitehall, where I met with Mr. Hunt and
Luellin, and drank with them at Marsh's, and afterwards went up and
wrote to my Lord by the post. This day the Parliament gave order that
the late Committee of Safety should come before them this day se'nnight,
and all their papers, and their model of Government that they had made,
to be brought in with them. So home and talked with my wife about our
dinner on Thursday.

25th. Called up early to Mr. Downing; he gave me a Character, such a one
as my Lord's, to make perfect, and likewise gave me his order for L500
to carry to Mr. Frost, which I did and so to my office, where I did do
something about the character till twelve o'clock. Then home find
found my wife and the maid at my Lord's getting things ready against
to-morrow. I went by water to my Uncle White's' to dinner, where I
met my father, where we alone had a fine jole of Ling to dinner. After
dinner I took leave, and coming home heard that in Cheapside there had
been but a little before a gibbet set up, and the picture of Huson

     [John Hewson, who, from a low origin, became a colonel in the
     Parliament army, and sat in judgment on the King: he escaped hanging
     by flight, and died in 1662, at Amsterdam.  A curious notice of
     Hewson occurs in Rugge's "Diurnal," December 5th, 1659, which states
     that "he was a cobbler by trade, but a very stout man, and a very
     good commander; but in regard of his former employment, they [the
     city apprentices] threw at him old shoes, and slippers, and
     turniptops, and brick-bats, stones, and tiles."...  "At this
     time [January, 1659-60] there came forth, almost every day, jeering
     books: one was called 'Colonel Hewson's Confession; or, a Parley
     with Pluto,' about his going into London, and taking down the gates
     of Temple-Bar."  He had but one eye, which did not escape the notice
     of his enemies.--B.]

hung upon it in the middle of the street. I called at Paul's Churchyard,
where I bought Buxtorf's Hebrew Grammar; and read a declaration of the
gentlemen of Northampton which came out this afternoon. Thence to my
father's, where I staid with my mother a while and then to Mr. Crew's
about a picture to be sent into the country, of Mr. Thomas Crew, to my
Lord. So [to] my Lady Wright to speak with her, but she was abroad, so
Mr. Evans, her butler, had me into his buttery, and gave me sack and
a lesson on his lute, which he played very well. Thence I went to my
Lord's and got most things ready against tomorrow, as fires and laying
the cloth, and my wife was making of her tarts and larding of her
pullets till eleven o'clock. This evening Mr. Downing sent for me, and
gave me order to go to Mr. Jessop for his papers concerning his dispatch
to Holland which were not ready, only his order for a ship to transport
him he gave me. To my Lord's again and so home with my wife, tired with
this day's work.

26th. To my office for L20 to carry to Mr. Downing, which I did and back
again. Then came Mr. Frost to pay Mr. Downing his L500, and I went to
him for the warrant and brought it Mr. Frost. Called for some papers at
Whitehall for Mr. Downing, one of which was an Order of the Council for
L1800 per annum, to be paid monthly; and the other two, Orders to the
Commissioners of Customs, to let his goods pass free. Home from my
office to my Lord's lodgings where my wife had got ready a very fine
dinner--viz. a dish of marrow bones; a leg of mutton; a loin of veal;
a dish of fowl, three pullets, and two dozen of larks all in a dish; a
great tart, a neat's tongue, a dish of anchovies; a dish of prawns and
cheese. My company was my father, my uncle Fenner, his two sons, Mr.
Pierce, and all their wives, and my brother Tom. We were as merry as I
could frame myself to be in the company, W. Joyce talking after the old
rate and drinking hard, vexed his father and mother and wife. And I did
perceive that Mrs. Pierce her coming so gallant, that it put the two
young women quite out of courage. When it became dark they all went
away but Mr. Pierce, and W. Joyce, and their wives and Tom, and drank a
bottle of wine afterwards, so that Will did heartily vex his father and
mother by staying. At which I and my wife were much pleased. Then they
all went and I fell to writing of two characters for Mr. Downing, and
carried them to him at nine o'clock at night, and he did not like them
but corrected them, so that to-morrow I am to do them anew. To my Lord's
lodging again and sat by the great log, it being now a very good fire,
with my wife, and ate a bit and so home. The news this day is a letter
that speaks absolutely Monk's concurrence with this Parliament, and
nothing else, which yet I hardly believe. After dinner to-day my
father showed me a letter from my Uncle Robert, in answer to my last,
concerning my money which I would have out of my Coz. Beck's' hand,
wherein Beck desires it four months longer, which I know not how to
spare.

27th. Going to my office I met with Tom Newton, my old comrade, and took
him to the Crown in the Palace, and gave him his morning draft. And as
he always did, did talk very high what he would do with the Parliament,
that he would have what place he would, and that he might be one of the
Clerks to the Council if he would. Here I staid talking with him till
the offices were all shut, and then I looked in the Hall, and was told
by my bookseller, Mrs. Michell, that Mr. G. Montagu had inquired there
for me. So I went to his house, and was forced by him to dine with him,
and had a plenteous brave dinner and the greatest civility that ever I
had from any man. Thence home and so to Mrs. Jem, and played with her
at cards, and coming home again my wife told me that Mr. Hawly had been
there to speak with me, and seemed angry that I had not been at the
office that day, and she told me she was afraid that Mr. Downing may
have a mind to pick some hole in my coat. So I made haste to him, but
found no such thing from him, but he sent me to Mr. Sherwin's about
getting Mr. Squib to come to him tomorrow, and I carried him an answer.
So home and fell a writing the characters for Mr. Downing, and about
nine at night Mr. Hawly came, and after he was gone I sat up till almost
twelve writing, and--wrote two of them. In the morning up early and
wrote another, my wife lying in bed and reading to me.

28th. I went to Mr. Downing and carried him three characters, and then
to my office and wrote another, while Mr. Frost staid telling money. And
after I had done it Mr. Hawly came into the office and I left him and
carried it to Mr. Downing, who then told me that he was resolved to be
gone for Holland this morning. So I to my office again, and dispatch my
business there, and came with Mr. Hawly to Mr. Downing's lodging, and
took Mr. Squib from White Hall in a coach thither with me, and there we
waited in his chamber a great while, till he came in; and in the mean
time, sent all his things to the barge that lay at Charing-Cross
Stairs. Then came he in, and took a very civil leave of me, beyond my
expectation, for I was afraid that he would have told me something of
removing me from my office; but he did not, but that he would do me any
service that lay in his power. So I went down and sent a porter to my
house for my best fur cap, but he coming too late with it I did not
present it to him. Thence I went to Westminster Hall, and bound up my
cap at Mrs. Michell's, who was much taken with my cap, and endeavoured
to overtake the coach at the Exchange and to give it him there, but I
met with one that told me that he was gone, and so I returned and went
to Heaven,

     [A place of entertainment within or adjoining Westminster Hall.  It
     is called in "Hudibras," "False Heaven, at the end of the Hall."
     There were two other alehouses near Westminster Hall, called Hell
     and Purgatory.

                   "Nor break his fast
                    In Heaven and Hell."

                              Ben Jonson's Alchemist, act v.  SC. 2.]

where Luellin and I dined on a breast of mutton all alone, discoursing
of the changes that we have seen and the happiness of them that have
estates of their own, and so parted, and I went by appointment to my
office and paid young Mr. Walton L500; it being very dark he took L300
by content. He gave me half a piece and carried me in his coach to
St. Clement's, from whence I went to Mr. Crew's and made even with Mr.
Andrews, and took in all my notes and gave him one for all. Then to
my Lady Wright and gave her my Lord's letter which he bade me give her
privately. So home and then to Will's for a little news, then came home
again and wrote to my Lord, and so to Whitehall and gave them to the
post-boy. Back again home and to bed.

29th. In the morning I went to Mr. Gunning's, where he made an excellent
sermon upon the 2d of the Galatians, about the difference that fell
between St. Paul and St. Peter (the feast day of St. Paul being a day
or two ago), whereby he did prove, that, contrary to the doctrine of
the Roman Church, St. Paul did never own any dependance, or that he was
inferior to St. Peter, but that they were equal, only one a particular
charge of preaching to the Jews, and the other to the Gentiles. Here
I met with Mr. Moore, and went home with him to dinner to Mr. Crew's,
where Mr. Spurrier being in town did dine with us. From thence I went
home and spent the afternoon in casting up my accounts, and do find
myself to be worth L40 and more, which I did not think, but am afraid
that I have forgot something. To my father's to supper, where I heard by
my brother Tom how W. Joyce would the other day have Mr. Pierce and his
wife to the tavern after they were gone from my house, and that he had
so little manners as to make Tom pay his share notwithstanding that
he went upon his account, and by my father I understand that my uncle
Fenner and my aunt were much pleased with our entertaining them. After
supper home without going to see Mrs. Turner.

30th. This morning, before I was up, I fell a-singing of my song,
"Great, good, and just," &c.

     [This is the beginning of the Marquis of Montrose's verses on the
     execution of Charles I., which Pepys had set to music:

         "Great, good, and just, could I but rate
          My grief and thy too rigid fate,
          I'd weep the world to such a strain
          That it should deluge once again.
          But since thy loud-tongued blood demands supplies
          More from Briareus' hands, than Argus eyes,
          I'll sing thy obsequies with trumpet sounds,
          And write thy epitaph with blood and wounds."]

and put myself thereby in mind that this was the fatal day, now ten
years since, his Majesty died. Scull the waterman came and brought me
a note from the Hope from Mr. Hawly with direction, about his money, he
tarrying there till his master be gone. To my office, where I received
money of the excise of Mr. Ruddyer, and after we had done went to Will's
and staid there till 3 o'clock and then I taking my L12 10s. 0d. due to
me for my last quarter's salary, I went with them by water to London to
the house where Signr. Torriano used to be and staid there a while with
Mr. Ashwell, Spicer and Ruddier. Then I went and paid L12 17s. 6d. due
from me to Captn. Dick Matthews according to his direction the last week
in a letter. After that I came back by water playing on my flageolette
and not finding my wife come home again from her father's I went and sat
awhile and played at cards with Mrs. Jam, whose maid had newly got an
ague and was ill thereupon. So homewards again, having great need to
do my business, and so pretending to meet Mr. Shott the wood monger of
Whitehall I went and eased myself at the Harp and Ball, and thence home
where I sat writing till bed-time and so to bed. There seems now to be
a general cease of talk, it being taken for granted that Monk do resolve
to stand to the Parliament, and nothing else. Spent a little time this
night in knocking up nails for my hat and cloaks in my chamber.

31st. In the morning I fell to my lute till 9 o'clock. Then to my Lord's
lodgings and set out a barrel of soap to be carried to Mrs. Ann. Here I
met with Nick Bartlet, one that had been a servant of my Lord's at sea
and at Harper's gave him his morning draft. So to my office where I
paid; L1200 to Mr. Frost and at noon went to Will's to give one of the
Excise office a pot of ale that came to-day to tell over a bag of his
that wanted; L7 in it, which he found over in another bag. Then home and
dined with my wife when in came Mr. Hawly newly come from shipboard
from his master, and brought me a letter of direction what to do in
his lawsuit with Squib about his house and office. After dinner to
Westminster Hall, where all we clerks had orders to wait upon the
Committee, at the Star Chamber that is to try Colonel Jones,

     [Colonel John Jones, impeached, with General Ludlow and Miles
     Corbet, for treasonable practices in Ireland.]

and were to give an account what money we had paid him; but the
Committee did not sit to-day. Hence to Will's, where I sat an hour or
two with Mr. Godfrey Austin, a scrivener in King Street. Here I met and
afterwards bought the answer to General Monk's letter, which is a very
good one, and I keep it by me. Thence to Mrs. Jem, where I found her
maid in bed in a fit of the ague, and Mrs. Jem among the people below at
work and by and by she came up hot and merry, as if they had given her
wine, at which I was troubled, but said nothing; after a game at cards,
I went home and wrote by the post and coming back called in at Harper's
and drank with Mr. Pulford, servant to Mr. Waterhouse, who tells me,
that whereas my Lord Fleetwood should have answered to the Parliament
to-day, he wrote a letter and desired a little more time, he being a
great way out of town. And how that he is quite ashamed of himself, and
confesses how he had deserved this, for his baseness to his brother.
And that he is like to pay part of the money, paid out of the Exchequer
during the Committee of Safety, out of his own purse again, which I am
glad of. Home and to bed, leaving my wife reading in Polixandre.

     ["Polexandre," by Louis Le Roy de Gomberville, was first published
     in 1632.  "The History of Polexander" was "done into English by W.
     Browne," and published in folio, London, 1647.  It was the earliest
     of the French heroic romances, and it appears to have been the model
     for the works of Calprenede and Mdlle. de Scuderi; see Dunlop's
     "History of Fiction" for the plot of the romance.]

I could find nothing in Mr. Downing's letter, which Hawly brought me,
concerning my office; but I could discern that Hawly had a mind that I
would get to be Clerk of the Council, I suppose that he might have the
greater salary; but I think it not safe yet to change this for a public
employment.




FEBRUARY 1659-1660

February 1st. In the morning went to my office where afterwards the
old man brought me my letters from the carrier. At noon I went home and
dined with my wife on pease porridge and nothing else. After that I
went to the Hall and there met with Mr. Swan and went with him to Mr.
Downing's Counsellor, who did put me in very little hopes about the
business between Mr. Downing and Squib, and told me that Squib would
carry it against him, at which I was much troubled, and with him went
to Lincoln's Inn and there spoke with his attorney, who told me the
day that was appointed for the trial. From thence I went to Sir
Harry Wright's and got him to give me his hand for the L60 which I am
to-morrow to receive from Mr. Calthrop and from thence to Mrs. Jem and
spoke with Madam Scott and her husband who did promise to have the thing
for her neck done this week. Thence home and took Gammer East, and James
the porter, a soldier, to my Lord's lodgings, who told me how they were
drawn into the field to-day, and that they were ordered to march away
to-morrow to make room for General Monk; but they did shut their Colonel
Fitch, and the rest of the officers out of the field, and swore they
would not go without their money, and if they would not give it them,
they would go where they might have it, and that was the City. So the
Colonel went to the Parliament, and commanded what money could be got,
to be got against to-morrow for them, and all the rest of the soldiers
in town, who in all places made a mutiny this day, and do agree
together. Here I took some bedding to send to Mrs. Ann for her to lie
in now she hath her fits of the ague. Thence I went to Will's and staid
like a fool there and played at cards till 9 o'clock and so came home,
where I found Mr. Hunt and his wife who staid and sat with me till 10
and so good night.

2d. Drank at Harper's with Doling, and so to my office, where I found
all the officers of the regiments in town, waiting to receive money that
their soldiers might go out of town, and what was in the Exchequer they
had. At noon after dining at home I called at Harper's for Doling, and
he and I met with Luellin and drank with him at the Exchequer at Charing
Cross, and thence he and I went to the Temple to Mr. Calthrop's chamber,
and from thence had his man by water to London Bridge to Mr. Calthrop,
a grocer, and received L60 for my Lord. In our way we talked with our
waterman, White, who told us how the watermen had lately been abused by
some that had a desire to get in to be watermen to the State, and had
lately presented an address of nine or ten thousand hands to stand by
this Parliament, when it was only told them that it was to a petition
against hackney coaches; and that to-day they had put out another to
undeceive the world and to clear themselves, and that among the rest
Cropp, my waterman and one of great practice, was one that did cheat
them thus. After I had received the money we went to the Bridge Tavern
and drank a quart of wine and so back by water, landing Mr. Calthrop's
man at the Temple and we went homewards, but over against Somerset
House, hearing the noise of guns, we landed and found the Strand full
of soldiers. So I took my money and went to Mrs. Johnson, my Lord's
sempstress, and giving her my money to lay up, Doling and I went up
stairs to a window, and looked out and see the foot face the horse and
beat them back, and stood bawling and calling in the street for a free
Parliament and money. By and by a drum was heard to beat a march coming
towards them, and they got all ready again and faced them, and they
proved to be of the same mind with them; and so they made a great deal
of joy to see one another. After all this, I took my money, and went
home on foot and laying up my money, and changing my stockings and
shoes, I this day having left off my great skirt suit, and put on my
white suit with silver lace coat, and went over to Harper's, where I met
with W. Simons, Doling, Luellin and three merchants, one of which had
occasion to use a porter, so they sent for one, and James the soldier
came, who told us how they had been all day and night upon their guard
at St. James's, and that through the whole town they did resolve to
stand to what they had began, and that to-morrow he did believe they
would go into the City, and be received there. After all this we went to
a sport called, selling of a horse for a dish of eggs and herrings, and
sat talking there till almost twelve o'clock and then parted, they were
to go as far as Aldgate. Home and to bed.

3rd. Drank my morning draft at Harper's, and was told there that the
soldiers were all quiet upon promise of pay. Thence to St. James's Park,
and walked there to my place for my flageolet and then played a little,
it being a most pleasant morning and sunshine. Back to Whitehall, where
in the guard-chamber I saw about thirty or forty 'prentices of the
City, who were taken at twelve o'clock last night and brought prisoners
hither. Thence to my office, where I paid a little more money to some
of the soldiers under Lieut.-Col. Miller (who held out the Tower against
the Parliament after it was taken away from Fitch by the Committee of
Safety, and yet he continued in his office). About noon Mrs. Turner came
to speak with me, and Joyce, and I took them and shewed them the manner
of the Houses sitting, the doorkeeper very civilly opening the door for
us. Thence with my cozen Roger Pepys,

     [Roger Pepys, son of Talbot Pepys of Impington, a barrister of the
     Middle Temple, M.P.  for Cambridge, 1661-78, and Recorder of that
     town, 1660-88.  He married, for the third time, Parnell, daughter
     and heiress of John Duke, of Workingham, co.  Suffolk, and this was
     the wedding for which the posy ring was required.]

it being term time, we took him out of the Hall to Priors, the Rhenish
wine-house, and there had a pint or two of wine and a dish of anchovies,
and bespoke three or four dozen bottles of wine for him against his
wedding. After this done he went away, and left me order to call and
pay for all that Mrs. Turner would have. So we called for nothing more
there, but went and bespoke a shoulder of mutton at Wilkinson's to be
roasted as well as it could be done, and sent a bottle of wine home
to my house. In the meantime she and I and Joyce went walking all over
White Hall, whither General Monk was newly come, and we saw all his
forces march by in very good plight and stout officers. Thence to my
house where we dined, but with a great deal of patience, for the mutton
came in raw, and so we were fain to stay the stewing of it. In the
meantime we sat studying a Posy

     [It is supposed that the fashion of having mottoes inscribed on
     rings was of Roman origin.  In the fourteenth and fifteenth
     centuries the posy was inscribed on the outside of the ring, and in
     the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it was placed inside.  A
     small volume was published in 1674, entitled "Love's Garland: or
     Posies for Rings, Handkerchers and Gloves, and such pretty tokens
     that Lovers send their Loves."]

for a ring for her which she is to have at Roger Pepys his wedding.
After dinner I left them and went to hear news, but only found that the
Parliament House was most of them with Monk at White Hall, and that
in his passing through the town he had many calls to him for a free
Parliament, but little other welcome. I saw in the Palace Yard how
unwilling some of the old soldiers were yet to go out of town without
their money, and swore if they had it not in three days, as they were
promised, they would do them more mischief in the country than if
they had staid here; and that is very likely, the country being all
discontented. The town and guards are already full of Monk's soldiers.
I returned, and it growing dark I and they went to take a turn in the
park, where Theoph. (who was sent for to us to dinner) outran my wife
and another poor woman, that laid a pot of ale with me that she would
outrun her. After that I set them as far as Charing Cross, and there
left them and my wife, and I went to see Mrs. Ann, who began very high
about a flock bed I sent her, but I took her down. Here I played at
cards till 9 o'clock. So home and to bed.

4th. In the morning at my lute an hour, and so to my office, where I
staid expecting to have Mr. Squib come to me, but he did not. At noon
walking in the Hall I found Mr. Swan and got him and Captain Stone
together, and there advised about Mr. Downing's business. So to Will's,
and sat there till three o'clock and then to Mr. Swan's, where I found
his wife in very genteel mourning for her father, and took him out by
water to the Counsellor at the Temple, Mr. Stephens, and from thence to
Gray's Inn, thinking to speak with Sotherton Ellis, but found him not,
so we met with an acquaintance of his in the walks, and went and drank,
where I ate some bread and butter, having ate nothing all day, while
they were by chance discoursing of Marriot, the great eater, so that I
was, I remember, ashamed to eat what I would have done. Here Swan shewed
us a ballad to the tune of Mardike which was most incomparably wrote in
a printed hand, which I borrowed of him, but the song proved but silly,
and so I did not write it out. Thence we went and leaving Swan at his
master's, my Lord Widdrington, I met with Spicer, Washington, and D.
Vines in Lincoln's Inn Court, and they were buying of a hanging jack to
roast birds on of a fellow that was there selling of some. I was fain to
slip from there and went to Mrs. Crew's to her and advised about a maid
to come and be with Mrs. Jem while her maid is sick, but she could spare
none. Thence to Sir Harry Wright's, but my lady not being within I spoke
to Mrs. Carter about it, who will get one against Monday. So with a link
boy

     [Links were torches of tow or pitch to light the way.  Ed.]

to Scott's, where Mrs. Ann was in a heat, but I spoke not to her,
but told Mrs. Jem what I had done, and after that went home and wrote
letters into the country by the post, and then played awhile on my lute,
and so done, to supper and then to bed. All the news to-day is, that
the Parliament this morning voted the House to be made up four hundred
forthwith. This day my wife killed her turkeys that Mr. Sheply gave her,
that came out of Zealand with my Lord, and could not get her m'd Jane by
no means at any time to kill anything.

5th,(Lord's day). In the morning before church time Mr. Hawly, who had
for this day or two looked something sadly, which methinks did speak
something in his breast concerning me, came to me telling me that he
was out L24 which he could not tell what was become of, and that he do
remember that he had such a sum in a bag the other day, and could not
tell what he did with it, at which I was very sorry but could not
help him. In the morning to Mr. Gunning, where a stranger, an old man,
preached a good honest sermon upon "What manner of love is this that
we should be called the sons of God." After sermon I could not find my
wife, who promised to be at the gate against my coming out, and waited
there a great while; then went to my house and finding her gone I
returned and called at the Chequers, thinking to dine at the ordinary
with Mr. Chetwind and Mr. Thomas, but they not being there I went to my
father and found her there, and there I dined. To their church in the
afternoon, and in Mrs. Turner's pew my wife took up a good black hood
and kept it. A stranger preached a poor sermon, and so read over the
whole book of the story of Tobit. After sermon home with Mrs. Turner,
staid with her a little while, then she went into the court to a
christening and we to my father's, where I wrote some notes for my
brother John to give to the Mercers' to-morrow, it being the day of
their apposition. After supper home, and before going to bed I staid
writing of this day its passages, while a drum came by, beating of a
strange manner of beat, now and then a single stroke, which my wife
and I wondered at, what the meaning of it should be. This afternoon
at church I saw Dick Cumberland newly come out of the country from his
living, but did not speak to him.

6th. Before I went to my office I went to Mr. Crew's and paid Mr.
Andrews the same L60 that he had received of Mr. Calthrop the last week.
So back to Westminster and walked with him thither, where we found the
soldiers all set in the Palace Yard, to make way for General Monk to
come to the House. At the Hall we parted, and meeting Swan, he and I to
the Swan and drank our morning draft. So back again to the Hall, where
I stood upon the steps and saw Monk go by, he making observance to the
judges as he went along. At noon my father dined with me upon my turkey
that was brought from Denmark, and after dinner he and I to the Bull
Head Tavern, where we drank half a pint of wine and so parted. I to Mrs.
Ann, and Mrs. Jem being gone out of the chamber she and I had a very
high bout, I rattled her up, she being in her bed, but she becoming more
cool, we parted pretty good friends. Thence I went to Will's, where I
staid at cards till 10 o'clock, losing half a crown, and so home to bed.

7th. In the morning I went early to give Mr. Hawly notice of my being
forced to go into London, but he having also business we left our office
business to Mr. Spicer and he and I walked as far as the Temple, where
I halted a little and then went to Paul's School, but it being too soon,
went and drank my morning draft with my cozen Tom Pepys the turner, and
saw his house and shop, thence to school, where he that made the speech
for the seventh form in praise of the founder, did show a book which
Mr. Crumlum had lately got, which is believed to be of the Founder's own
writing. After all the speeches, in which my brother John came off as
well as any of the rest, I went straight home and dined, then to the
Hall, where in the Palace I saw Monk's soldiers abuse Billing and all
the Quakers, that were at a meeting-place there, and indeed the soldiers
did use them very roughly and were to blame.

     ["Fox, or some other 'weighty' friend, on hearing of this,
     complained to Monk, who issued the following order, dated March 9th:
     'I do require all officers and soldiers to forbear to disturb
     peaceable meetings of the Quakers, they doing nothing prejudicial to
     the Parliament or the Commonwealth of England.  George Monk.'  This
     order, we are told, had an excellent effect on the soldiers."--A. C.
     Bickley's 'George Fox and the Early Quakers, London, 1884, p. 179.
     The Quakers were at this time just coming into notice.  The first
     preaching of George Fox, the founder, was in 1648, and in 1655 the
     preachers of the sect numbered seventy-three.  Fox computed that
     there were seldom less than a thousand quakers in prison.  The
     statute 13 and 14 Car. II.  cap. i. (1662) was "An act for
     preventing the mischiefs and dangers that may arise by certain
     persons called quakers and others, refusing to take lawful oaths."
     Billing is mentioned again on July 22nd, 1667, when he addressed
     Pepys in Westminster Hall.]

So after drinking with Mr. Spicer, who had received L600 for me this
morning, I went to Capt. Stone and with him by coach to the Temple
Gardens (all the way talking of the disease of the stone), where we met
Mr. Squib, but would do nothing till to-morrow morning. Thence back on
foot home, where I found a letter from my Lord in character [private
cryptic code Ed.], which I construed, and after my wife had shewn me
some ribbon and shoes that she had taken out of a box of Mr. Montagu's
which formerly Mr. Kipps had left here when his master was at sea, I
went to Mr. Crew and advised with him about it, it being concerning my
Lord's coming up to Town, which he desires upon my advice the last week
in my letter. Thence calling upon Mrs. Ann I went home, and wrote in
character to my Lord in answer to his letter. This day Mr. Crew told
me that my Lord St. John is for a free Parliament, and that he is very
great with Monk, who hath now the absolute command and power to do any
thing that he hath a mind to do. Mr. Moore told me of a picture hung
up at the Exchange of a great pair of buttocks shooting of a turd into
Lawson's mouth, and over it was wrote "The thanks of the house." Boys do
now cry "Kiss my Parliament, instead of "Kiss my [rump]," so great and
general a contempt is the Rump come to among all the good and bad.

8th. A little practice on my flageolet, and afterwards walking in my
yard to see my stock of pigeons, which begin now with the spring to
breed very fast. I was called on by Mr. Fossan, my fellow pupil at
Cambridge, and I took him to the Swan in the Palace yard, and drank
together our morning draft. Thence to my office, where I received money,
and afterwards Mr. Carter, my old friend at Cambridge, meeting me as I
was going out of my office I took him to the Swan, and in the way I met
with Captain Lidcott, and so we three went together and drank there, the
Captain talking as high as ever he did, and more because of the fall of
his brother Thurlow.

     [John Thurloe, born 1616; Secretary of State to Cromwell; M.P. for
     Ely, 1656, and for the University of Cambridge in Richard Cromwell's
     Parliament of December, 1658.  He was never employed after the
     Restoration, although the King solicited his services.  He died
     February 21st, 1668.  Pepys spells the name Thurlow, which was a
     common spelling at the time.]

Hence I went to Captain Stone, who told me how Squib had been with him,
and that he could do nothing with him, so I returned to Mr. Carter and
with him to Will's, where I spent upon him and Monsieur L'Impertinent,
alias Mr. Butler, who I took thither with me, and thence to a Rhenish
wine house, and in our way met with Mr. Hoole, where I paid for my cozen
Roger Pepys his wine, and after drinking we parted. So I home, in my way
delivering a letter which among the rest I had from my Lord to-day to
Sir N. Wheeler. At home my wife's brother brought her a pretty black
dog which I liked very well, and went away again. Hence sending a porter
with the hamper of bottles to the Temple I called in my way upon Mrs.
Jem, who was much frighted till I came to tell her that her mother was
well. So to the Temple, where I delivered the wine and received the
money of my cos. Roger that I laid out, and thence to my father's, where
he shewed me a base angry letter that he had newly received from my
uncle Robert about my brother John, at which my father was very sad, but
I comforted him and wrote an answer. My brother John has an exhibition
granted him from the school. My father and I went down to his kitchen,
and there we eat and drank, and about 9 o'clock I went away homewards,
and in Fleet Street, received a great jostle from a man that had a mind
to take the wall, which I could not help?

     [This was a constant trouble to the pedestrian until the rule of
     passing to the right of the person met was generally accepted.  Gay
     commences his "Trivia" with an allusion to this--

          "When to assert the wall, and when resign--"

     and the epigram on the haughty courtier and the scholar is well
     known.]

I came home and to bed. Went to bed with my head not well by my too
much drinking to-day, and I had a boil under my chin which troubled me
cruelly.

9th. Soon as out of my bed I wrote letters into the country to go by
carrier to-day. Before I was out of my bed, I heard the soldiers very
busy in the morning, getting their horses ready where they lay at
Hilton's, but I knew not then their meaning in so doing: After I had
wrote my letters I went to Westminster up and down the Hall, and with
Mr. Swan walked a good [deal] talking about Mr. Downing's business.
I went with him to Mr. Phelps's house where he had some business to
solicit, where we met Mr. Rogers my neighbour, who did solicit against
him and talked very high, saying that he would not for a L1000 appear in
a business that Swan did, at which Swan was very angry, but I believe
he might be guilty enough. In the Hall I understand how Monk is this
morning gone into London with his army; and met with Mr. Fage, who
told me that he do believe that Monk is gone to secure some of the
Common-council of the City, who were very high yesterday there, and did
vote that they would not pay any taxes till the House was filled up.
I went to my office, where I wrote to my Lord after I had been at the
Upper Bench, where Sir Robert Pye

     [Sir Robert Pye, the elder, was auditor of the Exchequer, and a
     staunch Royalist.  He garrisoned his house at Faringdon, which was
     besieged by his son, of the same names, a decided Republican, son-
     in-law to Hampden, and colonel of horse under Fairfax.  The son,
     here spoken of, was subsequently committed to the Tower for
     presenting a petition to the House of Commons from the county of
     Berks, which he represented in Parliament, complaining of the want
     of a settled form of government.  He had, however, the courage to
     move for an habeas corpus, but judge Newdigate decided that the
     courts of law had not the power to discharge him.  Upon Monk's
     coming to London, the secluded members passed a vote to liberate
     Pye, and at the Restoration he was appointed equerry to the King.
     He died in 1701.--B.]

this morning came to desire his discharge from the Tower; but it could
not be granted. After that I went to Mrs. Jem, who I had promised to go
along with to her Aunt Wright's, but she was gone, so I went thither,
and after drinking a glass of sack I went back to Westminster Hall, and
meeting with Mr. Pierce the surgeon, who would needs take me home, where
Mr. Lucy, Burrell, and others dined, and after dinner I went home and
to Westminster Hall, where meeting Swan I went with him by water to the
Temple to our Counsel, and did give him a fee to make a motion to-morrow
in the Exchequer for Mr. Downing. Thence to Westminster Hall, where
I heard an action very finely pleaded between my Lord Dorset and some
other noble persons, his lady and other ladies of quality being here,
and it was about; L330 per annum, that was to be paid to a poor Spittal,
which was given by some of his predecessors; and given on his side.
Thence Swan and I to a drinking-house near Temple Bar, where while he
wrote I played on my flageolet till a dish of poached eggs was got ready
for us, which we eat, and so by coach home. I called at Mr. Harper's,
who told me how Monk had this day clapt up many of the Common-council,
and that the Parliament had voted that he should pull down their gates
and portcullisses, their posts and their chains, which he do intend to
do, and do lie in the City all night. I went home and got some ahlum
to my mouth, where I have the beginnings of a cancer, and had also a
plaster to my boil underneath my chin.

10th. In the morning I went to Mr. Swan, who took me to the Court of
Wards, where I saw the three Lords Commissioners sitting upon some cause
where Mr. Scobell was concerned, and my Lord Fountaine took him up
very roughly about some things that he said. After that we went to the
Exchequer, where the Barons were hearing of causes, and there I made
affidavit that Mr. Downing was gone into Holland by order of the Council
of State, and this affidavit I gave to Mr. Stevens our lawyer. Thence to
my office, where I got money of Mr. Hawly to pay the lawyer, and there
found Mr. Lenard, one of the Clerks of the Council, and took him to the
Swan and gave him his morning draft. Then home to dinner, and after that
to the Exchequer, where I heard all the afternoon a great many causes
before the Barons; in the end came ours, and Squib proved clearly by his
patent that the house and office did now belong to him. Our lawyer made
some kind of opposition, but to no purpose, and so the cause was found
against us, and the foreman of the jury brought in L10 damages, which
the whole Court cried shame of, and so he cried 12d. Thence I went home,
vexed about this business, and there I found Mr. Moore, and with him
went into London to Mr. Fage about the cancer in my mouth, which begins
to grow dangerous, who gave me something for it, and also told me what
Monk had done in the City, how he had pulled down the most part of the
gates and chains that they could break down, and that he was now gone
back to White Hall. The City look mighty blank, and cannot tell what
in the world to do; the Parliament having this day ordered that the
Common-council sit no more; but that new ones be chosen according to
what qualifications they shall give them. Thence I went and drank with
Mr. Moore at the Sugar Loaf by Temple Bar, where Swan and I were last
night, and so we parted. At home I found Mr. Hunt, who sat talking with
me awhile, and so to bed.

11th. This morning I lay long abed, and then to my office, where I read
all the morning my Spanish book of Rome. At noon I walked in the Hall,
where I heard the news of a letter from Monk, who was now gone into the
City again, and did resolve to stand for the sudden filling up of the
House, and it was very strange how the countenance of men in the Hall
was all changed with joy in half an hour's time. So I went up to the
lobby, where I saw the Speaker reading of the letter; and after it was
read, Sir A. Haselrigge came out very angry, and Billing--[The quaker
mentioned before on the 7th of this month.]--standing at the door,
took him by the arm, and cried, "Thou man, will thy beast carry thee no
longer? thou must fall!" The House presently after rose, and appointed
to meet again at three o'clock. I went then down into the Hall, where I
met with Mr. Chetwind, who had not dined no more than myself, and so we
went toward London, in our way calling at two or three shops, but could
have no dinner. At last, within Temple Bar, we found a pullet ready
roasted, and there we dined. After that he went to his office in
Chancery Lane, calling at the Rolls, where I saw the lawyers pleading.
Then to his office, where I sat in his study singing, while he was with
his man (Mr. Powell's son) looking after his business. Thence we took
coach for the City to Guildhall, where the Hall was full of people
expecting Monk and Lord Mayor to come thither, and all very joyfull.
Here we stayed a great while, and at last meeting with a friend of
his we went to the 3 Tun tavern and drank half a pint of wine, and not
liking the wine we went to an alehouse, where we met with company of
this third man's acquaintance, and there we drank a little. Hence I went
alone to Guildhall to see whether Monk was come again or no, and met
with him coming out of the chamber where he had been with the Mayor and
Aldermen, but such a shout I never heard in all my life, crying out,
"God bless your Excellence." Here I met with Mr. Lock, and took him to
an alehouse, and left him there to fetch Chetwind; when we were come
together, Lock told us the substance of the letter that went from Monk
to the Parliament; wherein, after complaints that he and his officers
were put upon such offices against the City as they could not do with
any content or honour, that there are many members now in the House that
were of the late tyrannical Committee of Safety. That Lambert and Vane
are now in town, contrary to the vote of Parliament. That there were
many in the House that do press for new oaths to be put upon men;
whereas we have more cause to be sorry for the many oaths that we have
already taken and broken. That the late petition of the fanatique people
presented by Barebone, for the imposing of an oath upon all sorts of
people, was received by the House with thanks. That therefore he [Monk]
do desire that all writs for filling up of the House be issued by Friday
next, and that in the mean time, he would retire into the City and
only leave them guards for the security of the House and Council. The
occasion of this was the order that he had last night to go into the
City and disarm them, and take away their charter; whereby he and his
officers say that the House had a mind to put them upon things that
should make them odious; and so it would be in their power to do what
they would with them. He told us that they [the Parliament] had sent
Scott and Robinson to him [Monk] this afternoon, but he would not hear
them. And that the Mayor and Aldermen had offered him their own houses
for himself and his officers; and that his soldiers would lack for
nothing. And indeed I saw many people give the soldiers drink and money,
and all along in the streets cried, "God bless them!" and extraordinary
good words. Hence we went to a merchant's house hard by, where Lock
wrote a note and left, where I saw Sir Nich. Crisp, and so we went to
the Star Tavern (Monk being then at Benson's), where we dined and I
wrote a letter to my Lord from thence. In Cheapside there was a great
many bonfires, and Bow bells and all the bells in all the churches as
we went home were a-ringing. Hence we went homewards, it being about ten
o'clock. But the common joy that was every where to be seen! The number
of bonfires, there being fourteen between St. Dunstan's and Temple Bar,
and at Strand Bridge' I could at one view tell thirty-one fires. In
King-street seven or eight; and all along burning, and roasting, and
drinking for rumps. There being rumps tied upon sticks and carried up
and down. The butchers at the May Pole in the Strand rang a peal with
their knives when they were going to sacrifice their rump. On Ludgate
Hill there was one turning of the spit that had a rump tied upon it,
and another basting of it. Indeed it was past imagination, both the
greatness and the suddenness of it. At one end of the street you would
think there was a whole lane of fire, and so hot that we were fain to
keep still on the further side merely for heat. We came to the Chequers
at Charing Cross, where Chetwind wrote a letter and I gave him an
account of what I had wrote for him to write. Thence home and sent my
letters to the posthouse in London, and my wife and I (after Mr. Hunt
was gone, whom I found waiting at my house) went out again to show her
the fires, and after walking as far as the Exchange we returned and to
bed.

12th. In the morning, it being Lord's day, Mr. Pierce came to me to
enquire how things go. We drank our morning draft together and thence
to White Hall, where Dr. Hones preached; but I staid not to hear, but
walking in the court, I heard that Sir Arth. Haselrigge was newly gone
into the City to Monk, and that Monk's wife removed from White Hall last
night. Home again, where at noon came according to my invitation my cos.
Thos. Pepys and his partner and dined with me, but before dinner we went
and took a walk round the park, it being a most pleasant day as ever I
saw. After dinner we three went into London together, where I heard that
Monk had been at Paul's in the morning, and the people had shouted much
at his coming out of the church. In the afternoon he was at a church in
Broad-street, whereabout he do lodge. But not knowing how to see him we
went and walked half a hour in Moorfields, which were full of people, it
being so fine a day. Here I took leave of them, and so to Paul's, where
I met with Mr. Kirton's' apprentice (the crooked fellow) and walked
up and down with him two hours, sometimes in the street looking for a
tavern to drink in, but not finding any open, we durst not knock; other
times in the churchyard, where one told me that he had seen the letter
printed. Thence to Mr. Turner's, where I found my wife, Mr. Edw. Pepys,
and Roger' and Mr. Armiger being there, to whom I gave as good an
account of things as I could, and so to my father's, where Charles
Glascocke was overjoyed to see how things are now; who told me the boys
had last night broke Barebone's windows. Hence home, and being near home
we missed our maid, and were at a great loss and went back a great way
to find her, but when we could not see her we went homewards and found
her there, got before us which we wondered at greatly. So to bed, where
my wife and I had some high words upon my telling her that I would fling
the dog which her brother gave her out of window if he [dirtied] the
house any more.

13th. To my office till noon, thence home to dinner, my mouth being
very bad of the cancer and my left leg beginning to be sore again. After
dinner to see Mrs. Jem, and in the way met with Catan on foot in the
street and talked with her a little, so home and took my wife to my
father's. In my way I went to Playford's, and for two books that I had
and 6s. 6d. to boot I had my great book of songs which he sells always
for r 4s. At my father's I staid a while, while my mother sent her maid
Bess to Cheapside for some herbs to make a water for my mouth. Then I
went to see Mr. Cumberland, and after a little stay with him I returned,
and took my wife home, where after supper to bed. This day Monk was
invited to White Hall to dinner by my Lords; not seeming willing, he
would not come. I went to Mr. Fage from my father's, who had been this
afternoon with Monk, who do promise to live and die with the City, and
for the honour of the City; and indeed the City is very open-handed to
the soldiers, that they are most of them drunk all day, and have money
given them. He did give me something for my mouth which I did use this
night.

14th. Called out in the morning by Mr. Moore, whose voice my wife
hearing in my dressing-chamber with me, got herself ready, and came down
and challenged him for her valentine, this being the day.

     [The practice of choosing valentines was very general at this time,
     but some of the best examples of the custom are found in this
     Diary.]

To Westminster Hall, there being many new remonstrances and declarations
from many counties to Monk and the City, and one coming from the North
from Sir Thomas Fairfax. Hence I took him to the Swan and gave him his
morning draft. So to my office, where Mr. Hill of Worcestershire came
to see me and my partner in our office, with whom we went to Will's to
drink. At noon I went home and so to Mr. Crew's, but they had dined, and
so I went to see Mrs. Jem where I stayed a while, and home again where
I stayed an hour or two at my lute, and so forth to Westminster Hall,
where I heard that the Parliament hath now changed the oath so much
talked of to a promise; and that among other qualifications for the
members that are to be chosen, one is, that no man, nor the son of
any man that hath been in arms during the life of the father, shall be
capable of being chosen to sit in Parliament. To Will's, where like a
fool I staid and lost 6d. at cards. So home, and wrote a letter to my
Lord by the post. So after supper to bed. This day, by an order of the
House, Sir H. Vane was sent out of town to his house in Lincolnshire.

15th. Called up in the morning by Captain Holland and Captain Cuttance,
and with them to Harper's, thence to my office, thence with Mr. Hill of
Worcestershire to Will's, where I gave him a letter to Nan Pepys, and
some merry pamphlets against the Rump to carry to her into the country.
So to Mr. Crew's, where the dining room being full, Mr. Walgrave and
I dined below in the buttery by ourselves upon a good dish of buttered
salmon. Thence to Hering' the merchant about my Lord's Worcester money
and back to Paul's Churchyard, where I staid reading in Fuller's History
of the Church of England an hour or two, and so to my father's, where
Mr. Hill came to me and I gave him direction what to do at Worcester
about the money. Thence to my Lady Wright's and gave her a letter from
my Lord privily. So to Mrs. Jem and sat with her, who dined at Mr.
Crew's to-day, and told me that there was at her coming away at least
forty gentlemen (I suppose members that were secluded, for Mr. Walgrave
told me that there were about thirty met there the last night) came
dropping in one after another thither. Thence home and wrote into the
country against to-morrow by the carrier and so to bed. At my father's
I heard how my cousin Kate Joyce had a fall yesterday from her horse
and had some hurt thereby. No news to-day, but all quiet to see what the
Parliament will do about the issuing of the writs to-morrow for filling
up of the House, according to Monk's desire.

16th, In the morning at my lute. Then came Shaw and Hawly, and I gave
them their morning draft at my house. So to my office, where I wrote by
the carrier to my Lord and sealed my letter at Will's, and gave it old
East to carry it to the carrier's, and to take up a box of china oranges
and two little barrels of scallops at my house, which Captain Cuttance
sent to me for my Lord. Here I met with Osborne and with Shaw and
Spicer, and we went to the Sun Tavern in expectation of a dinner, where
we had sent us only two trenchers-full of meat, at which we were very
merry, while in came Mr. Wade and his friend Capt. Moyse (who told us
of his hopes to get an estate merely for his name's sake), and here we
staid till seven at night, I winning a quart of sack of Shaw that one
trencherfull that was sent us was all lamb and he that it was veal. I
by having but 3d. in my pocket made shift to spend no more, whereas if
I had had more I had spent more as the rest did, so that I see it is
an advantage to a man to carry little in his pocket. Home, and after
supper, and a little at my flute, I went to bed.

17th. In the morning Tom that was my Lord's footboy came to see me and
had 10s. of me of the money which I have to keep of his. So that now I
have but 35s. more of his. Then came Mr. Hills the instrument maker, and
I consulted with him about the altering my lute and my viall. After that
I went into my study and did up my accounts, and found that I am about;
L40 beforehand in the world, and that is all. So to my office and from
thence brought Mr. Hawly home with me to dinner, and after dinner wrote
a letter to Mr. Downing about his business and gave it Hawly, and so
went to Mr. Gunning's to his weekly fast, and after sermon, meeting
there with Monsieur L'Impertinent, we went and walked in the park till
it was dark. I played on my pipe at the Echo, and then drank a cup of
ale at Jacob's. So to Westminster Hall, and he with me, where I heard
that some of the members of the House were gone to meet with some of the
secluded members and General Monk in the City. Hence we went to White
Hall, thinking to hear more news, where I met with Mr. Hunt, who told me
how Monk had sent for all his goods that he had here into the City; and
yet again he told me, that some of the members of the House had this day
laid in firing into their lodgings at White Hall for a good while,
so that we are at a great stand to think what will become of
things, whether Monk will stand to the Parliament or no. Hence Mons.
L'Impertinent and I to Harper's, and there drank a cup or two to the
King, and to his fair sister Frances--[Frances Butler, the great beauty,
who is sometimes styled. la belle Boteler.]--good health, of whom we had
much discourse of her not being much the worse for the small pox, which
she had this last summer. So home and to bed. This day we are invited to
my uncle Fenner's wedding feast, but went not, this being the 27th year.

18th. A great while at my vial and voice, learning to sing "Fly boy, fly
boy," without book. So to my office, where little to do. In the Hall I
met with Mr. Eglin and one Looker, a famous gardener, servant to my Lord
Salsbury, and among other things the gardener told a strange passage in
good earnest.... Home to dinner, and then went to my Lord's lodgings to
my turret there and took away most of my books, and sent them home by
my maid. Thither came Capt. Holland to me who took me to the Half Moon
tavern and Mr. Southorne, Blackburne's clerk. Thence he took me to the
Mitre in Fleet Street, where we heard (in a room over the music room)
very plainly through the ceiling. Here we parted and I to Mr. Wotton's,
and with him to an alehouse and drank while he told me a great many
stories of comedies that he had formerly seen acted, and the names of
the principal actors, and gave me a very good account of it. Thence to
Whitehall, where I met with Luellin and in the clerk's chamber wrote a
letter to my Lord. So home and to bed. This day two soldiers were hanged
in the Strand for their late mutiny at Somerset-house.

19th (Lord's day). Early in the morning I set my books that I brought
home yesterday up in order in my study. Thence forth to Mr. Harper's to
drink a draft of purle,--[Purl is hot beer flavoured with wormwood or
other aromatic herbs. The name is also given to hot beer flavoured with
gin, sugar, and ginger.]--whither by appointment Monsieur L'Impertinent,
who did intend too upon my desire to go along with me to St.
Bartholomew's, to hear one Mr. Sparks, but it raining very hard we went
to Mr. Gunning's and heard an excellent sermon, and speaking of the
character that the Scripture gives of Ann the mother of the blessed
Virgin, he did there speak largely in commendation of widowhood, and
not as we do to marry two or three wives or husbands, one after another.
Here I met with Mr. Moore, and went home with him to dinner, where he
told me the discourse that happened between the secluded members and the
members of the House, before Monk last Friday. How the secluded said,
that they did not intend by coming in to express revenge upon these men,
but only to meet and dissolve themselves, and only to issue writs for a
free Parliament. He told me how Haselrigge was afraid to have the candle
carried before him, for fear that the people seeing him, would do him
hurt; and that he is afraid to appear in the City. That there is great
likelihood that the secluded members will come in, and so Mr. Crew and
my Lord are likely to be great men, at which I was very glad. After
diner there was many secluded members come in to Mr. Crew, which,
it being the Lord's day, did make Mr. Moore believe that there was
something extraordinary in the business. Hence home and brought my wife
to Mr. Mossum's to hear him, and indeed he made a very good sermon, but
only too eloquent for a pulpit. Here Mr. L'Impertinent helped me to a
seat. After sermon to my father's; and fell in discourse concerning our
going to Cambridge the next week with my brother John. To Mrs. Turner
where her brother, Mr. Edward Pepys, was there, and I sat a great while
talking of public business of the times with him. So to supper to my
Father's, all supper talking of John's going to Cambridge. So home, and
it raining my wife got my mother's French mantle and my brother John's
hat, and so we went all along home and to bed.

20th. In the morning at my lute. Then to my office, where my partner
and I made even our balance. Took him home to dinner with me, where my
brother John came to dine with me. After dinner I took him to my study
at home and at my Lord's, and gave him some books and other things
against his going to Cambridge. After he was gone I went forth to
Westminster Hall, where I met with Chetwind, Simons, and Gregory. And
with them to Marsh's at Whitehall to drink, and staid there a pretty
while reading a pamphlet well writ and directed to General Monk, in
praise of the form of monarchy which was settled here before the wars.

     [This pamphlet is among the Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts
     (British Museum), and dated in MS.  this same day, February 20th--
     "A Plea for Limited Monarchy as it was established in this Nation
     before the late War.  In an Humble Address to his Excellency General
     Monck.  By a Zealot for the good old Laws of his Country, before any
     Faction or Caprice, with additions."  "An Eccho to the Plea for
     Limited Monarchy, &c.," was published soon afterwards.]

They told me how the Speaker Lenthall do refuse to sign the writs for
choice of new members in the place of the excluded; and by that means
the writs could not go out to-day. In the evening Simons and I to the
Coffee Club, where nothing to do only I heard Mr. Harrington, and my
Lord of Dorset and another Lord, talking of getting another place as the
Cockpit, and they did believe it would come to something. After a small
debate upon the question whether learned or unlearned subjects are the
best the Club broke up very poorly, and I do not think they will meet
any more. Hence with Vines, &c. to Will's, and after a pot or two home,
and so to bed.

21st. In the morning going out I saw many soldiers going towards
Westminster, and was told that they were going to admit the secluded
members again. So I to Westminster Hall, and in Chancery Row I saw about
twenty of them who had been at White Hall with General Monk, who came
thither this morning, and made a speech to them, and recommended to them
a Commonwealth, and against Charles Stuart. They came to the House and
went in one after another, and at last the Speaker came. But it is very
strange that this could be carried so private, that the other members of
the House heard nothing of all this, till they found them in the House,
insomuch that the soldiers that stood there to let in the secluded
members, they took for such as they had ordered to stand there to hinder
their coming in. Mr. Prin came with an old basket-hilt sword on, and had
a great many great shouts upon his going into the Hall. They sat till
noon, and at their coming out Mr. Crew saw me, and bid me come to his
house, which I did, and he would have me dine with him, which I did; and
he very joyful told me that the House had made General Monk, General of
all the Forces in England, Scotland, and Ireland; and that upon Monk's
desire, for the service that Lawson had lately done in pulling down the
Committee of Safety, he had the command of the Sea for the time being.
He advised me to send for my Lord forthwith, and told me that there is
no question that, if he will, he may now be employed again; and that the
House do intend to do nothing more than to issue writs, and to settle
a foundation for a free Parliament. After dinner I back to Westminster
Hall with him in his coach. Here I met with Mr. Lock and Pursell,
Masters of Music,--[Henry Purcell, father of the celebrated composer,
was gentleman of the Chapel Royal.]--and with them to the Coffee House,
into a room next the water, by ourselves, where we spent an hour or two
till Captain Taylor came to us, who told us, that the House had voted
the gates of the City to be made up again, and the members of the City
that are in prison to be set at liberty; and that Sir G. Booth's'
case be brought into the House to-morrow. Here we had variety of brave
Italian and Spanish songs, and a canon for eight voices, which Mr. Lock
had lately made on these words: "Domine salvum fac Regem," an admirable
thing. Here also Capt. Taylor began a discourse of something that he had
lately writ about Gavelkind in answer to one that had wrote a piece
upon the same subject; and indeed discovered a great deal of study
in antiquity in his discourse. Here out of the window it was a most
pleasant sight to see the City from one end to the other with a glory
about it, so high was the light of the bonfires, and so thick round the
City, and the bells rang everywhere. Hence home and wrote to my Lord,
afterwards came down and found Mr. Hunt (troubled at this change) and
Mr. Spong, who staid late with me singing of a song or two, and so
parted. My wife not very well, went to bed before. This morning I met in
the Hall with Mr. Fuller, of Christ's, and told him of my design to
go to Cambridge, and whither. He told me very freely the temper of Mr.
Widdrington, how he did oppose all the fellows in the College, and that
there was a great distance between him and the rest, at which I was very
sorry, for that he told me he feared it would be little to my brother's
advantage to be his pupil.

22nd. In the morning intended to have gone to Mr. Crew's to borrow some
money, but it raining I forbore, and went to my Lord's lodging and look
that all things were well there. Then home and sang a song to my viall,
so to my office and to Will's, where Mr. Pierce found me out, and told
me that he would go with me to Cambridge, where Colonel Ayre's regiment,
to which he was surgeon, lieth. Walking in the Hall, I saw Major-General
Brown, who had along time been banished by the Rump, but now with his
beard overgrown, he comes abroad and sat in the House. To my father's
to dinner, where nothing but a small dish of powdered beef--[Boiled
salt beef. To powder was to sprinkle with salt, and the powdering tub a
vessel in which meat was salted.]--and dish of carrots; they being all
busy to get things ready for my brother John to go to-morrow. After
dinner, my wife staying there, I went to Mr. Crew's, and got; L5 of Mr.
Andrews, and so to Mrs. Jemimah, who now hath her instrument about her
neck, and indeed is infinitely, altered, and holds her head upright. I
paid her, maid 40s. of the money that I have received of Mr. Andrews.
Hence home to my study, where I only wrote thus much of this day's
passages to this * and so out again. To White Hall, where I met with
Will. Simons and Mr. Mabbot at Marsh's, who told me how the House had
this day voted that the gates of the City should be set up at the cost
of the State. And that Major-General Brown's being proclaimed a traitor
be made void, and several other things of that nature. Home for my
lanthorn and so to my father's, where I directed John what books to put
for Cambridge. After that to supper, where my Uncle Fenner and my Aunt,
The. Turner, and Joyce, at a brave leg of veal roasted, and were
very merry against John's going to Cambridge. I observed this day how
abominably Barebone's windows are broke again last night. At past 9
o'clock my wife and I went home.

23rd. Thursday, my birthday, now twenty-seven years. A pretty fair
morning, I rose and after writing a while in my study I went forth.
To my office, where I told Mr. Hawly of my thoughts to go out of town
to-morrow. Hither Mr. Fuller comes to me and my Uncle Thomas too, thence
I took them to drink, and so put off my uncle. So with Mr. Fuller home
to my house, where he dined with me, and he told my wife and me a great
many stories of his adversities, since these troubles, in being forced
to travel in the Catholic countries, &c. He shewed me his bills, but I
had not money to pay him. We parted, and I to Whitehall, where I was to
see my horse which Mr. Garthwayt lends me to-morrow. So home, where Mr.
Pierce comes to me about appointing time and place where and when to
meet tomorrow. So to Westminster Hall, where, after the House rose, I
met with Mr. Crew, who told me that my Lord was chosen by 73 voices,
to be one of the Council of State. Mr. Pierpoint had the most, 101,
and himself the next, too. He brought me in the coach home. He and Mr.
Anslow being in it. I back to the Hall, and at Mrs. Michell's shop staid
talking a great while with her and my Chaplain, Mr. Mumford, and drank
a pot or two of ale on a wager that Mr. Prin is not of the Council. Home
and wrote to my Lord the news of the choice of the Council by the post,
and so to bed.

24th. I rose very early, and taking horse at Scotland Yard, at Mr.
Garthwayt's stable, I rode to Mr. Pierces, who rose, and in a quarter of
an hour, leaving his wife in bed (with whom Mr. Lucy methought was very
free as she lay in bed), we both mounted, and so set forth about seven
of the clock, the day and the way very foul. About Ware we overtook Mr.
Blayton, brother-in-law to Dick Vines, who went thenceforwards with us,
and at Puckeridge we baited, where we had a loin of mutton fried, and
were very merry, but the way exceeding bad from Ware thither. Then up
again and as far as Foulmer, within six miles of Cambridge, my mare
being almost tired: here we lay at the Chequer, playing at cards till
supper, which was a breast of veal roasted. I lay with Mr. Pierce, who
we left here the next morning upon his going to Hinchingbroke to speak
with my Lord before his going to London, and we two come to Cambridge by
eight o'clock in the morning.

25th. To the Falcon, in the Petty Cury,

     [The old Falcon Inn is on the south side of Petty Cury.  It is now
     divided into three houses, one of which is the present Falcon Inn,
     the other two being houses with shops.  The Falcon yard is but
     little changed.  From the size of the whole building it must have
     been the principal inn of the town.  The room said to have been used
     by Queen Elizabeth for receptions retains its original form.--M. B.

     The Petty Cury.  The derivation of the name of this street, so well
     known to all Cambridge men, is a matter of much dispute among
     antiquaries.  (See "Notes and Queries.") The most probable meaning
     of it is the Parva Cokeria, or little cury, where the cooks of the
     town lived, just as "The Poultry," where the Poulters (now
     Poulterers) had their shops.  "The Forme of Cury," a Roll of Antient
     English Cookery, was compiled by the principal cooks of that "best
     and royalest viander of all Christian Kings," Richard the Second,
     and edited with a copious Index and Glossary by Dr. Samuel Pegge,
     1780.--M. B.]

where we found my father and brother very well. After dressing myself,
about ten o'clock, my father, brother, and I to Mr. Widdririgton, at
Christ's College, who received us very civilly, and caused my brother to
be admitted, while my father, he, and I, sat talking. After that
done, we take leave. My father and brother went to visit some friends,
Pepys's, scholars in Cambridge, while I went to Magdalene College, to
Mr. Hill, with whom I found Mr. Zanchy, Burton, and Hollins, and was
exceeding civilly received by them. I took leave on promise to sup with
them, and to my Inn again, where I dined with some others that were
there at an ordinary. After dinner my brother to the College, and my
father and I to my Cozen Angier's, to see them, where Mr. Fairbrother
came to us. Here we sat a while talking. My father he went to look
after his things at the carrier's, and my brother's chamber, while Mr.
Fairbrother, my Cozen Angier, and Mr. Zanchy, whom I met at Mr. Merton's
shop (where I bought 'Elenchus Motuum', having given my former to Mr.
Downing when he was here), to the Three Tuns, where we drank pretty hard
and many healths to the King, &c., till it began to be darkish: then we
broke up and I and Mr. Zanchy went to Magdalene College, where a very
handsome supper at Mr. Hill's chambers, I suppose upon a club among
them, where in their discourse I could find that there was nothing
at all left of the old preciseness in their discourse, specially on
Saturday nights. And Mr. Zanchy told me that there was no such thing
now-a-days among them at any time. After supper and some discourse
then to my Inn, where I found my father in his chamber, and after some
discourse, and he well satisfied with this day's work, we went to bed,
my brother lying with me, his things not being come by the carrier that
he could not lie in the College.

26th (Sunday). My brother went to the College to Chapel. My father and
I went out in the morning, and walked out in the fields behind King's
College, and in King's College Chapel Yard, where we met with Mr.
Fairbrother, who took us to Botolph's Church, where we heard Mr.
Nicholas, of Queen's College, who I knew in my time to be Tripos,

     [The Tripos or Bachelor of the Stool, who made the speech on Ash
     Wednesday, when the senior Proctor called him up and exhorted him to
     be witty but modest withal.  Their speeches, especially after the
     Restoration, tended to be boisterous, and even scurrilous.
     "26 Martii 1669.  Da Hollis, fellow of Clare Hall is to make a
     publick Recantation in the Bac. Schools for his Tripos speeche."
     The Tripos verses still come out, and are circulated on Ash
     Wednesday.  The list of successful candidates for honours is printed
     on the same paper, hence the term "Tripos" applied to it.]

with great applause, upon this text, "For thy commandments are broad."
Thence my father and I to Mr. Widdrington's chamber to dinner, where he
used us very courteously again, and had two Fellow Commoners at table
with him, and Mr. Pepper, a Fellow of the College. After dinner, while
we sat talking by the fire, Mr. Pierces man came to tell me that his
master was come to town, so my father and I took leave, and found Mr.
Pierce at our Inn, who told us that he had lost his journey, for my Lord
was gone from Hinchingbroke to London on Thursday last, at which I was
a little put to a stand. So after a cup of drink I went to Magdalene
College to get the certificate of the College for my brother's entrance
there, that he might save his year. I met with Mr. Burton in the Court,
who took me to Mr. Pechell's chamber, where he was and Mr. Zanchy. By
and by, Mr. Pechell and Sanchy and I went out, Pechell to Church, Sanchy
and I to the Rose Tavern, where we sat and drank till sermon done, and
then Mr. Pechell came to us, and we three sat drinking the King's and
his whole family's health till it began to be dark. Then we parted;
Sanchy and I went to my lodging, where we found my father and Mr. Pierce
at the door, and I took them both and Mr. Blayton to the Rose Tavern,
and there gave them a quart or two of wine, not telling them that we had
been there before. After this we broke up, and my father, Mr. Zanchy,
and I to my Cosen Angier to supper, where I caused two bottles of wine
to be carried from the Rose Tavern; that was drunk up, and I had not the
wit to let them know at table that it was I that paid for them, and so I
lost my thanks for them. After supper Mr. Fairbrother, who supped there
with us, took me into a room by himself, and shewed me a pitiful copy
of verses upon Mr. Prinn which he esteemed very good, and desired that
I would get them given to Mr. Prinn, in hopes that he would get him some
place for it, which I said I would do, but did laugh in my sleeve to
think of his folly, though indeed a man that has always expressed great
civility to me. After that we sat down and talked; I took leave of
all my friends, and so to my Inn, where after I had wrote a note and
enclosed the certificate to Mr. Widdrington, I bade good night to my
father, and John went to bed, but I staid up a little while, playing the
fool with the lass of the house at the door of the chamber, and so to
bed.

27th. Up by four o'clock, and after I was ready, took my leave of my
father, whom I left in bed, and the same of my brother John, to whom I
gave 10s. Mr. Blayton and I took horse and straight to Saffron Walden,
where at the White Hart, we set up our horses, and took the master of
the house to shew us Audley End House, who took us on foot through
the park, and so to the house, where the housekeeper shewed us all the
house, in which the stateliness of the ceilings, chimney-pieces, and
form of the whole was exceedingly worth seeing. He took us into the
cellar, where we drank most admirable drink, a health to the King. Here
I played on my flageolette, there being an excellent echo. He shewed us
excellent pictures; two especially, those of the four Evangelists and
Henry VIII. After that I gave the man 2s. for his trouble, and went back
again. In our going, my landlord carried us through a very old hospital
or almshouse, where forty poor people was maintained; a very old
foundation; and over the chimney in the mantelpiece was an inscription
in brass: "Orate pre anima Thomae Bird," &c.; and the poor box also was
on the same chimney-piece, with an iron door and locks to it, into which
I put 6d. They brought me a draft of their drink in a brown bowl, tipt
with silver, which I drank off, and at the bottom was a picture of the
Virgin and the child in her arms, done in silver. So we went to our Inn,
and after eating of something, and kissed the daughter of the house,
she being very pretty, we took leave, and so that night, the road pretty
good, but the weather rainy to Ep[p]ing, where we sat and played a game
at cards, and after supper, and some merry talk with a plain bold maid
of the house, we went to bed.

28th. Up in the morning, and had some red herrings to our breakfast,
while my boot-heel was a-mending, by the same token the boy left the
hole as big as it was before. Then to horse, and for London through the
forest, where we found the way good, but only in one path, which we kept
as if we had rode through a canal all the way. We found the shops all
shut, and the militia of the red regiment in arms at the Old Exchange,
among whom I found and spoke to Nich. Osborne, who told me that it was
a thanksgiving-day through the City for the return of the Parliament.
At Paul's I light, Mr. Blayton holding my horse, where I found Dr.
Reynolds' in the pulpit, and General Monk there, who was to have a great
entertainment at Grocers' Hall. So home, where my wife and all well.
Shifted myself,--[Changed his dress.]--and so to Mr. Crew's, and then to
Sir Harry Wright's, where I found my Lord at dinner, who called for me
in, and was glad to see me. There was at dinner also Mr. John Wright and
his lady, a very pretty lady, Alderman Allen's daughter. I dined
here with Will. Howe, and after dinner went out with him to buy a hat
(calling in my way and saw my mother), which we did at the Plough in
Fleet Street by my Lord's direction, but not as for him. Here we met
with Mr. Pierce a little before, and he took us to the Greyhound Tavern,
and gave us a pint of wine, and as the rest of the seamen do, talked
very high again of my Lord. After we had done about the hat we went
homewards, he to Mr. Crew's and I to Mrs. Jem, and sat with her a
little. Then home, where I found Mr. Sheply, almost drunk, come to see
me, afterwards Mr. Spong comes, with whom I went up and played with him
a Duo or two, and so good night. I was indeed a little vexed with Mr.
Sheply, but said nothing, about his breaking open of my study at my
house, merely to give him the key of the stair door at my Lord's, which
lock he might better have broke than mine.

29th. To my office, and drank at Will's with Mr. Moore, who told me how
my Lord is chosen General at Sea by the Council, and that it is thought
that Monk will be joined with him therein. Home and dined, after dinner
my wife and I by water to London, and thence to Herring's, the merchant
in Coleman Street, about L50 which he promises I shall have on Saturday
next. So to my mother's, and then to Mrs. Turner's, of whom I took
leave, and her company, because she was to go out of town to-morrow
with Mr. Pepys into Norfolk. Here my cosen Norton gave me a brave cup of
metheglin,

     [A liquor made of honey and water, boiled and fermenting.  By 12
     Charles II.  cap. 23, a grant of certain impositions upon beer, ale,
     and other liquors, a duty of 1d.  per gallon was laid upon "all
     metheglin or mead."]

the first I ever drank. To my mother's and supped there.

She shewed me a letter to my father from my uncle inviting him to come
to Brampton while he is in the country. So home and to bed. This day my
Lord came to the House, the first time since he came to town; but he had
been at the Council before.




MARCH 1659-1660

March 1st. In the morning went to my Lord's lodgings, thinking to have
spoke with Mr. Sheply, having not been to visit him since my coming to
town. But he being not within I went up, and out of the box where my
Lord's pamphlets lay, I chose as many as I had a mind to have for my own
use and left the rest. Then to my office, where little to do, abut
Mr. Sheply comes to me, so at dinner time he and I went to Mr. Crew's,
whither Mr. Thomas was newly come to town, being sent with Sir H.
Yelverton, a my old school-fellow at Paul's School, to bring the thanks
of the county to General Monk for the return of the Parliament. But old
Mr. Crew and my Lord not coming home to dinner, we tarried late before
we went to dinner, it being the day that John, Mr. John Crew's coachman,
was to be buried in the afternoon, he being a day or two before killed
with a blow of one of his horses that struck his skull into his brain.
From thence Mr. Sheply and I went into London to Mr. Laxton's; my Lord's
apothecary, and so by water to Westminster, where at the Sun [tavern] he
and I spent two or three hours in a pint or two of wine, discoursing of
matters in the country, among other things telling me that my uncle
did to him make a very kind mention of me, and what he would do for me.
Thence I went home, and went to bed betimes. This day the Parliament did
vote that they would not sit longer than the 15th day of this month.

2d. This morning I went early to my Lord at Mr. Crew's, where I spoke to
him. Here were a great many come to see him, as Secretary Thurlow who is
now by this Parliament chosen again Secretary of State. There were also
General Monk's trumpeters to give my Lord a sound of their trumpets this
morning. Thence I went to my office, and wrote a letter to Mr. Downing
about the business of his house. Then going home, I met with Mr. Eglin,
Chetwind, and Thomas, who took me to the Leg [another tavern] in King's
street, where we had two brave dishes of meat, one of fish, a carp and
some other fishes, as well done as ever I ate any. After that to the
Swan tavern, where we drank a quart or two of wine, and so parted. So
I to Mrs. Jem and took Mr. Moore with me (who I met in the street), and
there I met W. Howe and Sheply. After that to Westminster Hall, where
I saw Sir G. Booth at liberty. This day I hear the City militia is put
into good posture, and it is thought that Monk will not be able to do
any great matter against them now, if he have a mind. I understand that
my Lord Lambert did yesterday send a letter to the Council, and that
to-night he is to come and appear to the Council in person. Sir Arthur
Haselrigge do not yet appear in the House. Great is the talk of a
single person, and that it would now be Charles, George, or Richard
again.--[Charles II., or George Monk, or Richard Cromwell.]--For the
last of which, my Lord St. John is said to speak high. Great also is the
dispute now in the House, in whose name the writs shall run for the next
Parliament; and it is said that Mr. Prin, in open House, said, "In King
Charles's." From Westminster Hall home. Spent the evening in my study,
and so after some talk with my wife, then to bed.

3d. To Westminster Hall, where I found that my Lord was last night voted
one of the Generals at Sea, and Monk the other. I met my Lord in the
Hall, who bid me come to him at noon. I met with Mr. Pierce the purser,
Lieut. Lambert, Mr. Creed, and Will. Howe, and went with them to the
Swan tavern. Up to my office, but did nothing. At noon home to dinner to
a sheep's head. My brother Tom came and dined with me, and told me that
my mother was not very well, and that my Aunt Fenner was very ill too.
After dinner I to Warwick House, in Holborn, to my Lord, where he dined
with my Lord of Manchester, Sir Dudley North, my Lord Fiennes, and my
Lord Barkly. I staid in the great hall, talking with some gentlemen
there, till they all come out. Then I, by coach with my Lord, to Mr.
Crew's, in our way talking of publick things, and how I should look
after getting of his Commissioner's despatch. He told me he feared there
was new design hatching, as if Monk had a mind to get into the saddle.
Here I left him, and went by appointment to Hering, the merchant, but
missed of my money, at which I was much troubled, but could not help
myself. Returning, met Mr. Gifford, who took me and gave me half a pint
of wine, and told me, as I hear this day from many, that things are in a
very doubtful posture, some of the Parliament being willing to keep the
power in their hands. After I had left him, I met with Tom Harper,
who took me into a place in Drury Lane, where we drank a great deal
of strong water, more than ever I did in my life at onetime before. He
talked huge high that my Lord Protector would come in place again, which
indeed is much discoursed of again, though I do not see it possible.
Hence home and wrote to my father at Brampton by the post. So to bed.
This day I was told that my Lord General Fleetwood told my lord that he
feared the King of Sweden is dead of a fever at Gottenburg.

4th. Lord's day. Before I went to church I sang Orpheus' Hymn to my
viall. After that to Mr. Gunning's, an excellent sermon upon charity.
Then to my mother to dinner, where my wife and the maid were come. After
dinner we three to Mr. Messum's where we met Mons. L'Impertinent, who
got us a seat and told me a ridiculous story how that last week he had
caused a simple citizen to spend; L80 in entertainments of him and some
friends of his upon pretence of some service that he would do him in his
suit after a widow. Then to my mother again, and after supper she and I
talked very high about religion, I in defence of the religion I was born
in. Then home.

5th. Early in the morning Mr. Hill comes to string my theorbo,

     [The theorbo was a bass lute.  Having gut strings it was played with
     the fingers.  There is a humorous comparison of the long waists of
     ladies, which came into fashion about 1621, with the theorbo, by
     Bishop Corbet:

         "She was barr'd up in whale-bones, that did leese
          None of the whale's length, for they reached her knees;
          Off with her head, and then she hath a middle
          As her waste stands, just like the new found fiddle,
          The favourite Theorbo, truth to tell ye,
          Whose neck and throat are deeper than the belly."

                                   Corbet, 'Iter Boreale'.]

which we were about till past ten o'clock, with a great deal of
pleasure. Then to Westminster, where I met with Mr. Sheply and Mr.
Pinkney at Will's, who took me by water to Billingsgate, at the
Salutation Tavern, whither by-and-by, Mr. Talbot and Adams came, and
bring a great [deal of] good meat, a ham of bacon, &c. Here we staid
and drank till Mr. Adams began to be overcome. Then we parted, and so to
Westminster by water, only seeing Mr. Pinkney at his own house, where he
shewed me how he had alway kept the Lion and Unicorn, in the back of his
chimney, bright, in expectation of the King's coming again. At home
I found Mr. Hunt, who told me how the Parliament had voted that the
Covenant be printed and hung in churches again. Great hopes of the
King's coming again. To bed.

6th. (Shrove Tuesday.) I called Mr. Sheply and we both went up to my
Lord's lodgings at Mr. Crew's, where he bade us to go home again, and
get a fire against an hour after. Which we did at White Hall, whither
he came, and after talking with him and me about his going to sea, he
called me by myself to go along with him into the garden, where he asked
me how things were with me, and what he had endeavoured to do with my
uncle to get him to do something for me but he would say nothing too. He
likewise bade me look out now at this turn some good place, and he would
use all his own, and all the interest of his friends that he had in
England, to do me good. And asked me whether I could, without too much
inconvenience, go to sea as his secretary, and bid me think of it. He
also began to talk of things of State, and told me that he should want
one in that capacity at sea, that he might trust in, and therefore he
would have me to go. He told me also, that he did believe the King would
come in, and did discourse with me about it, and about the affection
of the people and City, at which I was full glad. After he was gone, I
waiting upon him through the garden till he came to the Hall, where I
left him and went up to my office, where Mr. Hawly brought one to me,
a seaman, that had promised Rio to him if he get him a purser's place,
which I think to endeavour to do. Here comes my uncle Tom, whom I
took to Will's and drank with, poor man, he comes to inquire about the
knights of Windsor, of which he desires to get to be one.

     [The body of Poor Knights of Windsor was founded by Edward III.  The
     intention of the king with regard to the poor knights was to provide
     relief and comfortable subsistence for such valiant soldiers as
     happened in their old age to fall into poverty and decay.  On
     September 20th, 1659, a Report having been read respecting the Poor
     Knights of Windsor, the House "ordered that it be referred to a
     Committee, to look into the revenue for maintenance of the Poor
     Knights of Windsor," &c.  (See Tighe and Davis's "Annals of
     Windsor.")]

While we were drinking, in comes Mr. Day, a carpenter in Westminster, to
tell me that it was Shrove Tuesday, and that I must go with him to their
yearly Club upon this day, which I confess I had quite forgot. So I went
to the Bell, where were Mr. Eglin, Veezy, Vincent a butcher, one more,
and Mr. Tanner, with whom I played upon a viall, and he a viallin, after
dinner, and were very merry, with a special good dinner, a leg of veal
and bacon, two capons and sausages and fritters, with abundance of wine.
After that I went home, where I found Kate Sterpin who hath not been
here a great while before. She gone I went to see Mrs. Jem, at whose
chamber door I found a couple of ladies, but she not being there, we
hunted her out, and found that she and another had hid themselves behind
a door. Well, they all went down into the dining-room, where it was full
of tag, rag, and bobtail, dancing, singing, and drinking, of which I was
ashamed, and after I had staid a dance or two I went away. Going home,
called at my Lord's for Mr. Sheply, but found him at the Lion with a
pewterer, that he had bought pewter to-day of. With them I drank, and so
home and wrote by the post, by my Lord's command, for J. Goods to come
up presently. For my Lord intends to go forthwith into the Swiftsure
till the Nazeby be ready. This day I hear that the Lords do intend to
sit, and great store of them are now in town, and I see in the Hall
to-day. Overton at Hull do stand out, but can, it is thought, do
nothing; and Lawson, it is said, is gone with some ships thither, but
all that is nothing. My Lord told me, that there was great endeavours to
bring in the Protector again; but he told me, too, that he did believe
it would not last long if he were brought in; no, nor the King neither
(though he seems to think that he will come in), unless he carry himself
very soberly and well. Every body now drinks the King's health without
any fear, whereas before it was very private that a man dare do it. Monk
this day is feasted at Mercers' Hall, and is invited one after another
to all the twelve Halls in London! Many think that he is honest yet, and
some or more think him to be a fool that would raise himself, but think
that he will undo himself by endeavouring it. My mind, I must needs
remember, has been very much eased and joyed at my Lord's great
expressions of kindness this day, and in discourse thereupon my wife and
I lay awake an hour or two in our bed.

7th. (Ash Wednesday.) In the morning I went to my Lord at Mr. Crew's,
in my way Washington overtook me and told me upon my question whether
he knew of any place now void that I might have, by power over friends,
that this day Mr. G. Montagu was to be made 'Custos Rotulorum' for
Westminster, and that by friends I might get to be named by him Clerk of
the Peace, with which I was, as I am at all new things, very much joyed,
so when I came to Mr. Crew's, I spoke to my Lord about it, who told me
he believed Mr. Montagu had already promised it, and that it was given
him only that he might gratify one person with the place I look for.
Here, among many that were here, I met with Mr. Lynes, the surgeon, who
promised me some seeds of the sensitive plant.

     [Evelyn, about the same date (August 9th, 1661), "tried several
     experiments on the sensitive plant and humilis, which contracted
     with the least touch of the sun through a burning glass, though it
     rises and opens only when it shines on it"]

I spoke too with Mr. Pierce the surgeon, who gave me great encouragement
to go to sea with my Lord. Thence going homewards, my Lord overtook me
in his coach, and called me in, and so I went with him to St. James's,
and G. Montagu being gone to White Hall, we walked over the Park
thither, all the way he discoursing of the times, and of the change
of things since the last year, and wondering how he could bear with so
great disappointment as he did. He did give me the best advice that he
could what was best for me, whether to stay or go with him, and offered
all the ways that could be, how he might do me good, with the greatest
liberty and love that could be. I left him at Whitehall, and myself went
to Westminster to my office, whither nothing to do, but I did discourse
with Mr. Falconbridge about Le Squire's place, and had his consent to
get it if I could. I afterwards in the Hall met with W. Simons, who
put me in the best way how to get it done. Thence by appointment to
the Angel in King Street, where Chetwind, Mr. Thomas and Doling were at
oysters, and beginning Lent this day with a fish dinner. After dinner
Mr. Thomas and I by water to London, where I went to Herring's and
received the L50 of my Lord's upon Frank's bill from Worcester. I gave
in the bill and set my hand to his bill. Thence I went to the Pope's
Head Alley and called on Adam Chard, and bought a catcall there, it cost
me two groats. Thence went and gave him a cup of ale. After that to the
Sun behind the Exchange, where meeting my uncle Wight by the way, took
him with me thither, and after drinking a health or two round at the
Cock (Mr. Thomas being gone thither), we parted, he and I homewards,
parted at Fleet Street, where I found my father newly come home from
Brampton very well. He left my uncle with his leg very dangerous, and do
believe he cannot continue in that condition long. He tells me that my
uncle did acquaint him very largely what he did intend to do with his
estate, to make me his heir and give my brother Tom something, and that
my father and mother should have likewise something, to raise portions
for John and Pall. I pray God he may be as good as his word. Here I
staid and supped and so home, there being Joyce Norton there and Ch.
Glascock. Going home I called at Wotton's and took home a piece of
cheese. At home Mr. Sheply sat with me a little while, and so we all
to bed. This news and my Lord's great kindness makes me very cheerful
within. I pray God make me thankful. This day, according to order, Sir
Arthur [Haselrigge] appeared at the House; what was done I know not, but
there was all the Rumpers almost come to the House to-day. My Lord did
seem to wonder much why Lambert was so willing to be put into the Tower,
and thinks he has some design in it; but I think that he is so poor that
he cannot use his liberty for debts, if he were at liberty; and so it is
as good and better for him to be there, than any where else.

8th. To Whitehall to bespeak some firing for my father at Short's, and
likewise to speak to Mr. Blackburne about Batters being gunner in the
"Wexford." Then to Westminster Hall, where there was a general damp over
men's minds and faces upon some of the Officers of the Army being about
making a remonstrance against Charles Stuart or any single person; but
at noon it was told, that the General had put a stop to it, so all was
well again. Here I met with Jasper, who was to look for me to bring me
to my Lord at the lobby; whither sending a note to my Lord, he comes out
to me and gives me direction to look after getting some money for him
from the Admiralty, seeing that things are so unsafe, that he would not
lay out a farthing for the State, till he had received some money of
theirs. Home about two o'clock, and took my wife by land to Paternoster
Row, to buy some Paragon for a petticoat and so home again. In my way
meeting Mr. Moore, who went home with me while I ate a bit and so back
to Whitehall again, both of us. He waited at the Council for Mr. Crew.
I to the Admiralty, where I got the order for the money, and have taken
care for the getting of it assigned upon Mr. Hutchinson, Treasurer for
the Navy, against tomorrow. Hence going home I met with Mr. King that
belonged to the Treasurers at War and took him to Harper's, who told me
that he and the rest of his fellows are cast out of office by the new
Treasurers. This afternoon, some of the Officers of the Army, and some
of the Parliament, had a conference at White Hall to make all right
again, but I know not what is done. This noon I met at the Dog tavern
Captain Philip Holland, with whom I advised how to make some advantage
of my Lord's going to sea, which he told me might be by having of
five or six servants entered on board, and I to give them what wages I
pleased, and so their pay to be mine; he was also very urgent to have
me take the Secretary's place, that my Lord did proffer me. At the same
time in comes Mr. Wade and Mr. Sterry, secretary to the plenipotentiary
in Denmark, who brought the news of the death of the King of Sweden
at Gottenburgh the 3rd of the last month, and he told me what a great
change he found when he came here, the secluded members being restored.
He also spoke very freely of Mr. Wades profit, which he made while he
was in Zeeland, how he did believe that he cheated Mr. Powell, and that
he made above L500 on the voyage, which Mr. Wade did very angrily deny,
though I believe he was guilty enough.

9th. To my Lord at his lodging, and came to Westminster with him in the
coach, with Mr. Dudley with him, and he in the Painted Chamber

     [The Painted Chamber, or St. Edward's Chamber, in the old Palace at
     Westminster.  The first name was given to it from the curious
     paintings on the walls, and the second from the tradition that
     Edward the Confessor died in it.]

walked a good while; and I telling him that I was willing and ready
to go with him to sea, he agreed that I should, and advised me what
to write to Mr. Downing about it, which I did at my office, that by my
Lord's desire I offered that my place might for a while be supplied by
Mr. Moore, and that I and my security should be bound by the same bond
for him. I went and dined at Mr. Crew's, where Mr. Hawly comes to me,
and I told him the business and shewed him the letter promising him L20
a year, which he liked very well of. I did the same to Mr. Moore, which
he also took for a courtesy. In the afternoon by coach, taking Mr.
Butler with me to the Navy Office, about the L500 for my Lord, which I
am promised to have to-morrow morning. Then by coach back again, and at
White Hall at the Council Chamber spoke with my Lord and got him to sign
the acquittance for the L500, and he also told me that he had spoke to
Mr. Blackburne to put off Mr. Creed and that I should come to him for
direction in the employment. After this Mr. Butler and I to Harper's,
where we sat and drank for two hours till ten at night; the old woman
she was drunk and began to talk foolishly in commendation of her son
James. Home and to bed. All night troubled in my thoughts how to order
my business upon this great change with me that I could not sleep, and
being overheated with drink I made a promise the next morning to drink
no strong drink this week, for I find that it makes me sweat and puts me
quite out of order. This day it was resolved that the writs do go out in
the name of the Keepers of the Liberty, and I hear that it is resolved
privately that a treaty be offered with the King. And that Monk did
check his soldiers highly for what they did yesterday.

10th. In the morning went to my father's, whom I took in his cutting
house,--[His father was a tailor, and this was his cutting-out
room.]--and there I told him my resolution to go to sea with my Lord,
and consulted with him how to dispose of my wife, and we resolved of
letting her be at Mr. Bowyer's. Thence to the Treasurer of the Navy,
where I received L500 for my Lord, and having left L200 of it with
Mr. Rawlinson at his house for Sheply, I went with the rest to the Sun
tavern on Fish Street Hill, where Mr. Hill, Stevens and Mr. Hater of
the Navy Office had invited me, where we had good discourse and a fine
breakfast of Mr. Hater. Then by coach home, where I took occasion to
tell my wife of my going to sea, who was much troubled at it, and was
with some dispute at last willing to continue at Mr. Bowyer's in my
absence. After this to see Mrs. Jem and paid her maid L7, and then to
Mr. Blackburne, who told me what Mr. Creed did say upon the news of my
coming into his place, and that he did propose to my Lord that there
should be two Secretaries, which made me go to Sir H. Wright's where my
Lord dined and spoke with him about it, but he seemed not to agree to
the motion. Hither W. Howe comes to me and so to Westminster. In the way
he told me, what I was to provide and so forth against my going. He went
with me to my office, whither also Mr. Madge comes half foxed and played
the fool upon the violin that made me weary. Then to Whitehall and so
home and set many of my things in order against my going. My wife was
late making of caps for me, and the wench making an end of a pair of
stockings that she was knitting of. So to bed.

11th. (Sunday.) All the day busy without my band on, putting up my books
and things, in order to my going to sea. At night my wife and I went to
my father's to supper, where J. Norton and Chas. Glascocke supt with us,
and after supper home, where the wench had provided all things against
tomorrow to wash, and so to bed, where I much troubled with my cold and
coughing.

12th. This day the wench rose at two in the morning to wash, and my wife
and I lay talking a great while. I by reason of my cold could not tell
how to sleep. My wife and I to the Exchange, where we bought a great
many things, where I left her and went into London, and at Bedells the
bookseller's at the Temple gate I paid L12 10s. 6d. for Mr. Fuller by
his direction. So came back and at Wilkinson's found Mr. Sheply and some
sea people, as the cook of the Nazeby and others, at dinner. Then to the
White Horse in King Street, where I got Mr. Buddle's horse to ride to
Huntsmore to Mr. Bowyer's, where I found him and all well, and willing
to have my wife come and board with them while I was at sea, which was
the business I went about. Here I lay and took a thing for my cold,
namely a spoonful of honey and a nutmeg scraped into it, by Mr. Bowyer's
direction, and so took it into my mouth, which I found did do me much
good.

13th. It rained hard and I got up early, and got to London by 8 o'clock
at my Lord's lodgings, who told me that I was to be secretary, and Creed
to be deputy treasurer to the Fleet, at which I was troubled, but I
could not help it. After that to my father's to look after things, and
so at my shoemaker's and others. At night to Whitehall, where I met with
Simons and Luellin at drink with them at Roberts at Whitehall. Then to
the Admiralty, where I talked with Mr. Creed till the Brothers, and they
were very seemingly willing and glad that I have the place since my Lord
would dispose of it otherwise than to them. Home and to bed. This day
the Parliament voted all that had been done by the former Rump against
the House of Lords be void, and to-night that the writs go out without
any qualification. Things seem very doubtful what will be the end of
all; for the Parliament seems to be strong for the King, while the
soldiers do all talk against.

14th. To my Lord, where infinity of applications to him and to me. To my
great trouble, my Lord gives me all the papers that was given to him, to
put in order and give him an account of them. Here I got half-a-piece of
a person of Mr. Wright's recommending to my Lord to be Preacher of the
Speaker frigate. I went hence to St. James's and Mr. Pierce the surgeon
with me, to speak with Mr. Clerke, Monk's secretary, about getting some
soldiers removed out of Huntingdon to Oundle, which my Lord told me
he did to do a courtesy to the town, that he might have the greater
interest in them, in the choice of the next Parliament; not that he
intends to be chosen himself, but that he might have Mr. G. Montagu
and my Lord Mandeville chose there in spite of the Bernards. This done
(where I saw General Monk and methought he seemed a dull heavy man), he
and I to Whitehall, where with Luellin we dined at Marsh's. Coming home
telling my wife what we had to dinner, she had a mind to some cabbage,
and I sent for some and she had it. Went to the Admiralty, where a
strange thing how I am already courted by the people. This morning among
others that came to me I hired a boy of Jenkins of Westminster and Burr
to be my clerk. This night I went to Mr. Creed's chamber where he gave
me the former book of the proceedings in the fleet and the Seal. Then to
Harper's where old Beard was and I took him by coach to my Lord's, but
he was not at home, but afterwards I found him out at Sir H. Wright's.
Thence by coach, it raining hard, to Mrs. Jem, where I staid a while,
and so home, and late in the night put up my things in a sea-chest that
Mr. Sheply lent me, and so to bed.

15th. Early packing up my things to be sent by cart with the rest of my
Lord's. So to Will's, where I took leave of some of my friends. Here I
met Tom Alcock, one that went to school with me at Huntingdon, but I had
not seen him these sixteen years. So in the Hall paid and made even with
Mrs. Michell; afterwards met with old Beale, and at the Axe paid him
this quarter to Ladyday next. In the afternoon Dick Mathews comes to
dine, and I went and drank with him at Harper's. So into London by
water, and in Fish Street my wife and I bought a bit of salmon for 8d.
and went to the Sun Tavern and ate it, where I did promise to give her
all that I have in the world but my books, in case I should die at sea.
From thence homewards; in the way my wife bought linen for three smocks
and other things. I went to my Lord's and spoke with him. So home with
Mrs. Jem by coach and then home to my own house. From thence to the Fox
in King-street to supper on a brave turkey of Mr. Hawly's, with
some friends of his there, Will Bowyer, &c. After supper I went to
Westminster Hall, and the Parliament sat till ten at night, thinking and
being expected to dissolve themselves to-day, but they did not. Great
talk to-night that the discontented officers did think this night to
make a stir, but prevented. To the Fox again. Home with my wife, and to
bed extraordinary sleepy.

16th. No sooner out of bed but troubled with abundance of clients,
seamen. My landlord Vanly's man came to me by my direction yesterday,
for I was there at his house as I was going to London by water, and I
paid him rent for my house for this quarter ending at Lady day, and took
an acquittance that he wrote me from his master. Then to Mr. Sheply, to
the Rhenish Tavern House, where Mr. Pim, the tailor, was, and gave us a
morning draft and a neat's tongue. Home and with my wife to London, we
dined at my father's, where Joyce Norton and Mr. Armiger dined also.
After dinner my wife took leave of them in order to her going to-morrow
to Huntsmore. In my way home I went to the Chapel in Chancery Lane
to bespeak papers of all sorts and other things belonging to writing
against my voyage. So home, where I spent an hour or two about my
business in my study. Thence to the Admiralty, and staid a while, so
home again, where Will Bowyer came to tell us that he would bear my wife
company in the coach to-morrow. Then to Westminster Hall, where I heard
how the Parliament had this day dissolved themselves, and did pass very
cheerfully through the Hall, and the Speaker without his mace. The whole
Hall was joyful thereat, as well as themselves, and now they begin to
talk loud of the King. To-night I am told, that yesterday, about five
o'clock in the afternoon, one came with a ladder to the Great Exchange,
and wiped with a brush the inscription that was upon King Charles, and
that there was a great bonfire made in the Exchange, and people called
out "God bless. King Charles the Second!"

     ["Then the writing in golden letters, that was engraven under the
     statue of Charles I, in the Royal Exchange ('Exit tyrannus, Regum
     ultimus, anno libertatis Angliae, anno Domini 1648, Januarie xxx.)
     was washed out by a painter, who in the day time raised a ladder,
     and with a pot and brush washed the writing quite out, threw down
     his pot and brush and said it should never do him any more service,
     in regard that it had the honour to put out rebels' hand-writing.
     He then came down, took away his ladder, not a misword said to him,
     and by whose order it was done was not then known.  The merchants
     were glad and joyful, many people were gathered together, and
     against the Exchange made a bonfire. "Rugge's Diurnal."  In the
     Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts at the British Museum is a
     pamphlet which is dated in MS. March 21st, 1659-60, where this act
     is said to be by order of Monk: "The Loyal Subjects Teares for the
     Sufferings and Absence of their Sovereign Charles II., King of
     England, Scotland, and Ireland; with an Observation upon the
     expunging of 'Exit Tyrannus, Regum ultimus', by order of General
     Monk, and some Advice to the Independents, Anabaptists, Phanatiques,
     &c.  London, 1660."]

From the Hall I went home to bed, very sad in mind to part with my wife,
but God's will be done.

17th. This morning bade adieu in bed to the company of my wife. We rose
and I gave my wife some money to serve her for a time, and what papers
of consequence I had. Then I left her to get her ready and went to my
Lord's with my boy Eliezer to my Lord's lodging at Mr. Crew's. Here I
had much business with my Lord, and papers, great store, given me by my
Lord to dispose of as of the rest. After that, with Mr. Moore home to my
house and took my wife by coach to the Chequer in Holborn, where, after
we had drank, &c., she took coach and so farewell. I staid behind with
Tom Alcock and Mr. Anderson, my old chamber fellow at Cambridge his
brother, and drank with them there, who were come to me thither about
one that would have a place at sea. Thence with Mr. Hawly to dinner at
Mr. Crew's. After dinner to my own house, where all things were put up
into the dining-room and locked up, and my wife took the keys along with
her.

This day, in the presence of Mr. Moore (who made it) and Mr. Hawly, I
did before I went out with my wife, seal my will to her, whereby I did
give her all that I have in the world, but my books which I give to my
brother John, excepting only French books, which my wife is to have. In
the evening at the Admiralty, I met my Lord there and got a commission
for Williamson to be captain of the Harp frigate, and afterwards went
by coach taking Mr. Crips with me to my Lord and got him to sign it at
table as he was at supper. And so to Westminster back again with him
with me, who had a great desire to go to sea and my Lord told me that he
would do him any favour. So I went home with him to his mother's house
by me in Axe Yard, where I found Dr. Clodius's wife and sat there
talking and hearing of old Mrs. Crisp playing of her old lessons upon
the harpsichon till it was time to go to bed. After that to bed, and
Laud, her son lay with me in the best chamber in her house, which indeed
was finely furnished.

18th. I rose early and went to the barber's (Jervas) in Palace Yard and
I was trimmed by him, and afterwards drank with him a cup or two of ale,
and did begin to hire his man to go with me to sea. Then to my Lord's
lodging where I found Captain Williamson and gave him his commission
to be Captain of the Harp, and he gave me a piece of gold and 20s. in
silver. So to my own house, where I staid a while and then to dinner
with Mr. Shepley at my Lord's lodgings. After that to Mr. Mossum's,
where he made a very gallant sermon upon "Pray for the life of the King
and the King's son." (Ezra vi. 10.) From thence to Mr. Crew's, but my
Lord not being within I did not stay, but went away and met with Mr.
Woodfine, who took me to an alehouse in Drury Lane, and we sat and drank
together, and ate toasted cakes which were very good, and we had a great
deal of mirth with the mistress of the house about them. From thence
homewards, and called at Mr. Blagrave's, where I took up my note that he
had of mine for 40s., which he two years ago did give me as a pawn while
he had my lute. So that all things are even between him and I. So to
Mrs. Crisp, where she and her daughter and son and I sat talking
till ten o'clock at night, I giving them the best advice that I could
concerning their son, how he should go to sea, and so to bed.

19th. Early to my Lord, where infinity of business to do, which makes
my head full; and indeed, for these two or three days, I have not been
without a great many cares and thoughts concerning them. After that to
the Admiralty, where a good while with Mr. Blackburne, who told me that
it was much to be feared that the King would come in, for all good men
and good things were now discouraged. Thence to Wilkinson's, where
Mr. Sheply and I dined; and while we were at dinner, my Lord Monk's
lifeguard come by with the Serjeant at Arms before them, with two
Proclamations, that all Cavaliers do depart the town; but the other that
all officers that were lately disbanded should do the same. The last of
which Mr. R. Creed, I remember, said, that he looked upon it as if they
had said, that all God's people should depart the town. Thence with some
sea officers to the Swan, where we drank wine till one comes to me to
pay me some money from Worcester, viz., L25. His name is Wilday. I sat
in another room and took my money and drank with him till the rest of my
company were gone and so we parted. Going home the water was high,
and so I got Crockford to carry me over it. So home, and left my money
there. All the discourse now-a-day is, that the King will come again;
and for all I see, it is the wishes of all; and all do believe that it
will be so. My mind is still much troubled for my poor wife, but I hope
that this undertaking will be worth my pains. To Whitehall and staid
about business at the Admiralty late, then to Tony Robins's, where Capt.
Stokes, Mr. Luddington and others were, and I did solicit the Captain
for Laud Crisp, who gave me a promise that he would entertain him. After
that to Mrs. Crisp's where Dr. Clodius and his wife were. He very merry
with drink. We played at cards late and so to bed. This day my Lord
dined at my Lord Mayor's [Allen], and Jasper was made drunk, which my
Lord was very angry at.

20th. This morning I rose early and went to my house to put things in a
little order against my going, which I conceive will be to-morrow (the
weather still very rainy). After that to my Lord, where I found very
great deal of business, he giving me all letters and papers that come
to him about business, for me to give him account of when we come
on shipboard. Hence with Capt. Isham by coach to Whitehall to the
Admiralty. He and I and Chetwind, Doling and Luellin dined together at
Marsh's at Whitehall. So to the Bull Head whither W. Simons comes to us
and I gave them my foy

     [Foy. A feast given by one who is about to leave a place.  In Kent,
     according to Grose, a treat to friends, either at going abroad or
     coming home.  See Diary, November 25th, 1661.]

against my going to sea; and so we took leave one of another, they
promising me to write to me to sea. Hither comes Pim's boy, by my
direction, with two monteeres--[Monteeres, montero (Spanish), a kind of
huntsman's cap.]--for me to take my choice of, and I chose the saddest
colour and left the other for Mr. Sheply. Hence by coach to London, and
took a short melancholy leave of my father and mother, without having
them to drink, or say anything of business one to another. And indeed I
had a fear upon me I should scarce ever see my mother again, she having
a great cold then upon her. Then to Westminster, where by reason of rain
and an easterly wind, the water was so high that there was boats rowed
in King Street and all our yard was drowned, that one could not go to my
house, so as no man has seen the like almost, most houses full of water.

     ["In this month the wind was very high, and caused great tides, so
     that great hurt was done to the inhabitants of Westminster, King
     Street being quite drowned.  The Maidenhead boat was cast away, and
     twelve persons with her.  Also, about Dover the waters brake in upon
     the mainland; and in Kent was very much damage done; so that report
     said, there was L20,000 worth of harm done."--Rugge's Diurnal.--B.]

Then back by coach to my Lord's; where I met Mr. Sheply, who staid with
me waiting for my Lord's coming in till very late. Then he and I, and
William Howe went with our swords to bring my Lord home from Sir H.
Wright's. He resolved to go to-morrow if the wind ceased. Sheply and I
home by coach. I to Mrs. Crisp's, who had sat over a good supper long
looking for me. So we sat talking and laughing till it was very late,
and so Laud and I to bed.

21st. To my Lord's, but the wind very high against us, and the weather
bad we could not go to-day; here I did very much business, and then to
my Lord Widdrington's from my Lord, with his desire that he might have
the disposal of the writs of the Cinque Ports. My Lord was very civil to
me, and called for wine, and writ a long letter in answer. Thence I went
to a tavern over against Mr. Pierce's with judge Advocate Fowler and Mr.
Burr, and sat and drank with them two or three pints of wine. After that
to Mr. Crew's again and gave my Lord an account of what I had done, and
so about my business to take leave of my father and mother, which by
a mistake I have put down yesterday. Thence to Westminster to Crisp's,
where we were very merry; the old woman sent for a supper for me, and
gave me a handkercher with strawberry buttons on it, and so to bed.

22nd. Up very early and set things in order at my house, and so took
leave of Mrs. Crispe and her daughter (who was in bed) and of Mrs. Hunt.
Then to my Lord's lodging at the gate and did so there, where Mr. Hawly
came to me and I gave him the key of my house to keep, and he went with
me to Mr. Crew's, and there I took my last leave of him. But the weather
continuing very bad my Lord would not go to-day. My Lord spent this
morning private in sealing of his last will and testament with Mr. W.
Mountagu. After that I went forth about my own business to buy a pair of
riding grey serge stockings and sword and belt and hose, and after that
took Wotton and Brigden to the Pope's Head Tavern in Chancery Lane,
where Gilb. Holland and Shelston were, and we dined and drank a great
deal of wine, and they paid all. Strange how these people do now promise
me anything; one a rapier, the other a vessel of wine or a gun, and one
offered me his silver hatband to do him a courtesy. I pray God to
keep me from being proud or too much lifted up hereby. After that to
Westminster, and took leave of Kate Sterpin who was very sorry to part
with me, and after that of Mr. George Mountagu, and received my warrant
of Mr. Blackburne, to be Secretary to the two Generals of the Fleet.
Then to take my leave of the Clerks of the Council, and thence Doling
and Luellin would have me go with them to Mount's chamber, where we
sat and talked and then I went away. So to my Lord (in my way meeting
Chetwind and Swan and bade them farewell) where I lay all night with Mr.
Andrews. This day Mr. Sheply went away on board and I sent my boy with
him. This day also Mrs. Jemimah went to Marrowbone, so I could not see
her. Mr. Moore being out of town to-night I could not take leave of him
nor speak to him about business which troubled me much. I left my small
case therefore with Mr. Andrews for him.

23rd. Up early, carried my Lord's will in a black box to Mr. William
Montagu for him to keep for him. Then to the barber's and put on my
cravat there. So to my Lord again, who was almost ready to be gone and
had staid for me. Hither came Gilb. Holland, and brought me a stick
rapier and Shelston a sugar-loaf, and had brought his wife who he said
was a very pretty woman to the Ship tavern hard by for me to see but
I could not go. Young Reeve also brought me a little perspective glass
which I bought for my Lord, it cost me 8s. So after that my Lord in Sir
H. Wright's coach with Captain Isham, Mr. Thomas, John Crew, W. Howe,
and I in a Hackney to the Tower, where the barges staid for us; my Lord
and the Captain in one, and W. Howe and I, &c., in the other, to the
Long Reach, where the Swiftsure lay at anchor; (in our way we saw the
great breach which the late high water had made, to the loss of many
L1000 to the people about Limehouse.) Soon as my Lord on board, the
guns went off bravely from the ships. And a little while after comes the
Vice-Admiral Lawson, and seemed very respectful to my Lord, and so did
the rest of the Commanders of the frigates that were thereabouts. I to
the cabin allotted for me, which was the best that any had that belonged
to my Lord. I got out some things out of my chest for writing and to
work presently, Mr. Burr and I both. I supped at the deck table with Mr.
Sheply. We were late writing of orders for the getting of ships ready,
&c.; and also making of others to all the seaports between Hastings and
Yarmouth, to stop all dangerous persons that are going or coming between
Flanders and there. After that to bed in my cabin, which was but short;
however I made shift with it and slept very well, and the weather being
good I was not sick at all yet, I know not what I shall be.

24th. At work hard all the day writing letters to the Council, &c. This
day Mr. Creed came on: board and dined very boldly with my Lord, but
he could not get a bed there. At night Capt. Isham who had been at
Gravesend all last night and to-day came and brought Mr. Lucy (one
acquainted with Mrs. Pierce, with whom I had been at her house), I drank
with him in the Captain's cabin, but my business could not stay with
him. I despatch many letters to-day abroad and it was late before we
could get to bed. Mr. Sheply and Howe supped with me in my cabin. The
boy Eliezer flung down a can of beer upon my papers which made me give
him a box of the ear, it having all spoiled my papers and cost me a
great deal of work. So to bed.

25th. (Lord's day). About two o'clock in the morning, letters came from
London by our coxon, so they waked me, but I would not rise but bid him
stay till morning, which he did, and then I rose and carried them in
to my Lord, who read them a-bed. Among the rest, there was the writ
and mandate for him to dispose to the Cinque Ports for choice of
Parliament-men. There was also one for me from Mr. Blackburne, who with
his own hand superscribes it to S.P. Esq., of which God knows I was
not a little proud. After that I wrote a letter to the Clerk of Dover
Castle, to come to my Lord about issuing of those writs. About ten
o'clock Mr. Ibbott, at the end of the long table, begun to pray
and preach and indeed made a very good sermon, upon the duty of all
Christians to be stedfast in faith. After that Captain Cuttance and
I had oysters, my Lord being in his cabin not intending to stir out
to-day. After that up into the great cabin above to dinner with the
Captain, where was Captain Isham and all the officers of the ship. I
took place of all but the Captains; after dinner I wrote a great many
letters to my friends at London. After that, sermon again, at which I
slept, God forgive me! After that, it being a fair day, I walked with
the Captain upon the deck talking. At night I supped with him and after
that had orders from my Lord about some business to be done against
to-morrow, which I sat up late and did and then to bed.

26th. This day it is two years since it pleased God that I was cut of
the stone at Mrs. Turner's in Salisbury Court. And did resolve while I
live to keep it a festival, as I did the last year at my house, and for
ever to have Mrs. Turner and her company with me. But now it pleases God
that I am where I am and so prevented to do it openly; only within my
soul I can and do rejoice, and bless God, being at this time blessed be
his holy name, in as good health as ever I was in my life. This morning
I rose early, and went about making of an establishment of the whole
Fleet, and a list of all the ships, with the number of men and guns:
About an hour after that, we had a meeting of the principal commanders
and seamen, to proportion out the number of these things. After that
to dinner, there being very many commanders on board. All the afternoon
very many orders were made, till I was very weary. At night Mr. Sheply
and W. Howe came and brought some bottles of wine and some things to eat
in my cabin, where we were very merry, remembering the day of being
cut for the stone. Captain Cuttance came afterwards and sat drinking a
bottle of wine till eleven, a kindness he do not usually do the greatest
officer in the ship. After that to bed.

27th. Early in the morning at making a fair new establishment of the
Fleet to send to the Council. This morning, the wind came about, and we
fell into the Hope,--[A reach of the Thames near Tilbury.]--and in our
passing by the Vice-Admiral, he and the rest of the frigates, with him,
did give us abundance of guns and we them, so much that the report of
them broke all the windows in my cabin and broke off the iron bar that
was upon it to keep anybody from creeping in at the Scuttle.--["A small
hole or port cut either in the deck or side of a ship, generally for
ventilation. That in the deck is a small hatch-way."--Smyth's Sailor's
Word-Book.]--This noon I sat the first time with my Lord at table since
my coming to sea. All the afternoon exceeding busy in writing of letters
and orders. In the afternoon, Sir Harry Wright came onboard us, about
his business of being chosen Parliament-man. My Lord brought him to see
my cabin, when I was hard a-writing. At night supped with my Lord too,
with the Captain, and after that to work again till it be very late. So
to bed.

28th. This morning and the whole day busy, and that the more because Mr.
Burr was about his own business all the day at Gravesend. At night there
was a gentleman very well bred, his name was Banes, going for Flushing,
who spoke French and Latin very well, brought by direction from Captain
Clerke hither, as a prisoner, because he called out of the vessel that
he went in, "Where is your King, we have done our business, Vive le
Roi." He confessed himself a Cavalier in his heart, and that he and his
whole family had fought for the King; but that he was then drunk, having
been all night taking his leave at Gravesend the night before, and
so could not remember what it was that he said; but in his words and
carriage showed much of a gentleman. My Lord had a great kindness for
him, but did not think it safe to release him, but commanded him to
be used civilly, so he was taken to the Master's Cabin and had supper
there. In the meantime I wrote a letter to the Council about him, and an
order for the vessel to be sent for back that he was taken out of. But
a while after, he sent a letter down to my Lord, which my Lord did like
very well, and did advise with me what was best to be done. So I put in
something to my Lord and then to the Captain that the gentleman was to
be released and the letter stopped, which was done. So I went up and sat
and talked with him in Latin and French, and drank a bottle or two with
him; and about eleven at night he took boat again, and so God bless him.
Thence I to my cabin and to bed. This day we had news of the election at
Huntingdon for Bernard and Pedly, at which my Lord was much troubled for
his friends' missing of it.

29th. We lie still a little below Gravesend. At night Mr. Sheply
returned from London, and told us of several elections for the next
Parliament. That the King's effigies was new making to be set up in
the Exchange again. This evening was a great whispering of some of the
Vice-Admiral's captains that they were dissatisfied, and did intend to
fight themselves, to oppose the General. But it was soon hushed, and the
Vice-Admiral did wholly deny any such thing, and protested to stand by
the General. At night Mr. Sheply, W. Howe, and I supped in my cabin. So
up to the Master's cabin, where we sat talking, and then to bed.

30th. I was saluted in the morning with two letters, from some that I
had done a favour to, which brought me in each a piece of gold. This
day, while my Lord and we were at dinner, the Nazeby came in sight
towards us, and at last came to anchor close by us. After dinner my Lord
and many others went on board her, where every thing was out of order,
and a new chimney made for my Lord in his bedchamber, which he was much
pleased with. My Lord, in his discourse, discovered a great deal of love
to this ship.

31st. This morning Captain Jowles of the "Wexford" came on board, for
whom I got commission from my Lord to be commander of the ship. Upon the
doing thereof he was to make the 20s. piece that he sent me yesterday,
up L5; wherefore he sent me a bill that he did owe me L4., which I sent
my boy to Gravesend with him, and he did give the boy L4 for me, and the
boy gave him the bill under his hand. This morning, Mr. Hill that lives
in Axe-yard was here on board with the Vice-Admiral. I did give him a
bottle of wine, and was exceedingly satisfied of the power that I have
to make my friends welcome. Many orders to make all the afternoon. At
night Mr. Sheply, Howe, Ibbott, and I supped in my cabin together.




APRIL 1660

April 1st (Lord's day). Mr. Ibbott preached very well. After dinner my
Lord did give me a private list of all the ships that were to be set out
this summer, wherein I do discern that he bath made it his care to put
by as much of the Anabaptists as he can. By reason of my Lord and my
being busy to send away the packet by Mr. Cooke of the Nazeby, it was
four o'clock before we could begin sermon again. This day Captain Guy
come on board from Dunkirk, who tells me that the King will come in, and
that the soldiers at Dunkirk do drink the King's health in the streets.
At night the Captain, Sir R. Stayner, Mr. Sheply, and I did sup together
in the Captain's cabin. I made a commission for Captain Wilgness, of
the Bear, to-night, which got me 30s. So after writing a while I went to
bed.

2d. Up very early, and to get all my things and my boy's packed up.
Great concourse of commanders here this morning to take leave of my Lord
upon his going into the Nazeby, so that the table was full, so there
dined below many commanders, and Mr. Creed, who was much troubled to
hear that he could not go along with my Lord, for he had already got all
his things thither, thinking to stay there, but W. Howe was very high
against it, and he indeed did put him out, though everybody was glad of
it. After dinner I went in one of the boats with my boy before my Lord,
and made shift before night to get my cabin in pretty good order. It
is but little, but very convenient, having one window to the sea
and another to the deck, and a good bed. This morning comes Mr. Ed.
Pickering, like a coxcomb as he always was. He tells me that the King
will come in, but that Monk did resolve to have the doing of it himself,
or else to hinder it.

3d. Late to bed. About three in the morning there was great knocking at
my cabin, which with much difficulty (so they say) waked me, and I
rose, but it was only for a packet, so went to my bed again, and in the
morning gave it my Lord. This morning Capt. Isham comes on board to see
my Lord and drunk his wine before he went into the Downs, there likewise
come many merchants to get convoy to the Baltique, which a course was
taken for. They dined with my Lord, and one of them by name Alderman
Wood talked much to my Lord of the hopes that we have now to be settled,
(under the King he meant); but my Lord took no notice of it. After
dinner which was late my Lord went on shore, and after him I and Capt.
Sparling went in his boat, but the water being almost at low water we
could not stay for fear of not getting into our boat again. So back
again. This day come the Lieutenant of the Swiftsure, who was sent by
my Lord to Hastings, one of the Cinque Ports, to have got Mr. Edward
Montagu to have been one of their burgesses, but could not, for they
were all promised before. After he had done his message, I took him and
Mr. Pierce, the surgeon (who this day came on board, and not before), to
my cabin, where we drank a bottle of wine. At night, busy a-writing, and
so to bed. My heart exceeding heavy for not hearing of my dear wife, and
indeed I do not remember that ever my heart was so apprehensive of her
absence as at this very time.

4th. This morning I dispatch many letters of my own private business to
London. There come Colonel Thomson with the wooden leg, and General Pen,

     [This is the first mention in the Diary of Admiral (afterwards Sir
     William) Penn, with whom Pepys was subsequently so particularly
     intimate.  At this time admirals were sometimes styled generals.
     William Penn was born at Bristol in 1621, of the ancient family of
     the Penns of Penn Lodge, Wilts.  He was Captain at the age of
     twenty-one; Rear-Admiral of Ireland at twenty-three; Vice-Admiral of
     England and General in the first Dutch war, at thirty-two.  He was
     subsequently M.P. for Weymouth, Governor of Kingsale, and Vice-
     Admiral of Munster.  He was a highly successful commander, and in
     1654 he obtained possession of Jamaica.  He was appointed a
     Commissioner of the Navy in 1660, in which year he was knighted.
     After the Dutch fight in 1665, where he distinguished himself as
     second in command under the Duke of York, he took leave of the sea,
     but continued to act as a Commissioner for the Navy till 1669, when
     he retired to Wanstead, on account of his bodily infirmities, and
     dying there, September 16th, 1670, aged forty-nine, was buried in
     the church of St. Mary Redcliffe, in Bristol, where a monument to
     his memory was erected.]

and dined with my Lord and Mr. Blackburne, who told me that it was
certain now that the King must of necessity come in, and that one of the
Council told him there is something doing in order to a treaty already
among them. And it was strange to hear how Mr. Blackburne did already
begin to commend him for a sober man, and how quiet he would be under
his government, &c. I dined all alone to prevent company, which was
exceeding great to-day, in my cabin. After these two were gone Sir W.
Wheeler and Sir John Petters came on board and staid about two or three
hours, and so went away. The Commissioners came to-day, only to consult
about a further reducement of the Fleet, and to pay them as fast as they
can. I did give Davis, their servant, L5 10s. to give to Mr. Moore from
me, in part of the L7 that I borrowed of him, and he is to discount the
rest out of the 36s. that he do owe me. At night, my Lord resolved to
send the Captain of our ship to Waymouth and promote his being chosen
there, which he did put himself into a readiness to do the next morning.

5th. Infinity of business all the morning of orders to make, that I
was very much perplexed that Mr. Burr had failed me of coming back last
night, and we ready to set sail, which we did about noon, and came in
the evening to Lee roads and anchored. At night Mr. Sheply overtook us
who had been at Gray's Market this morning. I spent all the afternoon
upon the deck, it being very pleasant weather. This afternoon Sir Rich.
Stayner and Mr. Creed, after we were come to anchor, did come on board,
and Creed brought me L30, which my Lord had ordered him to pay me upon
account, and Captain Clerke brought me a noted caudle. At night very
sleepy to bed.

6th. This morning came my brother-in-law Balty to see me, and to desire
to be here with me as Reformado,--["a broken or disbanded officer."]
which did much trouble me. But after dinner (my Lord using him very
civilly, at table) I spoke to my Lord, and he presented me a letter to
Captain Stokes for him that he should be there. All the day with
him walking and talking, we under sail as far as the Spitts. In the
afternoon, W. Howe and I to our viallins, the first time since we came
on board. This afternoon I made even with my Lord to this day, and did
give him all the money remaining in my hands. In the evening, it being
fine moonshine, I staid late walking upon the quarter-deck with Mr.
Cuttance, learning of some sea terms; and so down to supper and to bed,
having an hour before put Balty into Burr's cabin, he being out of the
ship.

7th. This day, about nine o'clock in the morning, the wind grew high,
and we being among the sands lay at anchor; I began to be dizzy and
squeamish. Before dinner my Lord sent for me down to eat some oysters,
the best my Lord said that ever he ate in his life, though I have ate as
good at Bardsey. After dinner, and all the afternoon I walked upon the
deck to keep myself from being sick, and at last about five o'clock,
went to bed and got a caudle made me, and sleep upon it very well. This
day Mr. Sheply went to Sheppy.

8th (Lord's day). Very calm again, and I pretty well, but my head aked
all day. About noon set sail; in our way I see many vessels and masts,
which are now the greatest guides for ships. We had a brave wind all the
afternoon, and overtook two good merchantmen that overtook us yesterday,
going to the East Indies. The lieutenant and I lay out of his window
with his glass, looking at the women that were on board them, being
pretty handsome. This evening Major Willoughby, who had been here three
or four days on board with Mr. Pickering, went on board a catch [ketch]
for Dunkirk. We continued sailing when I went to bed, being somewhat
ill again, and Will Howe, the surgeon, parson, and Balty supped in the
Lieutenant's cabin and afterwards sat disputing, the parson for and I
against extemporary prayers, very hot.

9th. We having sailed all night, were come in sight of the Nore and
South Forelands in the morning, and so sailed all day. In the afternoon
we had a very fresh gale, which I brooked better than I thought I should
be able to do. This afternoon I first saw France and Calais, with which
I was much pleased, though it was at a distance. About five o'clock we
came to the Goodwin, so to the Castles about Deal; where our Fleet lay,
among whom we anchored. Great was the shout of guns from the castles
and ships, and our answers, that I never heard yet so great rattling of
guns. Nor could we see one another on board for the smoke that was among
us, nor one ship from another. Soon as we came to anchor, the captains
came from on board their ships all to us on board. This afternoon I
wrote letters for my Lord to the Council, &c., which Mr. Dickering was
to carry, who took his leave this night of my Lord, and Balty after I
had wrote two or three letters by him to my wife and Mr. Bowyer, and had
drank a bottle of wine with him in my cabin which J. Goods and W. Howe
brought on purpose, he took leave of me too to go away to-morrow morning
with Mr. Dickering. I lent Balty 15s. which he was to pay to my wife. It
was one in the morning before we parted. This evening Mr. Sheply came
on board, having escaped a very great danger upon a sand coming from
Chatham.

10th. This morning many or most of the commanders in the Fleet came on
board and dined here, so that some of them and I dined together in the
Round-house, where we were very merry. Hither came the Vice-Admiral to
us, and sat and talked and seemed a very good-natured man. At night as I
was all alone in my cabin, in a melancholy fit playing on my viallin, my
Lord and Sir R. Stayner came into the coach

     ["A sort of chamber or apartment in a large ship of war, just before
     the great cabin.  The floor of it is formed by the aftmost part of
     the quarter deck, and the roof of it by the poop: it is generally
     the habitation of the flag-captain."--Smyth's Sailor's Word-Book.]

and supped there, and called me out to supper with them. After that up
to the Lieutenant's cabin, where he and I and Sir Richard sat till 11
o'clock talking, and so to bed. This day my Lord Goring returned from
France, and landed at Dover.

11th. A Gentleman came this morning from my Lord of Manchester to
my Lord for a pass for Mr. Boyle,' which was made him. I ate a good
breakfast by my Lord's orders with him in the great cabin below. The
wind all this day was very high, so that a gentleman that was at dinner
with my Lord that came along with Sir John Bloys (who seemed a fine man)
was forced to rise from table. This afternoon came a great packet of
letters from London directed to me, among the rest two from my wife,
the first that I have since coming away from London. All the news from
London is that things go on further towards a King. That the Skinners'
Company the other day at their entertaining of General Monk had took
down the Parliament Arms in their Hall, and set up the King's. In the
evening my Lord and I had a great deal of discourse about the several
Captains of the Fleet and his interest among them, and had his mind
clear to bring in the King. He confessed to me that he was not sure of
his own Captain [Cuttance] to be true to him, and that he did not like
Captain Stokes. At night W. Howe and I at our viallins in my cabin,
where Mr. Ibbott and the lieutenant were late. I staid the lieutenant
late, shewing him my manner of keeping a journal. After that to bed. It
comes now into my mind to observe that I am sensible that I have been a
little too free to make mirth with the minister of our ship, he being a
very sober and an upright man.

12th. This day, the weather being very bad, we had no strangers on
board. In the afternoon came the Vice-Admiral on board, with whom my
Lord consulted, and I sent a packet to London at night with several
letters to my friends, as to my wife about my getting of money for
her when she should need it, to Mr. Bowyer that he tell me when the
Messieurs of the offices be paid, to Mr. Moore about the business of my
office, and making even with him as to matter of money. At night after I
had despatched my letters, to bed.

13th. This day very foul all day for rain and wind. In the afternoon set
my own things in my cabin and chests in better order than hitherto, and
set my papers in order. At night sent another packet to London by the
post, and after that was done I went up to the lieutenant's cabin and
there we broached a vessel of ale that we had sent for among us from
Deal to-day. There was the minister and doctor with us. After that
till one o'clock in the morning writing letters to Mr. Downing about my
business of continuing my office to myself, only Mr. Moore to execute it
for me. I had also a very serious and effectual letter from my Lord
to him to that purpose. After that done then to bed, and it being very
rainy, and the rain coming upon my bed, I went and lay with John Goods
in the great cabin below, the wind being so high that we were faro to
lower some of the masts. I to bed, and what with the goodness of the bed
and the rocking of the ship I slept till almost ten o'clock, and then--

14th. Rose and drank a good morning draught there with Mr. Sheply,
which occasioned my thinking upon the happy life that I live now, had I
nothing to care for but myself. The sea was this morning very high,
and looking out of the window I saw our boat come with Mr. Pierce, the
surgeon, in it in great danger, who endeavouring to come on board us,
had like to have been drowned had it not been for a rope. This day I was
informed that my Lord Lambert is got out of the Towers and that there is
L100 proffered to whoever shall bring him forth to the Council of State.

     [The manner of the escape of John Lambert, out of the Tower, on the
     11th inst., as related by Rugge:--"That about eight of the clock at
     night he escaped by a rope tied fast to his window, by which he slid
     down, and in each hand he had a handkerchief; and six men were ready
     to receive him, who had a barge to hasten him away.  She who made
     the bed, being privy to his escape, that night, to blind the warder
     when he came to lock the chamber-door, went to bed, and possessed
     Colonel Lambert's place, and put on his night-cap.  So, when the
     said warder came to lock the door, according to his usual manner, he
     found the curtains drawn, and conceiving it to be Colonel John
     Lambert, he said, 'Good night, my Lord.'  To which a seeming voice
     replied, and prevented all further jealousies.  The next morning, on
     coming to unlock the door, and espying her face, he cried out, 'In
     the name of God, Joan, what makes you here?  Where is my Lord
     Lambert?'  She said, 'He is gone; but I cannot tell whither.'
     Whereupon he caused her to rise, and carried her before the officer
     in the Tower, and [she] was committed to custody.  Some said that a
     lady knit for him a garter of silk, by which he was conveyed down,
     and that she received L100 for her pains."--B]

My Lord is chosen at Waymouth this morning; my Lord had his freedom
brought him by Captain Tiddiman of the port of Dover, by which he is
capable of being elected for them. This day I heard that the Army had in
general declared to stand by what the next Parliament shall do. At night
supped with my Lord.

15th (Lord's day). Up early and was trimmed by the barber in the great
cabin below. After that to put my clothes on and then to sermon, and
then to dinner, where my Lord told us that the University of Cambridge
had a mind to choose him for their burgess, which he pleased himself
with, to think that they do look upon him as a thriving man, and said
so openly at table. At dinner-time Mr. Cook came back from London with a
packet which caused my Lord to be full of thoughts all day, and at night
he bid me privately to get two commissions ready, one for Capt. Robert
Blake to be captain of the Worcester, in the room of Capt. Dekings, an
anabaptist, and one that had witnessed a great deal of discontent with
the present proceedings. The other for Capt. Coppin to come out of that
into the Newbury in the room of Blake, whereby I perceive that General
Monk do resolve to make a thorough change, to make way for the King.
From London I hear that since Lambert got out of the Tower, the
Fanatiques had held up their heads high, but I hope all that will come
to nothing. Late a writing of letters to London to get ready for Mr.
Cook. Then to bed.

16th. And about 4 o'clock in the morning Mr. Cook waked me where I lay
in the great cabin below, and I did give him his packet and directions
for London. So to sleep again. All the morning giving out orders and
tickets to the Commanders of the Fleet to discharge all supernumeraries
that they had above the number that the Council had set in their last
establishment. After dinner busy all the afternoon writing, and so till
night, then to bed.

17th. All the morning getting ready commissions for the Vice-Admiral and
the Rear-Admiral, wherein my Lord was very careful to express the
utmost of his own power, commanding them to obey what orders they should
receive from the Parliament, &c., or both or either of the Generals.

     [Sir Edward Montagu afterwards recommended the Duke of York as High
     Admiral, to give regular and lawful commissions to the Commanders of
     the Fleet, instead of those which they had received from Sir Edward
     himself, or from the Rump Parliament.--Kennett's Register, p. 163.]

The Vice-Admiral dined with us, and in the afternoon my Lord called
me to give him the commission for him, which I did, and he gave it him
himself. A very pleasant afternoon, and I upon the deck all the day, it
was so clear that my Lord's glass shewed us Calais very plain, and the
cliffs were as plain to be seen as Kent, and my Lord at first made me
believe that it was Kent. At night, after supper, my Lord called for
the Rear-Admiral's commission, which I brought him, and I sitting in
my study heard my Lord discourse with him concerning D. King's and
Newberry's being put out of commission. And by the way I did observe
that my Lord did speak more openly his mind to me afterwards at night
than I can find that he did to the Rear-Admiral, though his great
confidant. For I was with him an hour together, when he told me clearly
his thoughts that the King would carry it, and that he did think himself
very happy that he was now at sea, as well for his own sake, as that he
thought he might do his country some service in keeping things quiet.
To bed, and shifting myself from top to toe, there being J. Goods and W.
Howe sat late by my bedside talking. So to sleep, every day bringing me
a fresh sense of the pleasure of my present life.

18th. This morning very early came Mr. Edward Montagu on board, but what
was the business of his coming again or before without any servant
and making no stay at all I cannot guess. This day Sir R. Stayner, Mr.
Sheply, and as many of my Lord's people as could be spared went to Dover
to get things ready against to-morrow for the election there. I all
the afternoon dictating in my cabin (my own head being troubled with
multiplicity of business) to Burr, who wrote for me above a dozen
letters, by which I have made my mind more light and clear than I have
had it yet since I came on board. At night sent a packet to London, and
Mr. Cook returned hence bringing me this news, that the Sectaries do
talk high what they will do, but I believe all to no purpose, but the
Cavaliers are something unwise to talk so high on the other side as they
do. That the Lords do meet every day at my Lord of Manchester's, and
resolve to sit the first day of the Parliament. That it is evident now
that the General and the Council do resolve to make way for the King's
coming. And it is now clear that either the Fanatiques must now be
undone, or the gentry and citizens throughout England, and clergy must
fall, in spite of their militia and army, which is not at all possible
I think. At night I supped with W. Howe and Mr. Luellin (being the first
time that I had been so long with him) in the great cabin below. After
that to bed, and W. Howe sat by my bedside, and he and I sang a psalm or
two and so I to sleep.

19th. A great deal of business all this day, and Burr being gone to
shore without my leave did vex me much. At dinner news was brought us
that my Lord was chosen at Dover. This afternoon came one Mr. Mansell on
board as a Reformado, to whom my Lord did shew exceeding great respect,
but upon what account I do not yet know. This day it has rained much, so
that when I came to go to bed I found it wet through, so I was fain to
wrap myself up in a dry sheet, and so lay all night.

20th. All the morning I was busy to get my window altered, and to
have my table set as I would have it, which after it was done I was
infinitely pleased with it, and also to see what a command I have to
have every one ready to come and go at my command. This evening came Mr.
Boyle on board, for whom I writ an order for a ship to transport him
to Flushing. He supped with my Lord, my Lord using him as a person
of honour. This evening too came Mr. John Pickering on board us.
This evening my head ached exceedingly, which I impute to my sitting
backwards in my cabin, otherwise than I am used to do. To-night Mr.
Sheply told me that he heard for certain at Dover that Mr. Edw. Montagu
did go beyond sea when he was here first the other day, and I am apt to
believe that he went to speak with the King. This day one told me how
that at the election at Cambridge for knights of the shire, Wendby and
Thornton by declaring to stand for the Parliament and a King and the
settlement of the Church, did carry it against all expectation against
Sir Dudley North and Sir Thomas Willis! I supped to-night with Mr.
Sheply below at the half-deck table, and after that I saw Mr. Pickering
whom my Lord brought down to his cabin, and so to bed.

21st. This day dined Sir John Boys

     [Of Bonnington and Sandwich, Gentleman of the Privy-Chamber to
     Charles I.  He defended Donnington Castle, Berkshire, for the King
     against Jeremiah Horton, 1644, and received an augmentation to his
     arms in consequence.]

and some other gentlemen formerly great Cavaliers, and among the rest
one Mr. Norwood, for whom my Lord give a convoy to carry him to the
Brill,--[Brielle, or Den Briel, a seaport town in the province of South
Holland.]--but he is certainly going to the King. For my Lord commanded
me that I should not enter his name in my book. My Lord do show them and
that sort of people great civility. All their discourse and others are
of the King's coming, and we begin to speak of it very freely. And heard
how in many churches in London, and upon many signs there, and upon
merchants' ships in the river, they had set up the King's arms. In the
afternoon the Captain would by all means have me up to his cabin, and
there treated me huge nobly, giving me a barrel of pickled oysters,
and opened another for me, and a bottle of wine, which was a very great
favour. At night late singing with W. Howe, and under the barber's hands
in the coach. This night there came one with a letter from Mr. Edw.
Montagu to my Lord, with command to deliver it to his own hands. I do
believe that he do carry some close business on for the King.

     [Pepys's guess at E. Montagu's business is confirmed by Clarendon's
     account of his employment of him to negotiate with Lord Sandwich on
     behalf of the King.  ("History of the Rebellion," book xvi.)--Notes
     and Queries, vol. x.  p. 3--M. B.]

This day I had a large letter from Mr. Moore, giving me an account of
the present dispute at London that is like to be at the beginning of
the Parliament, about the House of Lords, who do resolve to sit with the
Commons, as not thinking themselves dissolved yet. Which, whether it
be granted or no, or whether they will sit or no, it will bring a great
many inconveniences. His letter I keep, it being a very well writ one.

22d (Easter Sunday). Several Londoners, strangers, friends of the
Captains, dined here, who, among other things told us, how the King's
Arms are every day set up in houses and churches, particularly in
Allhallows Church in Thames-street, John Simpson's church, which being
privately done was, a great eye-sore to his people when they came to
church and saw it. Also they told us for certain, that the King's statue
is making by the Mercers' Company (who are bound to do it) to set up in
the Exchange. After sermon in the afternoon I fell to writing letters
against to-morrow to send to London. After supper to bed.

23rd. All the morning very busy getting my packet ready for London, only
for an hour or two had the Captain and Mr. Sheply in my cabin at the
barrel of pickled oysters that the Captain did give me on Saturday last.
After dinner I sent Mr. Dunn to London with the packet. This afternoon
I had 40s. given me by Captain Cowes of the Paradox.' In the evening the
first time that we had any sport among the seamen, and indeed there was
extraordinary good sport after my Lord had done playing at ninepins.
After that W. Howe and I went to play two trebles in the great
cabin below, which my Lord hearing, after supper he called for our
instruments, and played a set of Lock's, two trebles, and a base, and
that being done, he fell to singing of a song made upon the Rump, with
which he played himself well, to the tune of "The Blacksmith." After all
that done, then to bed.

     ["The Blacksmith" was the same tune as "Green Sleeves."  The
     earliest known copy of "The Praise of the Blacksmith" is in "An
     Antidote against Melancholy," 1661.  See "Roxburghe Ballads," ed.
     W. Chappell, 1872, vol. ii.  p. 126.  (Ballad Society:)]

24th. This morning I had Mr. Luellin and Mr. Sheply to the remainder
of my oysters that were left yesterday. After that very busy all
the morning. While I was at dinner with my Lord, the Coxon of the
Vice-Admiral came for me to the Vice-Admiral to dinner. So I told my
Lord and he gave me leave to go. I rose therefore from table and went,
where there was very many commanders, and very pleasant we were on board
the London, which hath a state-room much bigger than the Nazeby, but not
so rich. After that, with the Captain on board our own ship, where we
were saluted with the news of Lambert's being taken, which news was
brought to London on Sunday last. He was taken in Northamptonshire by
Colonel Ingoldsby, at the head of a party, by which means their whole
design is broke, and things now very open and safe. And every man begins
to be merry and full of hopes. In the afternoon my Lord gave a great
large character to write out, so I spent all the day about it, and after
supper my Lord and we had some more very good musique and singing of
"Turne Amaryllis," as it is printed in the song book, with which my Lord
was very much pleased. After that to bed.

25th. All the morning about my Lord's character. Dined to-day with
Captain Clerke on board the Speaker (a very brave ship) where was the
Vice-Admiral, Rear-Admiral, and many other commanders. After dinner
home, not a little contented to see how I am treated, and with what
respect made a fellow to the best commanders in the Fleet. All the
afternoon finishing of the character, which I did and gave it my Lord,
it being very handsomely done and a very good one in itself, but that
not truly Alphabetical. Supped with Mr. Sheply, W. Howe, &c. in Mr.
Pierce, the Purser's cabin, where very merry, and so to bed. Captain
Isham came hither to-day.

26th. This day came Mr. Donne back from London, who brought letters with
him that signify the meeting of the Parliament yesterday. And in the
afternoon by other letters I hear, that about twelve of the Lords met
and had chosen my Lord of Manchester' Speaker of the House of Lords (the
young Lords that never sat yet, do forbear to sit for the present); and
Sir Harbottle Grimstone, Speaker for the House of Commons. The House of
Lords sent to have a conference with the House of Commons, which, after
a little debate, was granted. Dr. Reynolds' preached before the Commons
before they sat. My Lord told me how Sir H. Yelverton (formerly my
school-fellow) was chosen in the first place for Northamptonshire
and Mr. Crew in the second. And told me how he did believe that the
Cavaliers have now the upper hand clear of the Presbyterians. All the
afternoon I was writing of letters, among the rest one to W. Simons,
Peter Luellin and Tom Doling, which because it is somewhat merry I keep
a copy of. After that done Mr. Sheply, W. Howe and I down with J. Goods
into my Lord's storeroom of wine and other drink, where it was very
pleasant to observe the massy timbers that the ship is made of. We in
the room were wholly under water and yet a deck below that. After that
to supper, where Tom Guy supped with us, and we had very good laughing,
and after that some musique, where Mr. Pickering beginning to play a
bass part upon the viall did it so like a fool that I was ashamed of
him. After that to bed.

27th. This morning Burr was absent again from on board, which I was
troubled at, and spoke to Mr. Pierce, Purser, to speak to him of it, and
it is my mind. This morning Pim [the tailor] spent in my cabin, putting
a great many ribbons to a suit. After dinner in the afternoon came on
board Sir Thomas Hatton and Sir R. Maleverer going for Flushing; but all
the world know that they go where the rest of the many gentlemen go that
every day flock to the King at Breda.

     [The King arrived at Breda on the 14th April.  Sir W. Lower writes
     ("Voiage and Residence of Charles II. in Holland," p. 5): "Many
     considerations obliged him to depart the territories under the
     obedience of the King of Spain in this conjuncture of affairs."]

They supped here, and my Lord treated them as he do the rest that go
thither, with a great deal of civility. While we were at supper a packet
came, wherein much news from several friends. The chief is that, that I
had from Mr. Moore, viz. that he fears the Cavaliers in the House will
be so high, that the others will be forced to leave the House and fall
in with General Monk, and so offer things to the King so high on the
Presbyterian account that he may refuse, and so they will endeavour some
more mischief; but when I told my Lord it, he shook his head and told
me, that the Presbyterians are deceived, for the General is certainly
for the King's interest, and so they will not be able to prevail that
way with him. After supper the two knights went on board the Grantham,
that is to convey them to Flushing. I am informed that the Exchequer
is now so low, that there is not L20 there, to give the messenger that
brought the news of Lambert's being taken; which story is very strange
that he should lose his reputation of being a man of courage now at
one blow, for that he was not able to fight one stroke, but desired of
Colonel Ingoldsby several times for God's sake to let him escape. Late
reading my letters, my mind being much troubled to think that, after
all our hopes, we should have any cause to fear any more disappointments
therein. To bed. This day I made even with Mr. Creed, by sending him my
bill and he me my money by Burr whom I sent for it.

28th. This morning sending a packet by Mr. Dunne to London. In the
afternoon I played at ninepins with Mr. Pickering, I and Mr. Pett
against him and Ted Osgood, and won a crown apiece of him. He had not
money enough to pay me. After supper my Lord exceeding merry, and he and
I and W. Howe to sing, and so to bed.

29th (Sunday). This day I put on first my fine cloth suit made of a
cloak that had like to have been [dirted] a year ago, the very day that
I put it on. After sermon in the morning Mr. Cook came from London with
a packet, bringing news how all the young lords that were not in arms
against the Parliament do now sit. That a letter is come from the King
to the House, which is locked up by the Council 'till next Tuesday
that it may be read in the open House when they meet again, they having
adjourned till then to keep a fast tomorrow. And so the contents is not
yet known. L13,000 of the L20,000 given to General Monk is paid out of
the Exchequer, he giving L12 among the teller clerks of Exchequer. My
Lord called me into the great cabin below, where I opened my letters and
he told me that the Presbyterians are quite mastered by the Cavaliers,
and that he fears Mr. Crew did go a little too far the other day in
keeping out the young lords from sitting. That he do expect that the
King should be brought over suddenly, without staying to make any terms
at all, saying that the Presbyterians did intend to have brought him
in with such conditions as if he had been in chains. But he shook his
shoulders when he told me how Monk had betrayed him, for it was he that
did put them upon standing to put out the lords and other members that
came not within the qualifications, which he [Montagu] did not like, but
however he [Monk] had done his business, though it be with some kind
of baseness. After dinner I walked a great while upon the deck with the
chyrurgeon and purser, and other officers of the ship, and they all pray
for the King's coming, which I pray God send.

30th. All the morning getting instructions ready for the Squadron of
ships that are going to-day to the Streights, among others Captain
Teddiman, Curtis, and Captain Robert Blake to be commander of the whole
Squadron. After dinner to ninepins, W. Howe and I against Mr. Creed and
the Captain. We lost 5s. apiece to them. After that W. Howe, Mr. Sheply
and I got my Lord's leave to go to see Captain Sparling. So we took boat
and first went on shore, it being very pleasant in the fields; but a
very pitiful town Deal is. We went to Fuller's (the famous place for
ale), but they have none but what was in the vat. After that to Poole's,
a tavern in the town, where we drank, and so to boat again, and went to
the Assistance, where we were treated very civilly by the Captain, and
he did give us such music upon the harp by a fellow that he keeps on
board that I never expect to hear the like again, yet he is a drunken
simple fellow to look on as any I ever saw. After that on board the
Nazeby, where we found my Lord at supper, so I sat down and very
pleasant my Lord was with Mr. Creed and Sheply, who he puzzled about
finding out the meaning of the three notes which my Lord had cut over
the chrystal of his watch. After supper some musique. Then Mr. Sheply,
W. Howe and I up to the Lieutenant's cabin, where we drank, and I and W.
Howe were very merry, and among other frolics he pulls out the spigot of
the little vessel of ale that was there in the cabin and drew some into
his mounteere, and after he had drank, I endeavouring to dash it in his
face, he got my velvet studying cap and drew some into mine too, that
we made ourselves a great deal of mirth, but spoiled my clothes with the
ale that we dashed up and down. After that to bed very late with drink
enough in my head.




MAY 1660

May 1st. This morning I was told how the people of Deal have set up two
or three Maypoles, and have hung up their flags upon the top of them,
and do resolve to be very merry to-day. It being a very pleasant day, I
wished myself in Hide Park. This day I do count myself to have had full
two years of perfect cure for the stone, for which God of heaven
be blessed. This day Captain Parker came on board, and without his
expectation I had a commission for him for the Nonsuch frigate

     [The "Nonsuch" was a fourth-rate of thirty-two guns, built at
     Deptford in 1646 by Peter Pett, jun.  The captain was John Parker.]

(he being now in the Cheriton), for which he gave me a French pistole.
Captain H. Cuttance has commission for the Cheriton. After dinner to
nine-pins, and won something. The rest of the afternoon in my cabin
writing and piping. While we were at supper we heard a great noise upon
the Quarter Deck, so we all rose instantly, and found it was to save the
coxon of the Cheriton, who, dropping overboard, could not be saved, but
was drowned. To-day I put on my suit that was altered from the great
skirts to little ones. To-day I hear they were very merry at Deal,
setting up the King's flag upon one of their maypoles, and drinking his
health upon their knees in the streets, and firing the guns, which the
soldiers of the Castle threatened; but durst not oppose.

2nd. In the morning at a breakfast of radishes at the Purser's cabin.
After that to writing till dinner. At which time comes Dunne from
London, with letters that tell us the welcome news of the Parliament's
votes yesterday, which will be remembered for the happiest May-day that
bath been many a year to England. The King's letter was read in the
House, wherein he submits himself and all things to them, as to an Act
of Oblivion to all,

     ["His Majesty added thereunto an excellent Declaration for the
     safety and repose of those, who tortured in their consciences, for
     having partaken in the rebellion, might fear the punishment of it,
     and in that fear might oppose the tranquillity of the Estate, and
     the calling in of their lawful Prince.  It is printed and published
     as well as the letter, but that shall not hinder me to say, that
     there was never seen a more perfect assemblage of all the most
     excellent natural qualities, and of all the venues, as well Royal as
     Christian, wherewith a great Prince may be endowed, than was found
     in those two wonderful productions."--Sir William Lowers 'Relation
 ... of the voiage and Residence Which...  Charles the II.
     Hath made in Holland,' Hague, 1660, folio, p. 3.]

unless they shall please to except any, as to the confirming of the
sales of the King's and Church lands, if they see good. The House upon
reading the letter, ordered L50,000 to be forthwith provided to send to
His Majesty for his present supply; and a committee chosen to return an
answer of thanks to His Majesty for his gracious letter; and that the
letter be kept among the records of the Parliament; and in all this not
so much as one No. So that Luke Robinson himself stood up and made a
recantation for what he had done, and promises to be a loyal subject
to his Prince for the time to come. The City of London have put a
Declaration, wherein they do disclaim their owing any other government
but that of a King, Lords, and Commons. Thanks was given by the House to
Sir John Greenville,

     [Created Earl of Bath, 1661; son of Sir Bevil Grenville, killed at
     the battle of Lansdowne; he was, when a boy, left for dead on the
     field at the second battle of Newbury, and said to have been the
     only person entrusted by Charles II. and Monk in bringing about the
     Restoration.]

one of the bedchamber to the King, who brought the letter, and they
continued bare all the time it was reading. Upon notice made from the
Lords to the Commons, of their desire that the Commons would join with
them in their vote for King, Lords, and Commons; the Commons did concur
and voted that all books whatever that are out against the Government of
King, Lords, and Commons, should be brought into the House and burned.
Great joy all yesterday at London, and at night more bonfires than ever,
and ringing of bells, and drinking of the King's health upon their knees
in the streets, which methinks is a little too much. But every
body seems to be very joyfull in the business, insomuch that our
sea-commanders now begin to say so too, which a week ago they would not
do.

     ["The picture of King Charles II. was often set up in houses,
     without the least molestation, whereas a while ago, it was almost a
     hanging matter so to do; but now the Rump Parliament was so hated
     and jeered at, that the butchers' boys would say, 'Will you buy any
     Parliament rumps and kidneys?'  And it was a very ordinary thing to
     see little children make a fire in the streets, and burn rumps."
     --Rugge's Diurnal.--B.]

And our seamen, as many as had money or credit for drink, did do nothing
else this evening. This day came Mr. North (Sir Dudley North's son) on
board, to spend a little time here, which my Lord was a little troubled
at, but he seems to be a fine gentleman, and at night did play his part
exceeding well at first sight. After musique I went up to the Captain's
Cabin with him and Lieutenant Ferrers, who came hither to-day from
London to bring this news to my Lord, and after a bottle of wine we all
to bed.

3d. This morning my Lord showed me the King's declaration and his letter
to the two Generals to be communicated to the fleet.

     ["King Charles II. his Declaration to all his loving Subjects of the
     Kingdome of England, dated from his Court at Breda in Holland 4/14
     of April, 1660, and read in Parliament with his Majesties Letter of
     the same date to his Excellence the Ld. Gen. Monck to be
     communicated to the Ld. President of the Council of State and
     to the Officers of the Army under his Command.  London, Printed by
     W. Godbid for John Playford in the Temple, 1660."  40, pp. 8.]

The contents of the letter are his offer of grace to all that will come
in within forty days, only excepting them that the Parliament shall
hereafter except. That the sales of lands during these troubles, and all
other things, shall be left to the Parliament, by which he will stand.
The letter dated at Breda, April, 4 1660, in the 12th year of his reign.
Upon the receipt of it this morning by an express, Mr. Phillips, one
of the messengers of the Council from General Monk, my Lord summoned a
council of war, and in the mean time did dictate to me how he would have
the vote ordered which he would have pass this council. Which done,
the Commanders all came on board, and the council sat in the coach (the
first council of war that had been in my time), where I read the letter
and declaration; and while they were discoursing upon it, I seemed to
draw up a vote, which being offered, they passed. Not one man seemed to
say no to it, though I am confident many in their hearts were against
it. After this was done, I went up to the quarter-deck with my Lord and
the Commanders, and there read both the papers and the vote; which done,
and demanding their opinion, the seamen did all of them cry out, "God
bless King Charles!" with the greatest joy imaginable. That being done,
Sir R. Stayner, who had invited us yesterday, took all the Commanders
and myself on board him to dinner, which not being ready, I went with
Captain Hayward to the Plimouth and Essex, and did what I had to do
there and returned, where very merry at dinner. After dinner, to the
rest of the ships (staid at the Assistance to hear the harper a good
while) quite through the fleet. Which was a very brave sight to visit
all the ships, and to be received with the respect and honour that I was
on board them all; and much more to see the great joy that I brought to
all men; not one through the whole fleet showing the least dislike of
the business. In the evening as I was going on board the Vice-Admiral,
the General began to fire his guns, which he did all that he had in the
ship, and so did all the rest of the Commanders, which was very gallant,
and to hear the bullets go hissing over our heads as we were in the
boat. This done and finished my Proclamation, I returned to the Nazeby,
where my Lord was much pleased to hear how all the fleet took it in a
transport of joy, showed me a private letter of the King's to him, and
another from the Duke of York in such familiar style as to their common
friend, with all kindness imaginable. And I found by the letters, and
so my Lord told me too, that there had been many letters passed between
them for a great while, and I perceive unknown to Monk. And among the
rest that had carried these letters Sir John Boys is one, and that Mr.
Norwood, which had a ship to carry him over the other day, when my Lord
would not have me put down his name in the book. The King speaks of
his being courted to come to the Hague, but do desire my Lord's advice
whither to come to take ship. And the Duke offers to learn the seaman's
trade of him, in such familiar words as if Jack Cole and I had writ
them. This was very strange to me, that my Lord should carry all things
so wisely and prudently as he do, and I was over joyful to see him in so
good condition, and he did not a little please himself to tell me how he
had provided for himself so great a hold on the King.

After this to supper, and then to writing of letters till twelve at
night, and so up again at three in the morning. My Lord seemed to put
great confidence in me, and would take my advice in many things. I
perceive his being willing to do all the honour in the world to Monk,
and to let him have all the honour of doing the business, though he will
many times express his thoughts of him to be but a thick-sculled fool.
So that I do believe there is some agreement more than ordinary between
the King and my Lord to let Monk carry on the business, for it is he
that must do the business, or at least that can hinder it, if he be not
flattered and observed. This, my Lord will hint himself sometimes. My
Lord, I perceive by the King's letter, had writ to him about his father,
Crew,--[When only seventeen years old, Montagu had married Jemima,
daughter of John Crew, created afterwards Baron Crew of Stene.]--and the
King did speak well of him; but my Lord tells me, that he is afeard that
he hath too much concerned himself with the Presbyterians against the
House of Lords, which will do him a great discourtesy.

4th. I wrote this morning many letters, and to all the copies of the
vote of the council of war I put my name, that if it should come in
print my name maybe at it. I sent a copy of the vote to Doling, inclosed
in this letter:

     "SIR,

     "He that can fancy a fleet (like ours) in her pride, with pendants
     loose, guns roaring, caps flying, and the loud 'Vive le Roys,'
     echoed from one ship's company to another, he, and he only, can
     apprehend the joy this inclosed vote was received with, or the
     blessing he thought himself possessed of that bore it, and is

                                   "Your humble servant."

About nine o'clock I got all my letters done, and sent them by the
messenger that came yesterday. This morning came Captain Isham on board
with a gentleman going to the King, by whom very cunningly, my Lord
tells me, he intends to send an account of this day's and yesterday's
actions here, notwithstanding he had writ to the Parliament to have
leave of them to send the King the answer of the fleet. Since my writing
of the last paragraph, my Lord called me to him to read his letter to
the King, to see whether I could find any slips in it or no. And as much
of the letter' as I can remember, is thus:

     "May it please your Most Excellent Majesty," and so begins.

     "That he yesterday received from General Monk his Majesty's letter
     and direction; and that General Monk had desired him to write to the
     Parliament to have leave to send the vote of the seamen before he
     did send it to him, which he had done by writing to both Speakers;
     but for his private satisfaction he had sent it thus privately (and
     so the copy of the proceedings yesterday was sent him), and that
     this come by a gentleman that came this day on board, intending to
     wait upon his Majesty, that he is my Lord's countryman, and one
     whose friends have suffered much on his Majesty's behalf.  That my
     Lords Pembroke and Salisbury are put out of the House of Lords.
     That my Lord is very joyful that other countries do pay him the
     civility and respect due to him; and that he do much rejoice to see
     that the King do resolve to receive none of their assistance (or
     some such words), from them, he having strength enough in the love
     and loyalty of his own subjects to support him.  That his Majesty
     had chosen the best place, Scheveling,--[Schevingen, the port of the
     Hague]--for his embarking, and that there is nothing in the world of
     which he is more ambitious, than to have the honour of attending his
     Majesty, which he hoped would be speedy.  That he had commanded the
     vessel to attend at Helversluce--[Hellevoetsluis, in South Holland]
     --till this gentleman returns, that so if his Majesty do not think
     it fit to command the fleet himself, yet that he may be there to
     receive his commands and bring them to his Lordship.  He ends his
     letter, that he is confounded with the thoughts of the high
     expressions of love to him in the King's letter, and concludes,

     "Your most loyall, dutifull, faithfull and obedient subject and
     servant, E. M."

The rest of the afternoon at ninepins. In the evening came a packet from
London, among the rest a letter from my wife, which tells me that she
has not been well, which did exceedingly trouble me, but my Lord sending
Mr. Cook at night, I wrote to her and sent a piece of gold enclosed to
her, and wrote also to Mrs. Bowyer, and enclosed a half piece to her
for a token. After supper at the table in the coach, my Lord talking
concerning the uncertainty of the places of the Exchequer to them that
had them now; he did at last think of an office which do belong to him
in case the King do restore every man to his places that ever had been
patent, which is to be one of the clerks of the signet, which will be a
fine employment for one of his sons. After all this discourse we broke
up and to bed.

In the afternoon came a minister on board, one Mr. Sharpe, who is going
to the King; who tells me that Commissioners are chosen both of Lords
and Commons to go to the King; and that Dr. Clarges

     [Thomas Clarges, physician to the army, created a baronet, 1674,
     died 1695.  He had been previously knighted; his sister Anne married
     General Monk.  "The Parliament also permitted General Monk to send
     Mr. Clarges, his brother-in-law, accompanied with some officers of
     the army, to assure his Majesty of the fidelity and obedience of the
     army, which had made publick and solemn protestations thereof, after
     the Letter and Declaration was communicated unto them by the
     General."--Sir William Lowers Relation... of the Voiage and
     Residence which... Charles the II.  Hath made in Holland,
     Hague, 1660, folio.]

is going to him from the Army, and that he will be here to-morrow. My
letters at night tell me, that the House did deliver their letter to Sir
John Greenville, in answer to the King's sending, and that they give
him L500 for his pains, to buy him a jewel, and that besides the L50,000
ordered to be borrowed of the City for the present use of the King, the
twelve companies of the City do give every one of them to his Majesty,
as a present, L1000.

5th. All the morning very busy writing letters to London, and a packet
to Mr. Downing, to acquaint him with what had been done lately in the
fleet. And this I did by my Lord's command, who, I thank him, did of
himself think of doing it, to do me a kindness, for he writ a letter
himself to him, thanking him for his kindness to me. All the afternoon
at ninepins, at night after supper good musique, my Lord, Mr. North, I
and W. Howe. After that to bed. This evening came Dr. Clarges to Deal,
going to the King; where the towns-people strewed the streets with
herbes against his coming, for joy of his going. Never was there so
general a content as there is now. I cannot but remember that our parson
did, in his prayer to-night, pray for the long life and happiness of
our King and dread Soveraign, that may last as long as the sun and moon
endureth.

6th (Lord's day). This morning while we were at sermon comes in Dr.
Clarges and a dozen gentlemen to see my Lord, who, after sermon,
dined with him; I remember that last night upon discourse
concerning Clarges my Lord told me that he was a man of small
entendimiento.--[Entendimiento, Spanish: the understanding.]--This
afternoon there was a gentleman with me, an officer of Dunkirk going
over, who came to me for an order and told me he was lately with my
uncle and Aunt Fenner and that Kate's fits of the convulsions did hold
her still. It fell very well to-day, a stranger preached here for Mr.
Ibbot, one Mr. Stanley, who prayed for King Charles, by the Grace of
God, &c., which gave great contentment to the gentlemen that were on
board here, and they said they would talk of it, when they come to
Breda, as not having it done yet in London so publickly. After they were
gone from on board, my Lord writ a letter to the King and give it to
me to carry privately to Sir William Compton' on board the Assistance,
which I did, and after a health to his Majesty on board there, I left
them under sail for Breda. Back again and found them at sermon. I went
up to my cabin and looked over my accounts, and find that, all my debts
paid and my preparations to sea paid for, I have L640 clear in my purse.
After supper to bed.

7th. This morning Captain Cuttance sent me 12 bottles of Margate ale.
Three of them I drank presently with some friends in the Coach. My
Lord went this morning about the flag-ships in a boat, to see what
alterations there must be, as to the arms and flags. He did give me
order also to write for silk flags and scarlett waistcloathes.

     [Waist-cloths are the painted canvas coverings of the hammocks which
     are stowed in the waist-nettings.]

For a rich barge; for a noise of trumpets,

     [A set or company of musicians, an expression constantly used by old
     writers without any disparaging meaning.  It is sometimes applied to
     voices as well as to instruments.]

and a set of fidlers. Very great deal of company come today, among
others Mr. Bellasses, Sir Thomas Lenthropp, Sir Henry Chichley, Colonel
Philip Honiwood, and Captain Titus, the last of whom my Lord showed all
our cabins, and I suppose he is to take notice what room there will be
for the King's entertainment. Here were also all the Jurates of the town
of Dover come to give my Lord a visit, and after dinner all went away.
I could not but observe that the Vice-Admiral after dinner came into the
great cabin below, where the Jurates and I and the commanders for want
of room dined, and there told us we must drink a health to the King,
and himself called for a bottle of wine, and begun his and the Duke of
York's. In the afternoon I lost 5s. at ninepins. After supper musique,
and to bed. Having also among us at the Coach table wrote a letter to
the French ambassador, in French, about the release of a ship we had
taken. After I was in bed Mr. Sheply and W. Howe came and sat in my
cabin, where I gave them three bottles of Margate ale, and sat laughing
and very merry, till almost one o'clock in the morning, and so good
night.

8th. All the morning busy. After dinner come several persons of honour,
as my Lord St. John and others, for convoy to Flushing, and great giving
of them salutes. My Lord and we at nine-pins: I lost 9s. While we were
at play Mr. Cook brings me word of my wife. He went to Huntsmore to see
her, and brought her and my father Bowyer to London, where he left her
at my father's, very well, and speaks very well of her love to me.
My letters to-day tell me how it was intended that the King should be
proclaimed to-day in London, with a great deal of pomp. I had also news
who they are that are chosen of the Lords and Commons to attend the
King. And also the whole story of what we did the other day in the
fleet, at reading of the King's declaration, and my name at the bottom
of it. After supper some musique and to bed. I resolving to rise betimes
to-morrow to write letters to London.

9th. Up very early, writing a letter to the King, as from the two
Generals of the fleet, in answer to his letter to them, wherein my Lord
do give most humble thanks for his gracious letter and declaration; and
promises all duty and obedience to him. This letter was carried this
morning to Sir Peter Killigrew,

     [Sir Peter Killigrew, Knight, of Arwenack, Cornwall, was known as
     "Peter the Post," from the alacrity with which he despatched "like
     wild fire" all the messages and other commissions entrusted to him
     in the King's cause.  His son Peter, who succeeded his uncle as
     second baronet in 1665, was M.P. for Camelford in 1660.]

who came hither this morning early to bring an order from the Lords'
House to my Lord, giving him power to write an answer to the King. This
morning my Lord St. John and other persons of honour were here to see
my Lord, and so away to Flushing. After they were gone my Lord and I
to write letters to London, which we sent by Mr. Cook, who was very
desirous to go because of seeing my wife before she went out of town.
As we were sitting down to dinner, in comes Noble with a letter from the
House of Lords to my Lord, to desire him to provide ships to transport
the Commissioners to the King, which are expected here this week. He
brought us certain news that the King was proclaimed yesterday with
great pomp, and brought down one of the Proclamations, with great joy to
us all; for which God be praised. After dinner to ninepins and lost 5s.
This morning came Mr. Saunderson,

     [Afterwards Sir William Sanderson, gentleman of the chamber, author
     of the "History of Mary Queen of Scots, James I., and Charles I."
     His wife, Dame Bridget, was mother of the maids.]

that writ the story of the King, hither, who is going over to the King.
He calls me cozen and seems a very knowing man. After supper to bed
betimes, leaving my Lord talking in the Coach with the Captain.

10th. This morning came on board Mr. Pinkney and his son, going to the
King with a petition finely writ by Mr. Whore, for to be the King's
embroiderer; for whom and Mr. Saunderson I got a ship. This morning come
my Lord Winchelsea and a great deal of company, and dined here. In
the afternoon, while my Lord and we were at musique in the great cabin
below, comes in a messenger to tell us that Mr. Edward Montagu,

     [Sir Edward Montagu's eldest son, afterwards second Earl of
     Sandwich, called by Pepys "The child."]

my Lord's son, was come to Deal, who afterwards came on board with Mr.
Pickering with him. The child was sick in the evening. At night,
while my Lord was at supper, in comes my Lord Lauderdale and Sir John
Greenville, who supped here, and so went away. After they were gone, my
Lord called me into his cabin, and told me how he was commanded to set
sail presently for the King,

     ["Ordered that General Montagu do observe the command of His Majesty
     for the disposing of the fleet, in order to His Majesty's returning
     home to England to his kingly government: and that all proceedings
     in law be in His Majesty's name."--Rugge's Diurnal.--B.]

and was very glad thereof, and so put me to writing of letters and
other work that night till it was very late, he going to bed. I got him
afterwards to sign things in bed. After I had done some more work I to
bed also.

11th. Up very early in the morning, and so about a great deal of
business in order to our going hence to-day. Burr going on shore last
night made me very angry. So that I sent for Mr. Pitts to come tome from
the Vice-Admiral's, intending not to have employed Burr any more. But
Burr by and by coming and desiring humbly that I would forgive him and
Pitts not coming I did set him to work. This morning we began to pull
down all the State's arms in the fleet, having first sent to Dover
for painters and others to come to set up the King's. The rest of the
morning writing of letters to London which I afterwards sent by Dunne. I
had this morning my first opportunity of discoursing with Dr. Clarke,

     [Timothy Clarke, M. D., one of the original Fellows of the Royal
     Society.  He was appointed one of the physicians in ordinary to
     Charles II.  on the death of Dr. Quartermaine in 1667.]

whom I found to be a very pretty man and very knowing. He is now going
in this ship to the King. There dined here my Lord Crafford and my Lord
Cavendish, and other Scotchmen whom I afterwards ordered to be received
on board the Plymouth, and to go along with us. After dinner we set
sail from the Downs, I leaving my boy to go to Deal for my linen. In the
afternoon overtook us three or four gentlemen; two of the Berties, and
one Mr. Dormerhoy, a Scotch gentleman, whom I afterwards found to be a
very fine man, who, telling my Lord that they heard the Commissioners
were come out of London to-day, my Lord dropt anchor over against Dover
Castle (which give us about thirty guns in passing), and upon a high
debate with the Vice and Rear Admiral whether it were safe to go and
not stay for the Commissioners, he did resolve to send Sir R. Stayner to
Dover, to enquire of my Lord Winchelsea, whether or no they are come out
of London, and then to resolve to-morrow morning of going or not; which
was done. It blew very hard all this night that I was afeard of my
boy. About 11 at night came the boats from Deal, with great store of
provisions, by the same token John Goods told me that above 20 of the
fowls are smothered, but my boy was put on board the Northwich. To bed.

12th. This morning I inquired for my boy, whether he was come well or
no, and it was told me that he was well in bed. My Lord called me to his
chamber, he being in bed, and gave me many orders to make for direction
for the ships that are left in the Downs, giving them the greatest
charge in the world to bring no passengers with them, when they come
after us to Scheveling Bay, excepting Mr. Edward Montagu, Mr. Thomas
Crew, and Sir H. Wright. Sir R. Stayner hath been here early in the
morning and told my Lord, that my Lord Winchelsea understands by
letters, that the Commissioners are only to come to Dover to attend the
coming over of the King. So my Lord did give order for weighing anchor,
which we did, and sailed all day. In our way in the morning, coming
in the midway between Dover and Calais, we could see both places very
easily, and very pleasant it was to me that the further we went the more
we lost sight of both lands. In the afternoon at cards with Mr. North
and the Doctor.--[Clarke]--There by us, in the Lark frigate, Sir R.
Freeman and some others, going from the King to England, come to see
my Lord and so onward on their voyage. In the afternoon upon the
quarterdeck the Doctor told Mr. North and me an admirable story called
"The Fruitless Precaution," an exceeding pretty story and worthy my
getting without book when I can get the book.[??] This evening came Mr.
Sheply on board, whom we had left at Deal and Dover getting of provision
and borrowing of money. In the evening late, after discoursing with the
Doctor, &c., to bed.

13th (Lord's day). Trimmed in the morning, after that to the cook's room
with Mr. Sheply, the first time that I was there this voyage. Then to
the quarter-deck, upon which the tailors and painters were at work,
cutting out some pieces of yellow cloth into the fashion of a crown and
C. R. and put it upon a fine sheet, and that into the flag instead of
the State's arms, which after dinner was finished and set up after
it had been shewn to my Lord, who took physic to-day and was in his
chamber, and liked it so well as to bid me give the tailors 20s. among
them for doing of it. This morn Sir J. Boys and Capt. Isham met us in
the Nonsuch, the first of whom, after a word or two with my Lord, went
forward, the other staid. I heard by them how Mr. Downing had never
made any address to the King, and for that was hated exceedingly by the
Court, and that he was in a Dutch ship which sailed by us, then going
to England with disgrace. Also how Mr. Morland was knighted by the King
this week, and that the King did give the reason of it openly, that
it was for his giving him intelligence all the time he was clerk to
Secretary Thurloe. In the afternoon a council of war, only to acquaint
them that the Harp must be taken out of all their flags,

     [In May, 1658, the old Union Jack (being the crosses of St. George
     and St. Andrew combined) was revived, with the Irish harp over the
     centre of the flag.  This harp was taken off at the Restoration.
     (See "The National Flags of the Commonwealth," by H. W. Henfrey,"
     Journ. Brit.  Arch.  Assoc.," vol.  xxxi, p. 54.) The sign of the
     "Commonwealth Arms" was an uncommon one, but a token of one exists--
     "Francis Wood at ye Commonwealth arms in Mary Maudlens" [St. Mary
     Magdalen, Old Fish Street].]

it being very offensive to the King. Mr. Cook, who came after us in the
Yarmouth, bringing me a letter from my wife and a Latin letter from my
brother John, with both of which I was exceedingly pleased. No sermon
all day, we being under sail, only at night prayers, wherein Mr. Ibbott
prayed for all that were related to us in a spiritual and fleshly way.
We came within sight of Middle's shore. Late at night we writ letters
to the King of the news of our coming, and Mr. Edward Picketing carried
them. Capt. Isham went on shore, nobody showing of him any respect; so
the old man very fairly took leave of my Lord, and my Lord very coldly
bid him "God be with you," which was very strange, but that I hear that
he keeps a great deal of prating and talking on shore, on board, at the
King's Courts, what command he had with my Lord, &c. After letters were
gone then to bed.

14th. In the morning when I woke and rose, I saw myself out of the
scuttle close by the shore, which afterwards I was told to be the Dutch
shore; the Hague was clearly to be seen by us. My Lord went up in his
nightgown into the cuddy,

     ["A sort of cabin or cook-room, generally in the fore-part, but
     sometimes near the stern of lighters and barges of burden."--Smyth's
     Sailor's Word-Book.]

to see how to dispose thereof for himself and us that belong to him, to
give order for our removal to-day. Some nasty Dutchmen came on board to
proffer their boats to carry things from us on shore, &c., to get money
by us. Before noon some gentlemen came on board from the shore to kiss
my Lord's hands. And by and by Mr. North and Dr. Clerke went to kiss the
Queen of Bohemia's' hands, from my Lord, with twelve attendants from on
board to wait on them, among which I sent my boy, who, like myself, is
with child to see any strange thing. After noon they came back again
after having kissed the Queen of Bohemia's hand, and were sent again by
my Lord to do the same to the Prince of Orange.

     [Son of the Prince of Orange and Mary, eldest daughter of Charles I.
     --afterwards William III.  He was then in his tenth year, having
     been born in 1650.]

So I got the Captain to ask leave for me to go, which my Lord did give,
and I taking my boy and judge Advocate with me, went in company with
them. The weather bad; we were sadly washed when we came near the shore,
it being very hard to land there. The shore is, as all the country
between that and the Hague, all sand. The rest of the company got a
coach by themselves; Mr. Creed and I went in the fore part of a coach
wherein were two very pretty ladies, very fashionable and with black
patches, who very merrily sang all the way and that very well, and were
very free to kiss the two blades that were with them. I took out my
flageolette and piped, but in piping I dropped my rapier-stick, but when
I came to the Hague, I sent my boy back again for it and he found it,
for which I did give him 6d., but some horses had gone over it and broke
the scabbard. The Hague is a most neat place in all respects. The houses
so neat in all places and things as is possible. Here we walked up and
down a great while, the town being now very full of Englishmen, for
that the Londoners were come on shore today. But going to see the
Prince,--[Prince of Orange, afterwards William III.]--he was gone forth
with his governor, and so we walked up and down the town and court to
see the place; and by the help of a stranger, an Englishman, we saw
a great many places, and were made to understand many things, as the
intention of may-poles, which we saw there standing at every great man's
door, of different greatness according to the quality of the person.
About 10 at night the Prince comes home, and we found an easy admission.
His attendance very inconsiderable as for a prince; but yet handsome,
and his tutor a fine man, and himself a very pretty boy. It was bright
moonshine to-night. This done we went to a place we had taken to sup
in, where a sallet and two or three bones of mutton were provided for a
matter of ten of us which was very strange. After supper the Judge and I
to another house, leaving them there, and he and I lay in one press bed,
there being two more in the same room, but all very neat and handsome,
my boy sleeping upon a bench by me.

15th. We lay till past three o'clock, then up and down the town, to see
it by daylight, where we saw the soldiers of the Prince's guard, all
very fine, and the burghers of the town with their arms and muskets as
bright as silver. And meeting this morning a schoolmaster that spoke
good English and French, he went along with us and shewed us the whole
town, and indeed I cannot speak enough of the gallantry of the town.
Every body of fashion speaks French or Latin, or both. The women many
of them very pretty and in good habits, fashionable and black spots. He
went with me to buy a couple of baskets, one of them for Mrs. Pierce,
the other for my wife. After he was gone, we having first drank with him
at our lodging, the judge and I to the Grande Salle where we were shewed
the place where the States General sit in council. The hall is a great
place, where the flags that they take from their enemies are all hung
up; and things to be sold, as in Westminster Hall, and not much unlike
it, but that not so big, but much neater. After that to a bookseller's
and bought for the love of the binding three books: the French Psalms in
four parts, Bacon's Organon, and Farnab. Rhetor.

     ["Index Rhetoricus" of Thomas Farnaby was a book which went through
     several editions.  The first was published at London by R. Allot in
     1633.]

After that the judge, I and my boy by coach to Scheveling again, where
we went into a house of entertainment and drank there, the wind being
very high, and we saw two boats overset and the gallants forced to be
pulled on shore by the heels, while their trunks, portmanteaus, hats,
and feathers, were swimming in the sea. Among others I saw the ministers
that come along with the Commissioners (Mr. Case among the rest) sadly
dipped.

     [Thomas Case, born 1598, was a famous preacher and a zealous
     advocate for the Solemn League and Covenant, a member of the
     assembly of divines, and rector of St. Giles's-in-the-Fields.  He
     was one of the deputation to Charles II.  at Breda, and appointed a
     royal chaplain.  He was ejected by the Act of Uniformity, but
     remained in London after his ejection.  Died May 30th, 1682.]

So they came in where we were, and I being in haste left my Copenhagen
knife, and so lost it. Having staid here a great while a gentleman that
was going to kiss my Lord's hand, from the Queen of Bohemia, and I hired
a Dutch boat for four rixdollars to carry us on board. We were fain to
wait a great while before we could get off from the shore, the sea being
very rough. The Dutchman would fain have made all pay that came into
our boat besides us two and our company, there being many of our ship's
company got in who were on shore, but some of them had no money, having
spent all on shore. Coming on board we found all the Commissioners of
the House of Lords at dinner with my Lord, who after dinner went away
for shore. Mr. Morland, now Sir Samuel, was here on board, but I do not
find that my Lord or any body did give him any respect, he being looked
upon by him and all men as a knave. Among others he betrayed Sir Rich.
Willis

     [This is somewhat different to the usual account of Morland's
     connection with Sir Richard Willis.  In the beginning of 1659
     Cromwell, Thurloe, and Willis formed a plot to inveigle Charles II.
     into England and into the hands of his enemies.  The plot was
     discussed in Thurloe's office, and Morland, who pretended to be
     asleep, heard it and discovered it.  Willis sent for Morland, and
     received him in a cellar.  He said that one of them must have
     discovered the plot.  He laid his hand upon the Bible and swore that
     he had not been the discoverer, calling upon Morland to do the same.
     Morland, with presence of mind, said he was ready to do so if Willis
     would give him a reason why he should suspect him.  By this ready
     answer he is said to have escaped the ordeal (see Birch's "Life of
     Thurloe").]

that married Dr. F. Jones's daughter, that he had paid him L1000 at one
time by the Protector's and Secretary Thurloe's order, for intelligence
that he sent concerning the King. In the afternoon my Lord called me
on purpose to show me his fine cloathes which are now come hither, and
indeed are very rich as gold and silver can make them, only his sword he
and I do not like. In the afternoon my Lord and I walked together in
the coach two hours, talking together upon all sorts of discourse: as
religion, wherein he is, I perceive, wholly sceptical, as well as I,
saying, that indeed the Protestants as to the Church of Rome are
wholly fanatiques: he likes uniformity and form of prayer; about
State-business, among other things he told me that his conversion to
the King's cause (for so I was saying that I wondered from what time the
King could look upon him to become his friend), commenced from his being
in the Sound, when he found what usage he was likely to have from a
Commonwealth. My Lord, the Captain, and I supped in my Lord's chamber,
where I did perceive that he did begin to show me much more respect than
ever he did yet. After supper, my Lord sent for me, intending to have
me play at cards with him, but I not knowing cribbage, we fell into
discourse of many things, till it was so rough sea and the ship rolled
so much that I was not able to stand, and so he bid me go to bed.

16th. Soon as I was up I went down to be trimmed below in the great
cabin, but then come in some with visits, among the rest one from
Admiral Opdam,

     [The admiral celebrated in Lord Dorset's ballad, "To all you ladies
     now at land."

                   "Should foggy Opdam chance to know
                    Our sad and dismal story;
                    The Dutch would scorn so weak a foe,
                    And quit their fort at Goree
                    For what resistance can they find
                    From men who've left their hearts behind?"--B.]

who spoke Latin well, but not French nor English, to whom my Lord made
me to give his answer and to entertain; he brought my Lord a tierce of
wine and a barrel of butter, as a present from the Admiral. After that
to finish my trimming, and while I was doing of it in comes Mr. North
very sea-sick from shore, and to bed he goes. After that to dinner,
where Commissioner Pett was come to take care to get all things ready
for the King on board. My Lord in his best suit, this the first day, in
expectation to wait upon the King. But Mr. Edw. Pickering coming from
the King brought word that the King would not put my Lord to the trouble
of coming to him; but that he would come to the shore to look upon the
fleet to-day, which we expected, and had our guns ready to fire, and
our scarlet waistcloathes out and silk pendants, but he did not come. My
Lord and we at ninepins this afternoon upon the Quarterdeck, which was
very pretty sport. This evening came Mr. John Pickering on board, like
an ass, with his feathers and new suit that he had made at the Hague. My
Lord very angry for his staying on shore, bidding me a little before to
send to him, telling me that he was afraid that for his father's sake he
might have some mischief done him, unless he used the General's name. To
supper, and after supper to cards. I stood by and looked on till 11 at
night and so to bed. This afternoon Mr. Edwd. Pickering told me in what
a sad, poor condition for clothes and money the King was, and all his
attendants, when he came to him first from my Lord, their clothes not
being worth forty shillings the best of them.

     [Andrew Marvell alludes to the poor condition, for clothes and
     money, in which the King was at this time, in "A Historical Poem":--

               "At length, by wonderful impulse of fate,
               The people call him back to help the State;
               And what is more, they send him money, too,
               And clothe him all from head to foot anew."]

And how overjoyed the King was when Sir J. Greenville brought him some
money; so joyful, that he called the Princess Royal and Duke of York to
look upon it as it lay in the portmanteau before it was taken out.
My Lord told me, too, that the Duke of York is made High Admiral of
England.

17th. Up early to write down my last two days' observations. Dr. Clerke
came to me to tell me that he heard this morning, by some Dutch that are
come on board already to see the ship, that there was a Portuguese taken
yesterday at the Hague, that had a design to kill the King. But this I
heard afterwards was only the mistake upon one being observed to walk
with his sword naked, he having lost his scabbard. Before dinner Mr.
Edw. Pickering and I, W. Howe, Pim, and my boy,--[Edward Montagu,
afterwards Lord Hinchinbroke.]--to Scheveling, where we took coach, and
so to the Hague, where walking, intending to find one that might show
us the King incognito, I met with Captain Whittington (that had formerly
brought a letter to my Lord from the Mayor of London) and he did promise
me to do it, but first we went and dined at a French house, but paid
16s. for our part of the club. At dinner in came Dr. Cade, a merry mad
parson of the King's. And they two after dinner got the child and me
(the others not being able to crowd in) to see the King, who kissed the
child very affectionately. Then we kissed his, and the Duke of York's,
and the Princess Royal's hands. The King seems to be a very sober man;
and a very splendid Court he hath in the number of persons of quality
that are about him, English very rich in habit. From the King to the
Lord Chancellor,

     [On January 29th, 1658, Charles II.  entrusted the Great Seal to Sir
     Edward Hyde, with the title of Lord Chancellor, and in that
     character Sir Edward accompanied the King to England.]

who did lie bed-rid of the gout: he spoke very merrily to the child
and me. After that, going to see the Queen of Bohemia, I met with Dr.
Fullers whom I sent to a tavern with Mr. Edw. Pickering, while I and
the rest went to see the Queen,--[Henrietta Maria.]--who used us very
respectfully; her hand we all kissed. She seems a very debonaire, but
plain lady. After that to the Dr.'s, where we drank a while or so. In a
coach of a friend's of Dr. Cade we went to see a house of the Princess
Dowager's in a park about half-a-mile or a mile from the Hague, where
there is one, the most beautiful room for pictures in the whole world.
She had here one picture upon the top, with these words, dedicating it
to the memory of her husband:--"Incomparabili marito, inconsolabilis
vidua."

     [Mary, Princess Royal, eldest daughter of Charles I., and widow of
     William of Nassau, Prince of Orange.  She was not supposed to be
     inconsolable, and scandal followed her at the court of Charles II.,
     where she died of small-pox, December 24th, 1660.]

Here I met with Mr. Woodcock of Cambridge, Mr. Hardy and another, and
Mr. Woodcock beginning we had two or three fine songs, he and I, and
W. Howe to the Echo, which was very pleasant, and the more because in a
heaven of pleasure and in a strange country, that I never was taken up
more with a sense of pleasure in my life. After that we parted and back
to the Hague and took a tour or two about the Forehault,--[The Voorhout
is the principal street of the Hague, and it is lined with handsome
trees.]--where the ladies in the evening do as our ladies do in Hide
Park. But for my life I could not find one handsome, but their coaches
very rich and themselves so too. From thence, taking leave of the
Doctor, we took wagon to Scheveling, where we had a fray with the
Boatswain of the Richmond, who would not freely carry us on board, but
at last he was willing to it, but then it was so late we durst not go.
So we returned between 10 and 11 at night in the dark with a wagon with
one horse to the Hague, where being come we went to bed as well as we
could be accommodated, and so to sleep.

18th. Very early up, and, hearing that the Duke of York, our Lord High
Admiral, would go on board to-day, Mr. Pickering and I took waggon for
Scheveling, leaving the child in Mr. Pierces hands, with directions to
keep him within doors all day till he heard from me. But the wind being
very high that no boats could get off from shore, we returned to
the Hague (having breakfasted with a gentleman of the Duke's, and
Commissioner Pett, sent on purpose to give notice to my Lord of his
coming), where I hear that the child is gone to Delfe to see the town.
So we all and Mr. Ibbott, the Minister, took a schuit--[The trekschuit
(drag-boat) along the canal is still described as an agreeable
conveyance from Leyden to Delft.]--and very much pleased with the manner
and conversation of the passengers, where most speak French; went after
them, but met them by the way. But however we went forward making no
stop. Where when we were come we got a smith's boy of the town to go
along with us, but could speak nothing but Dutch, and he showed us the
church where Van Trump lies entombed with a very fine monument. His
epitaph concluded thus:--"Tandem Bello Anglico tantum non victor, certe
invictus, vivere et vincere desiit." There is a sea-fight cut in marble,
with the smoke, the best expressed that ever I saw in my life. From
thence to the great church, that stands in a fine great market-place,
over against the Stadt-house, and there I saw a stately tomb of the
old Prince of Orange, of marble and brass; wherein among other rarities
there are the angels with their trumpets expressed as it were crying.
Here were very fine organs in both the churches. It is a most sweet
town, with bridges, and a river in every street. Observing that in every
house of entertainment there hangs in every room a poor-man's box, and
desiring to know the reason thereof, it was told me that it is their
custom to confirm all bargains by putting something into the poor
people's box, and that binds as fast as any thing. We also saw the
Guesthouse, where it was very pleasant to see what neat preparation
there is for the poor. We saw one poor man a-dying there. After we had
seen all, we light by chance of an English house to drink in, where we
were very merry, discoursing of the town and the thing that hangs up in
the Stadthouse like a bushel, which I was told is a sort of punishment
for some sort of offenders to carry through the streets of the town over
his head, which is a great weight. Back by water, where a pretty sober
Dutch lass sat reading all the way, and I could not fasten any discourse
upon her. At our landing we met with Commissioner Pett going down to the
water-side with Major Harly, who is going upon a dispatch into England.
They having a coach I left the Parson and my boy and went along with
Commissioner Pett, Mr. Ackworth and Mr. Dawes his friends, to the
Princess Dowager's house again. Thither also my Lord Fairfax and some
other English Lords did come to see it, and my pleasure was increased by
seeing of it again. Besides we went into the garden, wherein are gallant
nuts better than ever I saw, and a fine Echo under the house in a vault
made on purpose with pillars, where I played on my flageolette to great
advantage. Back to the Hague, where not finding Mr. Edward, I was much
troubled, but went with the Parson to supper to Commissioner Pett,
where we sat late. And among other mirth Mr. Ackworth vyed wives, each
endeavouring to set his own wife out to the best advantage, he having as
they said an extraordinary handsome wife. But Mr. Dawes could not be got
to say anything of his. After that to our lodging where W. Howe and I
exceeding troubled not to know what is become of our young gentleman. So
to bed.

19th. Up early, hearing nothing of the child, and went to Scheveling,
where I found no getting on board, though the Duke of York sent every
day to see whether he could do it or no. Here I met with Mr. Pinkney and
his sons, and with them went back to the Hague, in our way lighting and
going to see a woman that makes pretty rock-work in shells, &c., which
could I have carried safe I would have bought some of. At the Hague
we went to buy some pictures, where I saw a sort of painting done upon
woollen cloth, drawn as if there was a curtain over it, which was very
pleasant, but dear. Another pretty piece of painting I saw, on which
there was a great wager laid by young Pinkney and me whether it was a
principal or a copy. But not knowing how to decide, it was broken off,
and I got the old man to lay out as much as my piece of gold come to,
and so saved my money, which had been 24s. lost, I fear. While we were
here buying of pictures, we saw Mr. Edward and his company land. Who
told me that they had been at Leyden all night, at which I was very
angry with Mr. Pierce, and shall not be friends I believe a good while.
To our lodging to dinner. After that out to buy some linen to wear
against to-morrow, and so to the barber's. After that by waggon to
Lausdune, where the 365 children were born. We saw the hill where they
say the house stood and sunk wherein the children were born. The basins
wherein the male and female children were baptized do stand over a large
table that hangs upon a wall, with the whole story of the thing in Dutch
and Latin, beginning, "Margarita Herman Comitissa," &c. The thing was
done about 200 years ago.

The town is a little small village which answers much to one of our
small villages, such a one as Chesterton in all respects, and one could
have thought it in England but for the language of the people. We went
into a little drinking house where there were a great many Dutch boors
eating of fish in a boorish manner, but very merry in their way. But
the houses here as neat as in the great places. From thence to the Hague
again playing at crambo--[Crambo is described as "a play at short verses
in which a word is given, and the parties contend who can find most
rhymes to it."]--in the waggon, Mr. Edward, Mr. Ibbott, W. Howe, Mr.
Pinkney, and I. When we were come thither W. Howe, and Mr. Ibbott, and
Mr. Pinckney went away for Scheveling, while I and the child to walk up
and down the town, where I met my old chamber-fellow, Mr. Ch. Anderson,
and a friend of his (both Physicians), Mr. Wright, who took me to a
Dutch house, where there was an exceeding pretty lass, and right for the
sport, but it being Saturday we could not have much of her company,
but however I staid with them (having left the child with my uncle
Pickering, whom I met in the street) till 12 at night. By that time
Charles was almost drunk, and then broke up, he resolving to go thither
again, after he had seen me at my lodging, and lie with the girl, which
he told me he had done in the morning. Going to my lodging we met with
the bellman, who struck upon a clapper, which I took in my hand, and it
is just like the clapper that our boys frighten the birds away from the
corn with in summer time in England. To bed.

20th. Up early, and with Mr. Pickering and the child by waggon to
Scheveling, where it not being yet fit to go off, I went to lie down in
a chamber in the house, where in another bed there was a pretty Dutch
woman in bed alone, but though I had a month's-mind

     [Month's-mind.  An earnest desire or longing, explained as alluding
     to "a woman's longing."  See Shakespeare, "Two Gentlemen of Verona,"
     act i.  sc. 2:

               "I see you have a month's mind to them."--M. B.]

I had not the boldness to go to her. So there I slept an hour or two. At
last she rose, and then I rose and walked up and down the chamber, and
saw her dress herself after the Dutch dress, and talked to her as much
as I could, and took occasion, from her ring which she wore on her first
finger, to kiss her hand, but had not the face to offer anything more.
So at last I left her there and went to my company. About 8 o'clock I
went into the church at Scheveling, which was pretty handsome, and
in the chancel a very great upper part of the mouth of a whale, which
indeed was of a prodigious bigness, bigger than one of our long boats
that belong to one of our ships. Commissioner Pett at last came to our
lodging, and caused the boats to go off; so some in one boat and some in
another we all bid adieu to the shore. But through badness of weather we
were in great danger, and a great while before we could get to the
ship, so that of all the company not one but myself that was not sick.
I keeping myself in the open air, though I was soundly wet for it. This
hath not been known four days together such weather at this time of
year, a great while. Indeed our fleet was thought to be in great danger,
but we found all well, and Mr. Thos. Crew came on board. I having spoke
a word or two with my Lord, being not very well settled, partly through
last night's drinking and want of sleep, I lay down in my gown upon my
bed and slept till the 4 o'clock gun the next morning waked me, which I
took for 8 at night, and rising ... mistook the sun rising for the sun
setting on Sunday night.

21st. So into my naked bed

     [This is a somewhat late use of an expression which was once
     universal.  It was formerly the custom for both sexes to sleep in
     bed without any nightlinen.

              "Who sees his true love in her naked bed,
               Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white."

                              Shakespeare, Venus and Adonis.

     Nares ("Glossary") notes the expression so late as in the very odd
     novel by T. Amory, called "John Bunde," where a young lady declares,
     after an alarm, "that she would never go into naked bed on board
     ship again."  Octavo edition, vol. i.  p. 90.]

and slept till 9 o'clock, and then John Goods waked me, [by] and by the
captain's boy brought me four barrels of Mallows oysters, which Captain
Tatnell had sent me from Murlace.--[Apparently Mallows stands for St.
Malo and Murlace for Morlaise.]--The weather foul all this day also.
After dinner, about writing one thing or other all day, and setting my
papers in order, having been so long absent. At night Mr. Pierce, Purser
(the other Pierce and I having not spoken to one another since we fell
out about Mr. Edward), and Mr. Cook sat with me in my cabin and supped
with me, and then I went to bed. By letters that came hither in my
absence, I understand that the Parliament had ordered all persons to be
secured, in order to a trial, that did sit as judges in the late King's
death, and all the officers too attending the Court. Sir John Lenthall
moving in the House, that all that had borne arms against the King
should be exempted from pardon, he was called to the bar of the House,
and after a severe reproof he was degraded his knighthood. At Court I
find that all things grow high. The old clergy talk as being sure of
their lands again, and laugh at the Presbytery; and it is believed that
the sales of the King's and Bishops' lands will never be confirmed by
Parliament, there being nothing now in any man's, power to hinder them
and the King from doing what they have a mind, but every body willing
to submit to any thing. We expect every day to have the King and Duke
on board as soon as it is fair. My Lord do nothing now, but offers all
things to the pleasure of the Duke as Lord High Admiral. So that I am at
a loss what to do.

22nd. Up very early, and now beginning to be settled in my wits again,
I went about setting down my last four days' observations this morning.
After that, was trimmed by a barber that has not trimmed me yet, my
Spaniard being on shore. News brought that the two Dukes are coming on
board, which, by and by, they did, in a Dutch boats the Duke of York in
yellow trimmings, the Duke of Gloucester

     [Henry, Duke of Gloucester, the youngest child of Charles L, born
     July 6th, 16--, who, with his sister Elizabeth, was allowed a
     meeting with his father on the night before the King's execution.
     Burnet says: "He was active, and loved business; was apt to have
     particular friendships, and had an insinuating temper which was
     generally very acceptable.  The King loved him much better than the
     Duke of York."  He died of smallpox at Whitehall, September 13th,
     1660, and was buried in Henry VII's Chapel.]

in grey and red. My Lord went in a boat to meet them, the Captain,
myself, and others, standing at the entering port. So soon as they were
entered we shot the guns off round the fleet. After that they went to
view the ship all over, and were most exceedingly pleased with it.
They seem to be both very fine gentlemen. After that done, upon the
quarter-deck table, under the awning, the Duke of York and my Lord, Mr.
Coventry,

     [William Coventry, to whom Pepys became so warmly attached
     afterwards, was the fourth son of Thomas, first Lord Coventry, the
     Lord Keeper.  He was born in 1628, and entered at Queen's College,
     Oxford, in 1642; after the Restoration he became private secretary
     to the Duke of York, his commission as Secretary to the Lord High
     Admiral not being conferred until 1664; elected M.P. for Great
     Yarmouth in 1661.  In 1662 he was appointed an extra Commissioner of
     the Navy, an office he held until 1667; in 1665, knighted and sworn
     a Privy Councillor, and, in 1667, constituted a Commissioner of the
     Treasury; but, having been forbid the court on account of his
     challenging the Duke of Buckingham, he retired into the country, nor
     could he subsequently be prevailed upon to accept of any official
     employment.  Burnet calls Sir William Coventry the best speaker in
     the House of Commons, and "a man of the finest and best temper that
     belonged to the court," and Pepys never omits an opportunity of
     paying a tribute to his public and private worth.  He died, 1686, of
     gout in the stomach.]

and I, spent an hour at allotting to every ship their service, in their
return to England; which having done, they went to dinner, where the
table was very full: the two Dukes at the upper end, my Lord Opdam next
on one side, and my Lord on the other. Two guns given to every man while
he was drinking the King's health, and so likewise to the Duke's health.
I took down Monsieur d'Esquier to the great cabin below, and dined with
him in state alone with only one or two friends of his. All dinner the
harper belonging to Captain Sparling played to the Dukes. After dinner,
the Dukes and my Lord to see the Vice and Rear-Admirals; and I in a boat
after them. After that done, they made to the shore in the Dutch boat
that brought them, and I got into the boat with them; but the shore was
so full of people to expect their coming, as that it was as black (which
otherwise is white sand), as every one could stand by another. When we
came near the shore, my Lord left them and came into his own boat, and
General Pen and I with him; my Lord being very well pleased with this
day's work. By the time we came on board again, news is sent us that the
King is on shore; so my Lord fired all his guns round twice, and all the
fleet after him, which in the end fell into disorder, which seemed very
handsome. The gun over against my cabin I fired myself to the King,
which was the first time that he had been saluted by his own ships since
this change; but holding my head too much over the gun, I had almost
spoiled my right eye. Nothing in the world but going of guns almost all
this day. In the evening we began to remove cabins; I to the carpenter's
cabin, and Dr. Clerke with me, who came on board this afternoon, having
been twice ducked in the sea to-day coming from shore, and Mr. North
and John Pickering the like. Many of the King's servants came on board
to-night; and so many Dutch of all sorts came to see the ship till it
was quite dark, that we could not pass by one another, which was a
great trouble to us all. This afternoon Mr. Downing (who was knighted
yesterday by the King') was here on board, and had a ship for his
passage into England, with his lady and servants.

     ["About midnight arrived there Mr. Downing, who did the affairs of
     England to the Lords the Estates, in quality of Resident under
     Oliver Cromwell, and afterward under the pretended Parliament, which
     having changed the form of the government, after having cast forth
     the last Protector, had continued him in his imploiment, under the
     quality of Extraordinary Envoy.  He began to have respect for the
     King's person, when he knew that all England declared for a free
     parliament, and departed from Holland without order, as soon as he
     understood that there was nothing that could longer oppose the re-
     establishment of monarchal government, with a design to crave
     letters of recommendation to General Monk.  This lord considered
     him, as well because of the birth of his wife, which is illustrious,
     as because Downing had expressed some respect for him in a time when
     that eminent person could not yet discover his intentions.  He had
     his letters when he arrived at midnight at the house of the Spanish
     Embassador, as we have said.  He presented them forthwith to the
     King, who arose from table a while after, read the letters, receiv'd
     the submissions of Downing, and granted him the pardon and grace
     which he asked for him to whom he could deny nothing.  Some daies
     after the King knighted him, and would it should be believed, that
     the strong aversions which this minister of the Protector had made
     appear against him on all occasions, and with all sorts of persons
     indifferently, even a few daies before the publick and general
     declaration of all England, proceeded not from any evil intention,
     but only from a deep dissimulation, wherewith he was constrained to
     cover his true sentiments, for fear to prejudice the affairs of his
     Majesty."--Sir William Lowers Relation... of the Voiage and
     Residence which...  Charles the II.  hath made in Holland,
     Hague, 1660, folio, pp. 72-73.]

By the same token he called me to him when I was going to write the
order, to tell me that I must write him Sir G. Downing. My Lord lay in
the roundhouse to-night. This evening I was late writing a French letter
myself by my Lord's order to Monsieur Kragh, Embassador de Denmarke a la
Haye, which my Lord signed in bed. After that I to bed, and the Doctor,
and sleep well.

23rd. The Doctor and I waked very merry, only my eye was very red and
ill in the morning from yesterday's hurt. In the morning came infinity
of people on board from the King to go along with him. My Lord, Mr.
Crew, and others, go on shore to meet the King as he comes off from
shore, where Sir R. Stayner bringing His Majesty into the boat, I hear
that His Majesty did with a great deal of affection kiss my Lord upon
his first meeting. The King, with the two Dukes and Queen of Bohemia,
Princess Royal, and Prince of Orange, came on board, where I in their
coming in kissed the King's, Queen's, and Princess's hands, having
done the other before. Infinite shooting off of the guns, and that in a
disorder on purpose, which was better than if it had been otherwise.
All day nothing but Lords and persons of honour on board, that we were
exceeding full. Dined in a great deal of state, the Royall company by
themselves in the coach, which was a blessed sight to see. I dined with
Dr. Clerke, Dr. Quarterman, and Mr. Darcy in my cabin. This morning
Mr. Lucy came on board, to whom and his company of the King's Guard in
another ship my Lord did give three dozen of bottles of wine. He made
friends between Mr. Pierce and me. After dinner the King and Duke
altered the name of some of the ships, viz. the Nazeby into Charles; the
Richard, James; the Speakers Mary; the Dunbar (which was not in company
with us), the Henry; Winsly, Happy Return; Wakefield, Richmond; Lambert;
the Henrietta; Cheriton, the Speedwell; Bradford, the Success. That
done, the Queen, Princess Royal, and Prince of Orange, took leave of
the King, and the Duke of York went on board the London, and the Duke
of Gloucester, the Swiftsure. Which done, we weighed anchor, and with
a fresh gale and most happy weather we set sail for England. All the
afternoon the King walked here and there, up and down (quite contrary
to what I thought him to have been), very active and stirring. Upon the
quarterdeck he fell into discourse of his escape from Worcester,

     [For the King's own account of his escape dictated to Pepys, see
     "Boscobel" (Bohn's "Standard Library").]

where it made me ready to weep to hear the stories that he told of his
difficulties that he had passed through, as his travelling four days and
three nights on foot, every step up to his knees in dirt, with nothing
but a green coat and a pair of country breeches on, and a pair of
country shoes that made him so sore all over his feet, that he could
scarce stir. Yet he was forced to run away from a miller and other
company, that took them for rogues. His sitting at table at one place,
where the master of the house, that had not seen him in eight years, did
know him, but kept it private; when at the same table there was one that
had been of his own regiment at Worcester, could not know him, but made
him drink the King's health, and said that the King was at least four
fingers higher than he. At another place he was by some servants of the
house made to drink, that they might know him not to be a Roundhead,
which they swore he was. In another place at his inn, the master of the
house,

     [This was at Brighton.  The inn was the "George," and the innkeeper
     was named Smith.  Charles related this circumstance again to Pepys
     in October, 1680.  He then said, "And here also I ran into another
     very great danger, as being confident I was known by the master of
     the inn; for, as I was standing after supper by the fireside,
     leaning my hand upon a chair, and all the rest of the company being
     gone into another room, the master of the inn came in and fell a-
     talking with me, and just as he was looking about, and saw there was
     nobody in the room, he upon a sudden kissed my hand that was upon
     the back of the chair, and said to me, 'God bless you wheresoever
     you go!  I do not doubt before I die, but to be a lord, and my wife
     a lady.' So I laughed, and went away into the next room."]

as the King was standing with his hands upon the back of a chair by the
fire-side, kneeled down and kissed his hand, privately, saying, that
he would not ask him who he was, but bid God bless him whither he was
going. Then the difficulty of getting a boat to get into France, where
he was fain to plot with the master thereof to keep his design from the
four men and a boy (which was all his ship's company), and so got to
Fecamp in France.

     [On Saturday, October 11th, 1651, Colonel Gunter made an agreement
     at Chichester with Nicholas Tettersell, through Francis Mansell (a
     French merchant), to have Tettersell's vessel ready at an hour's
     warning.  Charles II., in his narrative dictated to Pepys in 1680,
     said, "We went to a place, four miles off Shoreham, called
     Brighthelmstone, where we were to meet with the master of the ship,
     as thinking it more convenient to meet there than just at Shoreham,
     where the ship was.  So when we came to the inn at Brighthelmstone
     we met with one, the merchant Francis Mansell] who had hired the
     vessel, in company with her master [Tettersell], the merchant only
     knowing me, as having hired her only to carry over a person of
     quality that was escaped from the battle of Worcester without naming
     anybody."

     The boat was supposed to be bound for Poole, but Charles says in his
     narrative: "As we were sailing the master came to me, and desired me
     that I would persuade his men to use their best endeavours with him
     to get him to set us on shore in France, the better to cover him
     from any suspicion thereof, upon which I went to the men, which were
     four and a boy."

     After the Restoration Mansell was granted a pension of L200 a year,
     and Tettersell one of L100 a year.  (See "Captain Nicholas
     Tettersell and the Escape of Charles II.," by F. E. Sawyer, F.S.A.,
     "Sussex Archaeological Collections," vol. xxxii.  pp. 81-104).)

At Rouen he looked so poorly, that the people went into the rooms before
he went away to see whether he had not stole something or other. In the
evening I went up to my Lord to write letters for England, which we sent
away with word of our coming, by Mr. Edw. Pickering. The King supped
alone in the coach; after that I got a dish, and we four supped in my
cabin, as at noon. About bed-time my Lord Bartlett

     [A mistake for Lord Berkeley of Berkeley, who had been deputed, with
     Lord Middlesex and four other Peers, by the House of Lords to
     present an address of congratulation to the King.--B.]

(who I had offered my service to before) sent for me to get him a bed,
who with much ado I did get to bed to my Lord Middlesex in the great
cabin below, but I was cruelly troubled before I could dispose of him,
and quit myself of him. So to my cabin again, where the company still
was, and were talking more of the King's difficulties; as how he was
fain to eat a piece of bread and cheese out of a poor boy's pocket; how,
at a Catholique house, he was fain to lie in the priest's hole a good
while in the house for his privacy. After that our company broke up, and
the Doctor and I to bed. We have all the Lords Commissioners on board
us, and many others. Under sail all night, and most glorious weather.

24th. Up, and made myself as fine as I could, with the Tinning stockings
on and wide canons--["Cannions, boot hose tops; an old-fashioned
ornament for the legs." That is to say, a particular addition to
breeches.]--that I bought the other day at Hague. Extraordinary press
of noble company, and great mirth all the day. There dined with me in my
cabin (that is, the carpenter's) Dr. Earle

     [John Earle, born about 1601; appointed in 1643 one of the
     Westminster Assembly of Divines, but his principles did not allow
     him to act.  He accompanied Charles II. when he was obliged to fly
     from England.  Dean of Westminster at the Restoration, Bishop of
     Worcester, November 30th, 1662, and translated to Salisbury,
     September 28th, 1663.  He was tender to the Nonconformists, and
     Baxter wrote of him, "O that they were all such!"  Author of
     "Microcosmography."  Died November 17th, 1665, and was buried in the
     chapel of Merton College, of which he had been a Fellow.  Charles
     II.  had the highest esteem for him.]

and Mr. Hollis,

     [Denzil Holles, second son of John, first Earl of Clare, born at
     Houghton, Notts, in 1597.  He was one of the five members charged
     with high treason by Charles I. in 1641.  He was a Presbyterian, and
     one of the Commissioners sent by Parliament to wait on Charles II.
     at the Hague.  Sir William Lower, in his "Relation," 1660, writes:
     "All agreed that never person spake with more affection nor
     expressed himself in better terms than Mr. Denzil Hollis, who was
     orator for the Deputies of the Lower House, to whom those of London
     were joined."  He was created Baron Holles on April 20th, 1661, on
     the occasion of the coronation of Charles II.]

the King's Chaplins, Dr. Scarborough,

     [Charles Scarburgh, M.D., an eminent physician who suffered for the
     royal cause during the Civil Wars.  He was born in London, and
     educated at St. Paul's School and Caius College, Cambridge.  He was
     ejected from his fellowship at Caius, and withdrew to Oxford.  He
     entered himself at Merton College, then presided over by Harvey,
     with whom he formed a lifelong friendship.  He was knighted by
     Charles II. in 1669, and attended the King in his last illness.  He
     was also physician to James II. and to William III., and died
     February 26th, 1693-4.]

Dr. Quarterman, and Dr. Clerke, Physicians, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Fox

     [Stephen Fox, born 1627, and said to have been a choir-boy in
     Salisbury Cathedral.  He was the first person to announce the death
     of Cromwell to Charles II., and at the Restoration he was made Clerk
     of the Green Cloth, and afterwards Paymaster of the Forces.  He was
     knighted in 1665.  He married Elizabeth, daughter of William Whittle
     of Lancashire.  (See June 25th, 1660.) Fox died in 1716.  His sons
     Stephen and Henry were created respectively Earl of Ilchester and
     Lord Holland.]

(both very fine gentlemen), the King's servants, where we had brave
discourse. Walking upon the decks, where persons of honour all the
afternoon, among others, Thomas Killigrew (a merry droll, but a
gentleman of great esteem with the King), who told us many merry
stories: one, how he wrote a letter three or four days ago to the
Princess Royal, about a Queen Dowager of Judaea and Palestine, that was
at the Hague incognita, that made love to the King, &c., which was Mr.
Cary (a courtier's) wife that had been a nun, who are all married to
Jesus. At supper the three Drs. of Physic again at my cabin; where I
put Dr. Scarborough in mind of what I heard him say about the use of the
eyes, which he owned, that children do, in every day's experience, look
several ways with both their eyes, till custom teaches them otherwise.
And that we do now see but with one eye, our eyes looking in parallel
lines. After this discourse I was called to write a pass for my Lord
Mandeville to take up horses to London, which I wrote in the King's
name,--[This right of purveyance was abolished in Charles's reign.]--and
carried it to him to sign, which was the first and only one that ever
he signed in the ship Charles. To bed, coming in sight of land a little
before night.

25th. By the morning we were come close to the land, and every body
made ready to get on shore. The King and the two Dukes did eat their
breakfast before they went, and there being set some ship's diet before
them, only to show them the manner of the ship's diet, they eat of
nothing else but pease and pork, and boiled beef. I had Mr. Darcy in my
cabin and Dr. Clerke, who eat with me, told me how the King had given
L50 to Mr. Sheply for my Lord's servants, and L500 among the officers
and common men of the ship. I spoke with the Duke of York about
business, who called me Pepys by name, and upon my desire did promise me
his future favour. Great expectation of the King's making some Knights,
but there was none. About noon (though the brigantine that Beale made
was there ready to carry him) yet he would go in my Lord's barge with
the two Dukes. Our Captain steered, and my Lord went along bare with
him. I went, and Mr. Mansell, and one of the King's footmen, with a dog
that the King loved,

     [Charles II.'s love of dogs is well known, but it is not so well
     known that his dogs were continually being stolen from him.  In the
     "Mercurius Publicus," June 28-July 5, 1660, is the following
     advertisement, apparently drawn up by the King himself: "We must
     call upon you again for a Black Dog between a greyhound and a
     spaniel, no white about him, onely a streak on his brest, and his
     tayl a little bobbed.  It is His Majesties own Dog, and doubtless
     was stoln, for the dog was not born nor bred in England, and would
     never forsake His master.  Whoesoever findes him may acquaint any at
     Whitehal for the Dog was better known at Court, than those who stole
     him.  Will they never leave robbing his Majesty!  Must he not keep a
     Dog?  This dog's place (though better than some imagine) is the only
     place which nobody offers to beg."  (Quoted in "Notes and Queries,"
     7th S., vii. 26, where are printed two other advertisements of
     Charles's lost dogs.)]

(which [dirted] the boat, which made us laugh, and me think that a King
and all that belong to him are but just as others are), in a boat by
ourselves, and so got on shore when the King did, who was received by
General Monk with all imaginable love and respect at his entrance
upon the land of Dover. Infinite the crowd of people and the horsemen,
citizens, and noblemen of all sorts. The Mayor of the town came and gave
him his white staff, the badge of his place, which the King did give
him again. The Mayor also presented him from the town a very rich Bible,
which he took and said it was the thing that he loved above all things
in the world. A canopy was provided for him to stand under, which he
did, and talked awhile with General Monk and others, and so into a
stately coach there set for him, and so away through the town towards
Canterbury, without making any stay at Dover. The shouting and joy
expressed by all is past imagination. Seeing that my Lord did not stir
out of his barge, I got into a boat, and so into his barge, whither Mr.
John Crew stepped, and spoke a word or two to my Lord, and so returned,
we back to the ship, and going did see a man almost drowned that fell
out of his boat into the sea, but with much ado was got out. My Lord
almost transported with joy that he had done all this without any the
least blur or obstruction in the world, that could give an offence to
any, and with the great honour he thought it would be to him. Being
overtook by the brigantine, my Lord and we went out of our barge into
it, and so went on board with Sir W. Batten,

     [Clarendon describes William Batten as an obscure fellow, and,
     although unknown to the service, a good seaman, who was in 1642 made
     Surveyor to the Navy; in which employ he evinced great animosity
     against the King.  The following year, while Vice-Admiral to the
     Earl of Warwick, he chased a Dutch man-of-war into Burlington Bay,
     knowing that Queen Henrietta Maria was on board; and then, learning
     that she had landed and was lodged on the quay, he fired above a
     hundred shot upon the house, some of which passing through her
     majesty's chamber, she was obliged, though indisposed, to retire for
     safety into the open fields.  This act, brutal as it was, found
     favour with the Parliament.  But Batten became afterwards
     discontented; and, when a portion of the fleet revolted, he carried
     the "Constant Warwick," one of the best ships in the Parliament
     navy, over into Holland, with several seamen of note.  For this act
     of treachery he was knighted and made a Rear-Admiral by Prince
     Charles.  We hear no more of Batten till the Restoration, when he
     became a Commissioner of the Navy, and was soon after M.P. for
     Rochester.  See an account of his second wife, in note to November
     24th, 1660, and of his illness and death, October 5th, 1667.  He had
     a son, Benjamin, and a daughter, Martha, by his first wife.--B.]

and the Vice and Rear-Admirals. At night my Lord supped and Mr. Thomas
Crew with Captain Stoakes, I supped with the Captain, who told me what
the King had given us. My Lord returned late, and at his coming did give
me order to cause the marke to be gilded, and a Crown and C. R. to be
made at the head of the coach table, where the King to-day with his own
hand did mark his height, which accordingly I caused the painter to do,
and is now done as is to be seen.

26th. Thanks to God I got to bed in my own poor cabin, and slept well
till 9 o'clock this morning. Mr. North and Dr. Clerke and all the great
company being gone, I found myself very uncouth all this day for
want thereof. My Lord dined with the Vice-Admiral to-day (who is as
officious, poor man! as any spaniel can be; but I believe all to no
purpose, for I believe he will not hold his place), so I dined commander
at the coach table to-day, and all the officers of the ship with me, and
Mr. White of Dover. After a game or two at nine-pins, to work all the
afternoon, making above twenty orders. In the evening my Lord having
been a-shore, the first time that he hath been a-shore since he came out
of the Hope (having resolved not to go till he had brought his Majesty
into England), returned on board with a great deal of pleasure. I
supped with the Captain in his cabin with young Captain Cuttance, and
afterwards a messenger from the King came with a letter, and to go into
France, and by that means we supped again with him at 12 o'clock at
night. This night the Captain told me that my Lord had appointed me L30
out of the 1000 ducats which the King had given to the ship, at which my
heart was very much joyed. To bed.

27th (Lord's day). Called up by John Goods to see the Garter and Heralds
coat, which lay in the coach, brought by Sir Edward Walker,

     [Edward Walker was knighted February 2nd, 1644-5, and on the 24th of
     the same month was sworn in as Garter King at Arms.  He adhered to
     the cause of the king, and published "Iter Carolinum", being a
     succinct account of the necessitated marches, retreats, and
     sufferings of his Majesty King Charles I., from Jan. 10, 1641, to
     the time of his death in 1648, collected by a daily attendant upon
     his sacred Majesty during all that time: He joined Charles II. in
     exile, and received the reward of his loyalty at the Restoration.
     He died at Whitehall, February 19th, 1676-7, and was buried at
     Stratford-on-Avon, his daughter having married Sir John Clepton of
     that place.]

King at Arms, this morning, for my Lord. My Lord hath summoned all the
Commanders on board him, to see the ceremony, which was thus: Sir Edward
putting on his coat, and having laid the George and Garter, and the
King's letter to my Lord, upon a crimson cushion (in the coach, all the
Commanders standing by), makes three congees to him, holding the cushion
in his arms. Then laying it down with the things upon it upon a chair,
he takes the letter, and delivers it to my Lord, which my Lord breaks
open and gives him to read. It was directed to our trusty and well
beloved Sir Edward Montagu, Knight, one of our Generals at sea, and our
Companion elect of our Noble Order of the Garter. The contents of the
letter is to show that the Kings of England have for many years made
use of this honour, as a special mark of favour, to persons of good
extraction and virtue (and that many Emperors, Kings and Princes of
other countries have borne this honour), and that whereas my Lord is of
a noble family, and hath now done the King such service by sea, at this
time, as he hath done; he do send him this George and Garter to wear as
Knight of the Order, with a dispensation for the other ceremonies of
the habit of the Order, and other things, till hereafter, when it can
be done. So the herald putting the ribbon about his neck, and the Garter
about his left leg, he salutes him with joy as Knight of the Garter, and
that was all. After that was done, and the Captain and I had breakfasted
with Sir Edward while my Lord was writing of a letter, he took his leave
of my Lord, and so to shore again to the King at Canterbury, where he
yesterday gave the like honour to General Monk,

     ["His Majesty put the George on his Excellency, and the two Dukes
     put on the Garter.  The Princes thus honoured the Lord-General for
     the restoration of that lawful family."--Rugge's Diurnal.]

who are the only two for many years that have had the Garter given them,
before they had other honours of Earldom, or the like, excepting only
the Duke of Buckingham, who was only Sir George Villiers when he was
made Knight of the Garter. A while after Mr. Thos. Crew and Mr. J.
Pickering (who had staid long enough to make all the world see him to be
a fool), took ship for London. So there now remain no strangers with
my Lord but Mr. Hetley, who had been with us a day before the King went
from us. My Lord and the ship's company down to sermon. I staid above to
write and look over my new song book, which came last night to me from
London in lieu of that that my Lord had of me. The officers being all
on board, there was not room for me at table, so I dined in my cabin,
where, among other things, Mr. Drum brought me a lobster and a bottle of
oil, instead of a bottle of vinegar, whereby I spoiled my dinner. Many
orders in the ordering of ships this afternoon. Late to a sermon. After
that up to the Lieutenant's cabin, where Mr. Sheply, I, and the Minister
supped, and after that I went down to W. Howe's cabin, and there, with a
great deal of pleasure, singing till it was late. After that to bed.

28th. Called up at two in the morning for letters for my Lord from
the Duke of York, but I went to bed again till 5. Trimmed early this
morning. This morning the Captain did call over all the men in the ship
(not the boys), and give every one of them a ducat of the King's money
that he gave the ship, and the officers according to their quality. I
received in the Captain's cabin, for my share, sixty ducats. The rest of
the morning busy writing letters. So was my Lord that he would not come
to dinner. After dinner to write again in order to sending to London,
but my Lord did not finish his, so we did not send to London to-day. A
great part of the afternoon at nine-pins with my Lord and Mr. Hetley.
I lost about 4s. Supped with my Lord, and after that to bed. At night I
had a strange dream of--myself, which I really did, and having kicked my
clothes off, I got cold; and found myself all much wet in the morning,
and had a great deal of pain... which made me very melancholy.

29th. The King's birthday. Busy all the morning writing letters to
London, among the rest one to Mr. Chetwind to give me an account of
the fees due to the Herald for the Order of the Garter, which my Lord
desires to know. After dinner got all ready and sent away Mr. Cook to
London with a letter and token to my wife. After that abroad to shore
with my Lord (which he offered me of himself, saying that I had a great
deal of work to do this month, which was very true). On shore we took
horses, my Lord and Mr. Edward, Mr. Hetly and I, and three or four
servants, and had a great deal of pleasure in riding. Among other things
my Lord showed me a house that cost a great deal of money, and is built
in so barren and inconvenient a place that my Lord calls it the fool's
house. At last we came upon a very high cliff by the sea-side, and rode
under it, we having laid great wagers, I and Dr. Mathews, that it was
not so high as Paul's; my Lord and Mr. Hetly, that it was. But we riding
under it, my Lord made a pretty good measure of it with two sticks, and
found it to be not above thirty-five yards high, and Paul's is reckoned
to be about ninety. From thence toward the barge again, and in our way
found the people at Deal going to make a bonfire for joy of the day, it
being the King's birthday, and had some guns which they did fire at my
Lord's coming by. For which I did give twenty shillings among them to
drink. While we were on the top of the cliffe, we saw and heard our guns
in the fleet go off for the same joy. And it being a pretty fair day we
could see above twenty miles into France. Being returned on board, my
Lord called for Mr. Sheply's book of Paul's, by which we were confirmed
in our wager. After that to supper and then to musique, and so to
bed. The pain that I have got last night by cold is not yet gone, but
troubles me at the time of.... This day, it is thought, the King do
enter the city of London.

     ["Divers maidens, in behalf of themselves and others, presented a
     petition to the Lord Mayor of London, wherein they pray his Lordship
     to grant them leave and liberty to meet His Majesty on the day of
     his passing through the city; and if their petition be granted, that
     they will all be clad in white waistcoats and crimson petticoats,
     and other ornaments of triumph and rejoicing."-Rugge's Diurnal, May,
     1660.--B.]

30th. About eight o'clock in the morning the lieutenant came to me
to know whether I would eat a dish of mackerel, newly catched, for my
breakfast, which the Captain and we did in the coach. All yesterday
and to-day I had a great deal of pain... and in my back, which made me
afeard. But it proved nothing but cold, which I took yesterday night.
All this morning making up my accounts, in which I counted that I had
made myself now worth about L80, at which my heart was glad, and blessed
God. Many Dover men come and dine with my Lord. My Lord at ninepins in
the afternoon. In the afternoon Mr. Sheply told me how my Lord had put
me down for 70 guilders among the money which was given to my Lord's
servants, which my heart did much rejoice at. My Lord supped alone in
his chamber. Sir R. Stayner supped with us, and among other things told
us how some of his men did grumble that no more of the Duke's money
come to their share and so would not receive any; whereupon he called up
those that had taken it, and gives them three shares apiece more, which
was very good, and made good sport among the seamen. To bed.

31st. This day my Lord took physic, and came not out of his chamber.

All the morning making orders. After dinner a great while below in the
great cabin trying with W. Howe some of Mr. Laws' songs,' particularly
that of "What is a kiss," with which we had a great deal of pleasure.
After that to making of orders again. Captain Sparling of the Assistance
brought me a pair of silk stockings of a light blue, which I was
much pleased with. The Captain and I to supper, and after that a most
pleasant walk till to at night with him upon the deck, it being a fine
evening. My pain was gone again that I had yesterday, blessed be God.
This day the month ends, I in very good health, and all the world in a
merry mood because of the King's coming. This day I began to teach Mr.
Edward; who I find to have a very good foundation laid for his Latin by
Mr. Fuller. I expect every minute to hear how my poor wife do. I find
myself in all things well as to body and mind, but troubled for the
absence of my wife.




JUNE 1660

June 1st. This morning Mr. Sheply disposed of the money that the Duke
of York did give my Lord's servants, 22 ducatoons 3 came to my share,
whereof he told me to give Jaspar something because my Lord left him
out.

     [Foreign coins were in frequent use at this time.  A Proclamation,
     January 29th, 1660-61, declared certain foreign gold and silver
     coins to be current at certain rates.  The rate of the ducatoon was
     at 5s. 9d.]

I did give Mr. Sheply the fine pair of buckskin gloves that I bought
myself about five years ago. My Lord took physic to-day, and so come not
out all day. The Captain on shore all day. After dinner Captain Jefferys
and W. Howe, and the Lieutenant and I to ninepins, where I lost about
two shillings and so fooled away all the afternoon. At night Mr. Cooke
comes from London with letters, leaving all things there very gallant
and joyful. And brought us word that the Parliament had ordered the
29th of May, the King's birthday, to be for ever kept as a day of
thanksgiving for our redemption from tyranny, and the King's return to
his Government, he entering London that day. My wife was in London when
he came thither, and had been there a week with Mr. Bowyer and his wife.
My poor wife has not been well a week before, but thanks be to God is
well again. She would fain see me and be at her house again, but we
must be content. She writes word how the Joyces grow very rich and very
proud, but it is no matter, and that there was a talk that I should
be knighted by the King, which they (the Joyces) laugh at; but I think
myself happier in my wife and estate than they are in theirs. To bed.
The Captain come on board, when I was going to bed, quite fuddled;
and himself the next morning told me so too, that the Vice-Admiral,
Rear-Admiral, and he had been drinking all day.

2d. Being with my Lord in the morning about business in his cabin, I
took occasion to give him thanks for his love to me in the share that
he had given me of his Majesty's money, and the Duke's. He told the he
hoped to do me a more lasting kindness, if all things stand as they
are now between him and the King, but, says he, "We must have a little
patience and we will rise together; in the mean time I will do you all
the good jobs I can." Which was great content for me to hear from my
Lord. All the morning with the Captain, computing how much the thirty
ships that come with the King from Scheveling their pay comes to for a
month (because the King promised to give them all a month's pay), and
it comes to L6,538, and the Charles particularly L777. I wish we had
the money. All the afternoon with two or three captains in the Captain's
cabin, drinking of white wine and sugar, and eating pickled oysters,
where Captain Sparling told us the best story that ever I heard, about
a gentleman that persuaded a country fool to let him gut his oysters or
else they would stink. At night writing letters to London and Weymouth,
for my Lord being now to sit in the House of Peers he endeavours to get
Mr. Edward Montagu for Weymouth and Mr. George for Dover. Mr. Cooke late
with me in my cabin while I wrote to my wife, and drank a bottle of wine
and so took leave of me on his journey and I to bed.

3d. Waked in the morning by one who when I asked who it was, he told me
one from Bridewell, which proved Captain Holland. I rose presently to
him. He is come to get an order for the setting out of his ship, and to
renew his commission. He tells me how every man goes to the Lord Mayor
to set down their names, as such as do accept of his Majesty's pardon,
and showed me a certificate under the Lord Mayor's hand that he had done
so.

At sermon in the morning; after dinner into my cabin, to cast my
accounts up, and find myself to be worth near L100, for which I bless
Almighty God, it being more than I hoped for so soon, being I believe
not clearly worth L25 when I came to sea besides my house and goods.
Then to set my papers in order, they being increased much upon my hands
through want of time to put them in order. The ship's company all this
while at sermon. After sermon my Lord did give me instruction to write
to London about business, which done, after supper to bed.

4th. Waked in the morning at four o'clock to give some money to Mr.
Hetly, who was to go to London with the letters that I wrote yesterday
night. After he was gone I went and lay down in my gown upon my bed
again an hour or two. At last waked by a messenger come for a Post
Warrant for Mr. Hetly and Mr. Creed, who stood to give so little for
their horses that the men would not let them have any without a warrant,
which I sent them. All the morning getting Captain Holland's commission
done, which I did, and he at noon went away. I took my leave of him upon
the quarter-deck with a bottle of sack, my Lord being just set down to
dinner. Then he being gone I went to dinner and after dinner to my cabin
to write. This afternoon I showed my Lord my accounts, which he passed,
and so I think myself to be worth near L100 now. In the evening I made
an order for Captain Sparling of the Assistance to go to Middleburgh, to
fetch over some of the King's goods. I took the opportunity to send all
my Dutch money, 70 ducatoons and 29 gold ducats to be changed, if he
can, for English money, which is the first venture that ever I made, and
so I have been since a little afeard of it. After supper some music
and so to bed. This morning the King's Proclamation against drinking,
swearing, and debauchery, was read to our ships' companies in the fleet,
and indeed it gives great satisfaction to all.

     [The King's "Proclamation against vicious, debauched, and prophane
     Persons" is dated May 30th.  It is printed in "Somers's Tracts," ed.
     1812, vol. vii.  p. 423.]

5th. A-bed late. In the morning my Lord went on shore with the
Vice-Admiral a-fishing, and at dinner returned. In the afternoon I
played at ninepins with my Lord, and when he went in again I got him to
sign my accounts for L115, and so upon my private balance I find myself
confirmed in my estimation that I am worth L100. In the evening in my
cabin a great while getting the song without book, "Help, help Divinity,
&c." After supper my Lord called for the lieutenant's cittern, and
with two candlesticks with money in them for symballs, we made barber's
music,

     [In the "Notices of Popular Histories," printed for the Percy
     Society, there is a curious woodcut representing the interior of a
     barber's shop, in which, according to the old custom, the person
     waiting to be shaved is playing on the "ghittern" till his turn
     arrives.  Decker also mentions a "barber's cittern," for every
     serving-man to play upon.  This is no doubt "the barber's music"
     with which Lord Sandwich entertained himself.--B.]

with which my Lord was well pleased. So to bed.

6th. In the morning I had letters come, that told me among other things,
that my Lord's place of Clerk of the Signet was fallen to him, which he
did most lovingly tell me that I should execute, in case he could
not get a better employment for me at the end of the year. Because he
thought that the Duke of York would command all, but he hoped that the
Duke would not remove me but to my advantage.

I had a great deal of talk about my uncle Robert,

     [Robert Pepys of Brampton, eldest son of Thomas Pepys the red, and
     brother of Samuel's father.]

and he told me that he could not tell how his mind stood as to his
estate, but he would do all that lay in his power for me. After dinner
came Mr. Gooke from London, who told me that my wife he left well at
Huntsmore, though her health not altogether so constant as it used to
be, which my heart is troubled for. Mr. Moore's letters tell me that
he thinks my Lord will be suddenly sent for up to London, and so I got
myself in readiness to go.

My letters tell me, that Mr. Calamy

     [Edmund Calamy, D.D., the celebrated Nonconformist divine, born
     February, 1600, appointed Chaplain to Charles II., 1660.  He refused
     the bishopric of Lichfield which was offered to him.  Died October
     29th, 1666.]

had preached before the King in a surplice (this I heard afterwards
to be false); that my Lord, Gen. Monk, and three more Lords, are made
Commissioners for the Treasury;

     [The names of the Commissioners were--Sir Edward Hyde, afterwards
     Earl of Clarendon, General Monk, Thomas, Earl of Southampton, John,
     Lord Robartes, Thomas, Lord Colepeper, Sir Edward Montagu, with Sir
     Edward Nicholas and Sir William Morrice as principal Secretaries of
     State.  The patents are dated June 19th, 1660.]

that my Lord had some great place conferred on him, and they say Master
of the Wardrobe;

     [The duty of the Master of the Wardrobe was to provide "proper
     furniture for coronations, marriages, and funerals" of the sovereign
     and royal family, "cloaths of state, beds, hangings, and other
     necessaries for the houses of foreign ambassadors, cloaths of state
     for Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Prince of Wales, and ambassadors
     abroad," as also to provide robes for Ministers of State, Knights of
     the Garter, &c.  The last Master of the Wardrobe was Ralph, Duke of
     Montague, who died 1709.]

that the two Dukes--[Duke of York and Duke of Gloucester.]--do haunt the
Park much, and that they were at a play, Madam Epicene,--["Epicene, or
the Silent Woman," a comedy, by Ben Jonson.]--the other day; that Sir.
Ant. Cooper, Mr. Hollis, and Mr. Annesly,& late President of the Council
of State, are made Privy Councillors to the King. At night very busy
sending Mr. Donne away to London, and wrote to my father for a coat to
be made me against I come to London, which I think will not be long. At
night Mr. Edward Montagu came on board and staid long up with my Lord. I
to bed and about one in the morning,

7th. W. Howe called me up to give him a letter to carry to my Lord that
came to me to-day, which I did and so to, sleep again. About three
in the morning the people began to wash the deck, and the water came
pouring into my mouth, which waked me, and I was fain to rise and get
on my gown, and sleep leaning on my table. This morning Mr. Montagu went
away again. After dinner come Mr. John Wright and Mr. Moore, with the
sight of whom my heart was very glad. They brought an order for my
Lord's coming up to London, which my Lord resolved to do tomorrow. All
the afternoon getting my things in order to set forth to-morrow. At
night walked up and down with Mr. Moore, who did give me an account of
all things at London. Among others, how the Presbyterians would be angry
if they durst, but they will not be able to do any thing. Most of the
Commanders on board and supped with my Lord. Late at night came Mr. Edw.
Pickering from London, but I could not see him this night. I went with
Mr. Moore to the Master's cabin, and saw him there in order to going to
bed. After that to my own cabin to put things in order and so to bed.

8th. Out early, took horses at Deale. I troubled much with the King's
gittar, and Fairbrother, the rogue that I intrusted with the carrying of
it on foot, whom I thought I had lost. Col. Dixwell's horse taken by a
soldier and delivered to my Lord, and by him to me to carry to London.

Becket's tomb. To Sittiligborne and Rochester. At Chatham and Rochester

went this day to Huntsmore for her things, and I was very lonely all
night. This evening my wife's brother, Balty, came to me to let me know

upon a place for a gentleman, that may not stain his family when, God
help him, he wants bread.

19th. Called on betimes by Murford, who showed me five pieces to get a
business done for him and I am resolved to do it., Much business at my
Lord's. This morning my Lord went into the House of Commons, and there
had the thanks of the House, in the name of the Parliament and Commons
of England, for his late service to his King and Country. A motion was
made for a reward for him, but it was quashed by Mr. Annesly, who, above
most men, is engaged to my Lord's and Mr. Crew's families. Meeting with
Captain Stoakes at Whitehall, I dined with him and Mr. Gullop, a
parson (with whom afterwards I was much offended at his importunity and
impertinence, such another as Elborough),

     [Thomas Elborough was one of Pepys's schoolfellows, and afterwards
     curate of St. Lawrence Poultney.]

and Mr. Butler, who complimented much after the same manner as the
parson did. After that towards my Lord's at Mr. Crew's, but was met with
by a servant of my Lady Pickering, who took me to her and she told me
the story of her husband's case and desired my assistance with my Lord,
and did give me, wrapped up in paper, L5 in silver. After that to my
Lord's, and with him to Whitehall and my Lady Pickering. My Lord went
at night with the King to Baynard's Castle' to supper, and I home to my
father's to bed. My wife and the girl and dog came home to-day. When I

whom. We hear of W. Howe being sick to-day, but he was well at night.

20th. Up by 4 in the morning to write letters to sea and a commission
for him that Murford solicited for. Called on by Captain Sparling, who
did give me my Dutch money again, and so much as he had changed into
English money, by which my mind was eased of a great deal of trouble.
Some other sea captains. I did give them a good morning draught, and so
to my Lord (who lay long in bed this day, because he came home late from
supper with the King). With my Lord to the Parliament House, and, after
that, with him to General Monk's, where he dined at the Cock-pit. I home
and dined with my wife, now making all things ready there again. Thence
to my Lady Pickering, who did give me the best intelligence about the
Wardrobe. Afterwards to the Cockpit to my Lord with Mr. Townsend, one
formerly and now again to be employed as Deputy of the Wardrobe. Thence
to the Admiralty, and despatched away Mr. Cooke to sea; whose business
was a letter from my Lord about Mr. G. Montagu to be chosen as
a Parliament-man in my Lord's room at Dover;' and another to the
Vice-Admiral to give my Lord a constant account of all things in the
fleet, merely that he may thereby keep up his power there; another
letter to Captn. Cuttance to send the barge that brought the King on
shore, to Hinchingbroke by Lynne. To my own house, meeting G. Vines,
and drank with him at Charing Cross, now the King's Head Tavern. With

a fanatic and a very rogue in other parts of the Diary.]--an old
hypocrite, and with him, his friend and my father, and my cozen Scott to
the Bear Tavern. To my father's and to bed.

21st. To my Lord, much business. With him to the Council Chamber, where
he was sworn; and the charge of his being admitted Privy Counsellor is
L26. To the Dog Tavern at Westminster, where Murford with Captain Curle
and two friends of theirs went to drink. Captain Curle, late of the
Maria, gave me five pieces in gold and a silver can for my wife for the
Commission I did give him this day for his ship, dated April 20, 1660
last. Thence to the Parliament door and came to Mr. Crew's to dinner
with my Lord, and with my Lord to see the great Wardrobe, where Mr.
Townsend brought us to the governor of some poor children in tawny
clothes; who had been maintained there these eleven years, which put my
Lord to a stand how to dispose of them, that he may have the house for
his use. The children did sing finely, and my Lord did bid me give them
five pieces in gold at his going away. Thence back to White Hall,
where, the King being gone abroad, my Lord and I walked a great while
discoursing of the simplicity of the Protector, in his losing all that
his father had left him. My Lord told me, that the last words that he
parted with the Protector with (when he went to the Sound), were, that
he should rejoice more to see him in his grave at his return home, than
that he should give way to such things as were then in hatching, and
afterwards did ruin him: and the Protector said, that whatever G.
Montagu, my Lord Broghill, Jones, and the Secretary, would have him to
do, he would do it, be it what it would. Thence to my wife, meeting
Mr. Blagrave, who went home with me, and did give me a lesson upon
the flageolet, and handselled my silver can with my wife and me. To
my father's, where Sir Thomas Honeywood and his family were come of a
sudden, and so we forced to lie all together in a little chamber, three
stories high.

22d. To my Lord, where much business. With him to White Hall, where the
Duke of York not being up, we walked a good while in the Shield Gallery.
Mr. Hill (who for these two or three days hath constantly attended my
Lord) told me of an offer of L500 for a Baronet's dignity, which I told
my Lord of in the balcone in this gallery, and he said he would think of
it. I to my Lord's and gave order for horses to be got to draw my Lord's
great coach to Mr. Crew's. Mr. Morrice the upholsterer came himself
to-day to take notice what furniture we lack for our lodgings at
Whitehall. My dear friend Mr. Fuller of Twickenham and I dined alone at
the Sun Tavern, where he told me how he had the grant of being Dean
of St. Patrick's, in Ireland; and I told him my condition, and both
rejoiced one for another. Thence to my Lord's, and had the great coach
to Brigham's, who went with me to the Half Moon, and gave me a can of
good julep, and told me how my Lady Monk deals with him and others
for their places, asking him L500, though he was formerly the King's
coach-maker, and sworn to it. My Lord abroad, and I to my house and
set things in a little order there. So with Mr. Moore to my father's, I
staying with Mrs. Turner who stood at her door as I passed. Among other
things she told me for certain how my old Lady Middlesex----herself the
other day in the presence of the King, and people took notice of it.
Thence called at my father's, and so to Mr. Crew's, where Mr. Hetley had
sent a letter for me, and two pair of silk stockings, one for W. Howe,
and the other for me. To Sir H. Wright's to my Lord, where he, was, and
took direction about business, and so by link home about 11 o'clock. To
bed, the first time since my coming from sea, in my own house, for which
God be praised.

23d. By water with Mr. Hill towards my Lord's lodging and so to my
Lord. With him to Whitehall, where I left him and went to Mr. Holmes to
deliver him the horse of Dixwell's that had staid there fourteen days at
the Bell. So to my Lord's lodgings, where Tom Guy came to me, and there
staid to see the King touch people for the King's evil. But he did not
come at all, it rayned so; and the poor people were forced to stand all
the morning in the rain in the garden. Afterward he touched them in the
Banquetting-house.

     [This ceremony is usually traced to Edward the Confessor, but there
     is no direct evidence of the early Norman kings having touched for
     the evil.  Sir John Fortescue, in his defence of the House of
     Lancaster against that of York, argued that the crown could not
     descend to a female, because the Queen is not qualified by the form
     of anointing her, used at the coronation, to cure the disease called
     the King's evil.  Burn asserts, "History of Parish Registers," 1862,
     p. 179, that "between 1660 and 1682, 92,107 persons were touched for
     the evil."  Everyone coming to the court for that purpose, brought a
     certificate signed by the minister and churchwardens, that he had
     not at any time been touched by His Majesty.  The practice was
     supposed to have expired with the Stuarts, but the point being
     disputed, reference was made to the library of the Duke of Sussex,
     and four several Oxford editions of the Book of Common Prayer were
     found, all printed after the accession of the house of Hanover, and
     all containing, as an integral part of the service, "The Office for
     the Healing."  The stamp of gold with which the King crossed the
     sore of the sick person was called an angel, and of the value of ten
     shillings.  It had a hole bored through it, through which a ribbon
     was drawn, and the angel was hanged about the patient's neck till
     the cure was perfected.  The stamp has the impression of St. Michael
     the Archangel on one side, and a ship in full sail on the other.
     "My Lord Anglesey had a daughter cured of the King's evil with three
     others on Tuesday."--MS.  Letter of William Greenhill to Lady Bacon,
     dated December 31st, 1629, preserved at Audley End.  Charles II.
     "touched" before he came to the throne.  "It is certain that the
     King hath very often touched the sick, as well at Breda, where he
     touched 260 from Saturday the 17 of April to Sunday the 23 of May,
     as at Bruges and Bruxels, during the residence he made there; and
     the English assure...  it was not without success, since it was
     the experience that drew thither every day, a great number of those
     diseased even from the most remote provinces of Germany."--Sir
     William Lower's Relation of the Voiage and Residence which Charles
     the II. hath made in Holland, Hague, 1660, p. 78.  Sir William Lower
     gives a long account of the touching for the evil by Charles before
     the Restoration.]

With my Lord, to my Lord Frezendorfe's, where he dined to-day. Where he
told me that he had obtained a promise of the Clerk of the Acts place
for me, at which I was glad. Met with Mr. Chetwind, and dined with him
at Hargrave's, the Cornchandler, in St. Martin's Lane, where a good
dinner, where he showed me some good pictures, and an instrument he
called an Angelique.

     [An angelique is described as a species of guitar in Murray's "New
     English Dictionary," and this passage from the Diary is given as a
     quotation.  The word appears as angelot in Phillips's "English
     Dictionary" (1678), and is used in Browning's "Sordello," as a
     "plaything of page or girl."]

With him to London, changing all my Dutch money at Backwell's

     [Alderman Edward Backwell, an eminent banker and goldsmith, who is
     frequently mentioned in the Diary.  His shop was in Lombard Street.
     He was ruined by the closing of the Exchequer by Charles II. in
     1672.  The crown then owed him L295,994 16s. 6d., in lieu of which
     the King gave him an annuity of L17,759 13s. 8d.  Backwell retired
     into Holland after the closing of the Exchequer, and died there in
     1679.  See Hilton Price's "Handbook of London Bankers," 1876.]

for English, and then to Cardinal's Cap, where he and the City
Remembrancer who paid for all. Back to Westminster, where my Lord was,
and discoursed with him awhile about his family affairs. So he went
away, I home and wrote letters into the country, and to bed.

24th. Sunday. Drank my morning draft at Harper's, and bought a pair of
gloves there. So to Mr. G. Montagu, and told him what I had received
from Dover, about his business likely to be chosen there. So home and
thence with my wife towards my father's. She went thither, I to Mr.
Crew's, where I dined and my Lord at my Lord Montagu of Boughton in
Little Queen Street. In the afternoon to Mr. Mossum's with Mr. Moore,
and we sat in Mr. Butler's pew. Then to Whitehall looking for my Lord
but in vain, and back again to Mr. Crew's where I found him and did give
him letters. Among others some simple ones from our Lieutenant, Lieut.
Lambert to him and myself, which made Mr. Crew and us all laugh. I went
to my father's to tell him that I would not come to supper, and so after
my business done at Mr. Crew's I went home and my wife within a little
while after me, my mind all this while full of thoughts for my place of
Clerk of the Acts.

25th. With my Lord at White Hall, all the morning. I spoke with Mr.
Coventry about my business, who promised me all the assistance I could
expect. Dined with young Mr. Powell, lately come from the Sound, being
amused at our great changes here, and Mr. Southerne, now Clerk to Mr.
Coventry, at the Leg in King-street. Thence to the Admiralty, where I
met with Mr. Turner

     [Thomas Turner (or Tourner) was General Clerk at the Navy Office,
     and on June 30th he offered Pepys L150 to be made joint Clerk of the
     Acts with him.  In a list of the Admiralty officers just before the
     King came in, preserved in the British Museum, there occur, Richard
     Hutchinson; Treasury of the Navy, salary L1500; Thomas Tourner,
     General Clerk, for himself and clerk, L100.]

of the Navy-office, who did look after the place of Clerk of the Acts.
He was very civil to me, and I to him, and shall be so. There came
a letter from my Lady Monk to my Lord about it this evening, but he
refused to come to her, but meeting in White Hall, with Sir Thomas
Clarges, her brother, my Lord returned answer, that he could not desist
in my business; and that he believed that General Monk would take it
ill if my Lord should name the officers in his army; and therefore he
desired to have the naming of one officer in the fleet. With my Lord by
coach to Mr. Crew's, and very merry by the way, discoursing of the late
changes and his good fortune. Thence home, and then with my wife to
Dorset House, to deliver a list of the names of the justices of the
peace for Huntingdonshire. By coach, taking Mr. Fox part of the way with
me, that was with us with the King on board the Nazeby, who I found
to have married Mrs. Whittle, that lived at Mr. Geer's so long. A very
civil gentleman. At Dorset House I met with Mr. Kipps, my old friend,
with whom the world is well changed, he being now sealbearer to the Lord
Chancellor, at which my wife and I are well pleased, he being a very
good natured man. Home and late writing letters. Then to my Lord's
lodging, this being the first night of his coming to Whitehall to lie
since his coming from sea.

26th. My Lord dined at his lodgings all alone to-day. I went to
Secretary Nicholas

     [Sir Edward Nicholas, Secretary of State to Charles I. and II.
     He was dismissed from his office through the intrigues of Lady
     Castlemaine in 1663.  He died 1669, aged seventy-seven.]

to carry him my Lord's resolutions about his title, which he had chosen,
and that is Portsmouth.

     [Montagu changed his mind, and ultimately took his title from the
     town of Sandwich, leaving that of Portsmouth for the use of a King's
     mistress.]

I met with Mr. Throgmorton, a merchant, who went with me to the old
Three Tuns, at Charing Cross, who did give me five pieces of gold for to
do him a small piece of service about a convoy to Bilbo, which I did. In
the afternoon, one Mr. Watts came to me, a merchant, to offer me L500 if
I would desist from the Clerk of the Acts place. I pray God direct me in
what I do herein. Went to my house, where I found my father, and carried
him and my wife to Whitefriars, and myself to Puddlewharf, to
the Wardrobe, to Mr. Townsend, who went with me to Backwell, the
goldsmith's, and there we chose L100 worth of plate for my Lord to give
Secretary Nicholas. Back and staid at my father's, and so home to bed.

27th. With my Lord to the Duke, where he spoke to Mr. Coventry to
despatch my business of the Acts, in which place every body gives me
joy, as if I were in it, which God send.

     [The letters patent, dated July 13th, 12 Charles II., recite and
     revoke letters patent of February 16th, 14 Charles I., whereby the
     office of Clerk of the Ships had been given to Dennis Fleming and
     Thomas Barlow, or the survivor.  D. F. was then dead, but T. B.
     living, and Samuel Pepys was appointed in his room, at a salary of
     L33 6s. 8d. per annum, with 3s. 4d. for each day employed in
     travelling, and L6 per annum for boathire, and all fees due.  This
     salary was only the ancient "fee out of the Exchequer," which had
     been attached to the office for more than a century.  Pepys's salary
     had been previously fixed at L350 a year.]

Dined with my Lord and all the officers of his regiment, who invited my
Lord and his friends, as many as he would bring, to dinner, at the Swan,
at Dowgate, a poor house and ill dressed, but very good fish and plenty.
Here Mr. Symons, the Surgeon, told me how he was likely to lose his
estate that he had bought, at which I was not a little pleased. To
Westminster, and with Mr. Howe by coach to the Speaker's, where my Lord
supped with the King, but I could not get in. So back again, and after
a song or two in my chamber in the dark, which do (now that the bed is
out) sound very well, I went home and to bed.

28th. My brother Tom came to me with patterns to choose for a suit.
I paid him all to this day, and did give him L10 upon account. To Mr.
Coventry, who told me that he would do me all right in my business. To
Sir G. Downing, the first visit I have made him since he came. He is
so stingy a fellow I care not to see him; I quite cleared myself of his
office, and did give him liberty to take any body in. Hawly and he are
parted too, he is going to serve Sir Thos. Ingram. I went also this
morning to see Mrs. Pierce, the chirurgeon['s wife]. I found her in bed
in her house in Margaret churchyard. Her husband returned to sea. I did
invite her to go to dinner with me and my wife to-day. After all this to
my Lord, who lay a-bed till eleven o'clock, it being almost five before
he went to bed, they supped so late last night with the King. This
morning I saw poor Bishop Wren

     [Matthew Wren, born 1585, successively Bishop of Hereford, Norwich,
     and Ely.  At the commencement of the Rebellion he was sent to the
     Tower, and remained a prisoner there eighteen years.  Died April
     24th, 1667.]

going to Chappel, it being a thanksgiving-day

     ["A Proclamation for setting apart a day of Solemn and Publick
     Thanksgiving throughout the whole Kingdom," dated June 5th, 1660.]

for the King's return. After my Lord was awake, I went up to him to the
Nursery, where he do lie, and, having talked with him a little, I took
leave and carried my wife and Mrs. Pierce to Clothworkers'-Hall, to
dinner, where Mr. Pierce, the Purser, met us. We were invited by Mr.
Chaplin, the Victualler, where Nich. Osborne was. Our entertainment very
good, a brave hall, good company, and very good music. Where among other
things I was pleased that I could find out a man by his voice, whom I
had never seen before, to be one that sang behind the curtaine
formerly at Sir W. Davenant's opera. Here Dr. Gauden and Mr. Gauden the
victualler dined with us. After dinner to Mr. Rawlinson's,

     [Daniel Rawlinson kept the Mitre in Fenchurch Street, and there is a
     farthing token of his extant, "At the Mitetr in Fenchurch Streete,
     D. M. R."  The initials stand for Daniel and Margaret Rawlinson (see
     "Boyne's Trade Tokens," ed.  Williamson, vol. i., 1889, p. 595) In
     "Reliquiae Hearnianae" (ed.  Bliss, 1869, vol. ii.  p. 39) is the
     following extract from Thomas Rawlinson's Note Book R.: "Of Daniel
     Rawlinson, my grandfather, who kept the Mitre tavern in Fenchurch
     Street, and of whose being sequestred in the Rump time I have heard
     much, the Whiggs tell this, that upon the king's murder he hung his
     signe in mourning.  He certainly judged right.  The honour of the
     Mitre was much eclipsed through the loss of so good a parent of the
     church of England.  These rogues say, this endeared him so much to
     the churchmen that he soon throve amain and got a good estate."
     Mrs. Rawlinson died of the plague (see August 9th, 1666), and the
     house was burnt in the Great Fire.  Mr. Rawlinson rebuilt the Mitre,
     and he had the panels of the great room painted with allegorical
     figures by Isaac Fuller.  Daniel was father of Sir Thomas Rawlinson,
     of whom Thomas Hearne writes (October 1st, 1705): "Sir Thomas
     Rawlinson is chosen Lord Mayor of London for ye ensueing
     notwithstanding the great opposition of ye Whigg party" (Hearne's
     "Collections," ed. Doble, 1885, vol. i.  p. 51).  The well-known
     antiquaries, Thomas and Richard Rawlinson, sons of Sir Thomas, were
     therefore grandsons of Daniel.]

to see him and his wife, and would have gone to my Aunt Wight, but that
her only child, a daughter, died last night. Home and to my Lord, who
supped within, and Mr. E. Montagu, Mr. Thos. Crew, and others with him
sat up late. I home and to bed.

29th. This day or two my maid Jane--[Jane Wayneman.]--has been lame,
that we cannot tell what to do for want of her. Up and to White Hall,
where I got my warrant from the Duke to be Clerk of the Acts. Also I
got my Lord's warrant from the Secretary for his honour of Earle of
Portsmouth, and Viscount Montagu of Hinchingbroke. So to my Lord, to
give him an account of what I had done. Then to Sir Geffery Palmer, to
give them to him to have bills drawn upon them, who told me that my Lord
must have some good Latinist to make the preamble to his Patent, which
must express his late service in the best terms that he can, and he told
me in what high flaunting terms Sir J. Greenville had caused his to
be done, which he do not like; but that Sir Richard Fanshawe had done
General Monk's very well. Back to Westminster, and meeting Mr. Townsend
in the Palace, he and I and another or two went and dined at the Leg
there. Then to White Hall, where I was told by Mr. Hutchinson at the
Admiralty, that Mr. Barlow, my predecessor, Clerk of the Acts, is yet
alive, and coming up to town to look after his place, which made my
heart sad a little. At night told my Lord thereof, and he bade me get
possession of my Patent; and he would do all that could be done to keep
him out. This night my Lord and I looked over the list of the Captains,.
and marked some that my Lord had a mind to have put out. Home and to
bed. Our wench very lame, abed these two days.

30th. By times to Sir R. Fanshawe to draw up the preamble to my Lord's
Patent. So to my Lord, and with him to White Hall, where I saw a great
many fine antique heads of marble, that my Lord Northumberland had given
the King. Here meeting with Mr. De Cretz, he looked over many of the
pieces, in the gallery with me and told me [by] whose hands they were,
with great pleasure. Dined at home and Mr. Hawly with me upon six of my
pigeons, which my wife has resolved to kill here. This day came Will,

     [William Wayneman was constantly getting into trouble, and Pepys had
     to cane him.  He was dismissed on July 7th, 1663.]

my boy, to me; the wench continuing lame, so that my wife could not be
longer without somebody to help her. In the afternoon with Sir Edward
Walker, at his lodgings by St. Giles Church, for my Lord's pedigree, and
carried it to Sir R. Fanshawe. To Mr. Crew's, and there took money and
paid Mrs. Anne, Mrs. Jemima's maid, off quite, and so she went away and
another came to her. To White Hall with Mr. Moore, where I met with
a letter from Mr. Turner, offering me L150 to be joined with me in my
patent, and to advise me how to improve the advantage of my place, and
to keep off Barlow. To my Lord's till late at night, and so home.




JULY 1660

July 1st. This morning came home my fine Camlett cloak,

     [Camlet was a mixed stuff of wool and silk.  It was very expensive,
     and later Pepys gave L24 for a suit.  (See June 1st, 1664.)]

with gold buttons, and a silk suit, which cost me much money, and I pray
God to make me able to pay for it. I went to the cook's and got a good
joint of meat, and my wife and I dined at home alone. In the afternoon
to the Abbey, where a good sermon by a stranger, but no Common Prayer
yet. After sermon called in at Mrs. Crisp's, where I saw Mynheer Roder,
that is to marry Sam Hartlib's sister, a great fortune for her to
light on, she being worth nothing in the world. Here I also saw Mrs.
Greenlife, who is come again to live in Axe Yard with her new husband
Mr. Adams. Then to my Lord's, where I staid a while. So to see for Mr.
Creed to speak about getting a copy of Barlow's patent. To my Lord's,
where late at night comes Mr. Morland, whom I left prating with my Lord,
and so home.

2nd. Infinite of business that my heart and head and all were full. Met
with purser Washington, with whom and a lady, a friend of his, I dined
at the Bell Tavern in King Street, but the rogue had no more manners
than to invite me and to let me pay my club. All the afternoon with my
Lord, going up and down the town; at seven at night he went home, and
there the principal Officers of the Navy,

     [A list of the Officers of the Admiralty, May 31st, 1660.  From a
     MS. in the Pepysian Library in Pepys's own handwriting.
     His Royal Highness James, Duke of York, Lord High Admiral.
     Sir George Carteret, Treasurer.
     Sir Robert Slingsby, (soon after) Comptroller.
     Sir William Batten, Surveyor.
     Samuel Pepys, Esq., Clerk of the Acts.

     John, Lord Berkeley (of Stratton,)|
     Sir William Penn,                 | Commissioners.
     Peter Pett, Esq.--B,]             |

among the rest myself was reckoned one. We had order to meet to-morrow,
to draw up such an order of the Council as would put us into action
before our patents were passed. At which my heart was glad. At night
supped with my Lord, he and I together, in the great dining-room alone
by ourselves, the first time I ever did it in London. Home to bed, my
maid pretty well again.

3d. All the morning the Officers and Commissioners of the Navy, we met
at Sir G. Carteret's

     [Sir George Carteret, born 1599, had originally been bred to the sea
     service, and became Comptroller of the Navy to Charles I., and
     Governor of Jersey, where he obtained considerable reputation by his
     gallant defence of that island against the Parliament forces.  At
     the Restoration he was made Vice-Chamberlain to the King, Treasurer
     of the Navy, and a Privy Councillor, and in 1661 he was elected M.P.
     for Portsmouth.  In 1666 he exchanged the Treasurership of the Navy
     with the Earl of Anglesea for the Vice-Treasurership of Ireland.  He
     became a Commissioner of the Admiralty in 1673.  He continued in
     favour with Charles II. till his death, January 14th, 1679, in his
     eightieth year.  He married his cousin Elizabeth, daughter of Sir
     Philip Carteret, Knight of St. Ouen, and had issue three sons and
     five daughters.]

chamber, and agreed upon orders for the Council to supersede the old
ones, and empower us to act. Dined with Mr. Stephens, the Treasurer's
man of the Navy, and Mr. Turner, to whom I offered L50 out of my own
purse for one year, and the benefit of a Clerk's allowance beside, which
he thanked me for; but I find he hath some design yet in his head, which
I could not think of. In the afternoon my heart was quite pulled down,
by being told that Mr. Barlow was to enquire to-day for Mr. Coventry;
but at night I met with my Lord, who told me that I need not fear, for
he would get me the place against the world. And when I came to W. Howe,
he told me that Dr. Petty had been with my Lord, and did tell him
that Barlow was a sickly man, and did not intend to execute the place
himself, which put me in great comfort again. Till 2 in the morning
writing letters and things for my Lord to send to sea. So home to my
wife to bed.

4th. Up very early in the morning and landing my wife at White Friars
stairs, I went to the Bridge and so to the Treasurer's of the Navy, with
whom I spake about the business of my office, who put me into very good
hopes of my business. At his house comes Commissioner Pett, and he and I
went to view the houses in Seething Lane, belonging to the Navy,

     [The Navy Office was erected on the site of Lumley House, formerly
     belonging to the Fratres Sancta Crucis (or Crutched Friars), and all
     business connected with naval concerns was transacted there till its
     removal to Somerset House.--The ground was afterwards occupied by
     the East India Company's warehouses.  The civil business of the
     Admiralty was removed from Somerset House to Spring Gardens in
     1869.]

where I find the worst very good, and had great fears in my mind that
they will shuffle me out of them, which troubles me. From thence to the
Excise Office in Broad Street, where I received L500 for my Lord, by
appointment of the Treasurer, and went afterwards down with Mr. Luddyard
and drank my morning draft with him and other officers. Thence to Mr.
Backewell's, the goldsmith, where I took my Lord's L100 in plate for Mr.
Secretary Nicholas, and my own piece of plate, being a state dish and
cup in chased work for Mr. Coventry, cost me above L19. Carried these
and the money by coach to my Lord's at White Hall, and from thence
carried Nicholas's plate to his house and left it there, intending
to speak with him anon. So to Westminster Hall, where meeting with M.
L'Impertinent and W. Bowyer, I took them to the Sun Tavern, and gave
them a lobster and some wine, and sat talking like a fool till 4
o'clock. So to my Lord's, and walking all the afternoon in White Hall
Court, in expectation of what shall be done in the Council as to our
business. It was strange to see how all the people flocked together
bare, to see the King looking out of the Council window. At night my
Lord told me how my orders that I drew last night about giving us power
to act, are granted by the Council. At which he and I were very glad.
Home and to bed, my boy lying in my house this night the first time.

5th. This morning my brother Tom brought me my jackanapes coat with
silver buttons. It rained this morning, which makes us fear that the
glory of this great day will be lost; the King and Parliament being to
be entertained by the City to-day with great pomp.

     ["July 5th.  His Majesty, the two Dukes, the House of Lords, and the
     House of Commons, and the Privy Council, dined at the Guildhall.
     Every Hall appeared with their colours and streamers to attend His
     Majesty; the Masters in gold chains.  Twelve pageants in the streets
     between Temple Bar and Guildhall.  Forty brace of bucks were that
     day spent in the City of London."--Rugge's Diurnal.--B.]

Mr. Hater' was with me to-day, and I agreed with him to be my clerk.

     [Thomas Hayter.  He remained with Pepys for some time; and by his
     assistance was made Petty Purveyor of Petty Missions.  He succeeded
     Pepys as Clerk of the Acts in 1673, and in 1679 he was Secretary of
     the Admiralty, and Comptroller of the Navy from 1680 to 1682.]

Being at White Hall, I saw the King, the Dukes, and all their attendants
go forth in the rain to the City, and it bedraggled many a fine suit of
clothes. I was forced to walk all the morning in White Hall, not knowing
how to get out because of the rain. Met with Mr. Cooling, my Lord
Chamberlain's secretary, who took me to dinner among the gentlemen
waiters, and after dinner into the wine-cellar. He told me how he had
a project for all us Secretaries to join together, and get money by
bringing all business into our hands. Thence to the Admiralty, where Mr.
Blackburne and I (it beginning to hold up) went and walked an hour or
two in the Park, he giving of me light in many things in my way in this
office that I go about. And in the evening I got my present of plate
carried to Mr. Coventry's. At my Lord's at night comes Dr. Petty to me,
to tell me that Barlow had come to town, and other things, which put me
into a despair, and I went to bed very sad.

6th. In the morning with my Lord at Whitehall, got the order of the
Council for us to act. From thence to Westminster Hall, and there met
with the Doctor that shewed us so much kindness at the Hague, and took
him to the Sun tavern, and drank with him. So to my Lord's and dined
with W. Howe and Sarah, thinking it might be the last time that I
might dine with them together. In the afternoon my Lord and I, and
Mr. Coventry and Sir G. Carteret, went and took possession of the Navy
Office, whereby my mind was a little cheered, but my hopes not great.
From thence Sir G. Carteret and I to the Treasurer's Office, where he
set some things in order. And so home, calling upon Sir Geoffry Palmer,
who did give me advice about my patent, which put me to some doubt to
know what to do, Barlow being alive. Afterwards called at Mr. Pim's,
about getting me a coat of velvet, and he took me to the Half Moon, and
the house so full that we staid above half an hour before we could get
anything. So to my Lord's, where in the dark W. Howe and I did sing
extemporys, and I find by use that we are able to sing a bass and a
treble pretty well. So home, and to bed.

7th. To my Lord, one with me to buy a Clerk's place, and I did demand
L100. To the Council Chamber, where I took an order for the advance of
the salaries of the officers of the Navy, and I find mine to be raised
to L350 per annum. Thence to the Change, where I bought two fine prints
of Ragotti from Rubens, and afterwards dined with my Uncle and Aunt
Wight, where her sister Cox and her husband were. After that to Mr.
Rawlinson's with my uncle, and thence to the Navy Office, where I began
to take an inventory of the papers, and goods, and books of the office.
To my Lord's, late writing letters. So home to bed.

8th (Lord's day). To White Hall chapel, where I got in with ease by
going before the Lord Chancellor with Mr. Kipps. Here I heard very good
music, the first time that ever I remember to have heard the organs and
singing-men in surplices in my life.

     [During the Commonwealth organs were destroyed all over the country,
     and the following is the title of the Ordinances under which this
     destruction took place: "Two Ordinances of the Lords and Commons
     assembled in Parliament, for the speedy demolishing of all organs,
     images, and all matters of superstitious monuments in all Cathedrals
     and Collegiate or Parish Churches and Chapels throughout the Kingdom
     of England and the dominion of Wales; the better to accomplish the
     blessed reformation so happily begun, and to remove all offences and
     things illegal in the worship of God.  Dated May 9th, 1644."  When
     at the period of the Restoration music again obtained its proper
     place in the services of the Church, there was much work for the
     organ builders.  According to Dr. Rimbault ("Hopkins on the Organ,"
     1855, p. 74), it was more than fifty years after the Restoration
     when our parish churches began commonly to be supplied with organs.
     Drake says, in his "Eboracum" (published in 1733), that at that date
     only one parish church in the city of York possessed an organ.
     Bernard Schmidt, better known as "Father Smith," came to England
     from Germany at the time of the Restoration, and he it was who built
     the organ at the Chapel Royal.  He was in high favour with Charles
     II., who allowed, him apartments in Whitehall Palace.]

The Bishop of Chichester preached before the King, and made a great
flattering sermon, which I did not like that Clergy should meddle with
matters of state. Dined with Mr. Luellin and Salisbury at a cook's shop.
Home, and staid all the afternoon with my wife till after sermon. There
till Mr. Fairebrother came to call us out to my father's to supper. He
told me how he had perfectly procured me to be made Master in Arts by
proxy, which did somewhat please me, though I remember my cousin Roger
Pepys was the other day persuading me from it. While we were at supper
came Win. Howe to supper to us, and after supper went home to bed.

9th. All the morning at Sir G. Palmer's advising about getting my bill
drawn. From thence to the Navy office, where in the afternoon we met and
sat, and there I begun to sign bills in the Office the first time. From
thence Captain Holland and Mr. Browne of Harwich took me to a tavern and
did give me a collation. From thence to the Temple to further my bills
being done, and so home to my Lord, and thence to bed.

10th. This day I put on first my new silk suit, the first that ever I
wore in my life. This morning came Nan Pepys' husband Mr. Hall to see
me being lately come to town. I had never seen him before. I took him to
the Swan tavern with Mr. Eglin and there drank our morning draft. Home,
and called my wife, and took her to Dr. Clodius's to a great wedding of
Nan Hartlib to Mynheer Roder, which was kept at Goring House with very
great state, cost, and noble company. But, among all the beauties there,
my wife was thought the greatest. After dinner I left the company, and
carried my wife to Mrs. Turner's. I went to the Attorney-General's, and
had my bill which cost me seven pieces. I called my wife, and set her
home. And finding my Lord in White Hall garden, I got him to go to the
Secretary's, which he did, and desired the dispatch of his and my bills
to be signed by the King. His bill is to be Earl of Sandwich, Viscount
Hinchingbroke, and Baron of St. Neot's.

     [The motive for Sir Edward Montagu's so suddenly altering his
     intended title is not explained; probably, the change was adopted as
     a compliment to the town of Sandwich, off which the Fleet was lying
     before it sailed to bring Charles from Scheveling.  Montagu had also
     received marked attentions from Sir John Boys and other principal
     men at Sandwich; and it may be recollected, as an additional reason,
     that one or both of the seats for that borough have usually been
     placed at the disposal of the Admiralty.  The title of Portsmouth
     was given, in 1673, for her life, to the celebrated Louise de
     Querouaille, and becoming extinct with her, was, in 1743, conferred
     upon John Wallop, Viscount Lymington, the ancestor of the present
     Earl of Portsmouth.--B.]

Home, with my mind pretty quiet: not returning, as I said I would, to
see the bride put to bed.

11th. With Sir W. Pen by water to the Navy office, where we met, and
dispatched business. And that being done, we went all to dinner to the
Dolphin, upon Major Brown's invitation. After that to the office again,
where I was vexed, and so was Commissioner Pett, to see a busy fellow
come to look out the best lodgings for my Lord Barkley, and the
combining between him and Sir W. Pen; and, indeed, was troubled much
at it. Home to White Hall, and took out my bill signed by the King, and
carried it to Mr. Watkins of the Privy Seal to be despatched there, and
going home to take a cap, I borrowed a pair of sheets of Mr. Howe, and
by coach went to the Navy office, and lay (Mr. Hater, my clerk, with me)
at Commissioner Willoughby's' house, where I was received by him very
civilly and slept well.

12th. Up early and by coach to White Hall with Commissioner Pett, where,
after we had talked with my Lord, I went to the Privy Seal and got my
bill perfected there, and at the Signet: and then to the House of Lords,
and met with Mr. Kipps, who directed me to Mr. Beale to get my patent
engrossed; but he not having time to get it done in Chancery-hand, I was
forced to run all up and down Chancery-lane, and the Six Clerks' Office

     [The Six Clerks' Office was in Chancery Lane, near the Holborn end.
     The business of the office was to enrol commissions, pardons,
     patents, warrants, &c., that had passed the Great Seal; also other
     business in Chancery.  In the early history of the Court of
     Chancery, the Six Clerks and their under-clerks appear to have acted
     as the attorneys of the suitors.  As business increased, these
     under-clerks became a distinct body, and were recognized by the
     court under the denomination of 'sworn clerks,' or 'clerks in
     court.'  The advance of commerce, with its consequent accession of
     wealth, so multiplied the subjects requiring the judgment of a Court
     of Equity, that the limits of a public office were found wholly
     inadequate to supply a sufficient number of officers to conduct the
     business of the suitors.  Hence originated the 'Solicitors' of the
     "Court of Chancery."  See Smith's "Chancery Practice," p. 62, 3rd
     edit.  The "Six Clerks" were abolished by act of Parliament,
     5 Vict.  c. 5.]

but could find none that could write the hand, that were at leisure.
And so in a despair went to the Admiralty, where we met the first time
there, my Lord Montagu, my Lord Barkley, Mr. Coventry, and all the
rest of the principal Officers and Commissioners, [except] only the
Controller, who is not yet chosen. At night to Mr. Kipps's lodgings, but
not finding him, I went to Mr. Spong's and there I found him and got him
to come to me to my Lord's lodgings at 11 o'clock of night, when I got
him to take my bill to write it himself (which was a great providence
that he could do it) against to-morrow morning. I late writing letters
to sea by the post, and so home to bed. In great trouble because I heard
at Mr. Beale's to-day that Barlow had been there and said that he would
make a stop in the business.

13th. Up early, the first day that I put on my black camlett coat with
silver buttons. To Mr. Spong, whom I found in his night-down writing
of my patent, and he had done as far as he could "for that &c." by
8 o'clock. It being done, we carried it to Worcester House to the
Chancellor, where Mr. Kipps (a strange providence that he should now be
in a condition to do me a kindness, which I never thought him capable of
doing for me), got me the Chancellor's recepi to my bill; and so carried
it to Mr. Beale for a dockett; but he was very angry, and unwilling to
do it, because he said it was ill writ (because I had got it writ by
another hand, and not by him); but by much importunity I got Mr. Spong
to go to his office and make an end of my patent; and in the mean time
Mr. Beale to be preparing my dockett, which being done, I did give him
two pieces, after which it was strange how civil and tractable he was
to me. From thence I went to the Navy office, where we despatched much
business, and resolved of the houses for the Officers and Commissioners,
which I was glad of, and I got leave to have a door made me into the
leads. From thence, much troubled in mind about my patent, I went to Mr.
Beale again, who had now finished my patent and made it ready for the
Seal, about an hour after I went to meet him at the Chancellor's. So
I went away towards Westminster, and in my way met with Mr. Spong, and
went with him to Mr. Lilly and ate some bread and cheese, and drank with
him, who still would be giving me council of getting my patent out,
for fear of another change, and my Lord Montagu's fall. After that to
Worcester House, where by Mr. Kipps's means, and my pressing in General
Montagu's name to the Chancellor, I did, beyond all expectation, get my
seal passed; and while it was doing in one room, I was forced to keep
Sir G. Carteret (who by chance met me there, ignorant of my business) in
talk, while it was a doing. Went home and brought my wife with me into
London, and some money, with which I paid Mr. Beale L9 in all, and took
my patent of him and went to my wife again, whom I had left in a coach
at the door of Hinde Court, and presented her with my patent at which
she was overjoyed; so to the Navy office, and showed her my house, and
were both mightily pleased at all things there, and so to my business.
So home with her, leaving her at her mother's door. I to my Lord's,
where I dispatched an order for a ship to fetch Sir R. Honywood home,
for which I got two pieces of my Lady Honywood by young Mr. Powell. Late
writing letters; and great doings of music at the next house, which was
Whally's; the King and Dukes there with Madame Palmer,

     [Barbara Villiers, only child of William, second Viscount Grandison,
     born November, 1640, married April 14th, 1659, to Roger Palmer,
     created Earl of Castlemaine, 1661.  She became the King's mistress
     soon after the Restoration, and was in 1670 made Baroness Nonsuch,
     Countess of Southampton, and Duchess of Cleveland.  She had six
     children by the King, one of them being created Duke of Grafton, and
     the eldest son succeeding her as Duke of Cleveland.  She
     subsequently married Beau Fielding, whom she prosecuted for bigamy.
     She died October 9th, 1709, aged sixty-nine.  Her life was written
     by G. Steinman Steinman, and privately printed 1871, with addenda
     1874, and second addenda 1878.]

a pretty woman that they have a fancy to, to make her husband a cuckold.
Here at the old door that did go into his lodgings, my Lord, I, and W.
Howe, did stand listening a great while to the music. After that home to
bed. This day I should have been at Guildhall to have borne witness for
my brother Hawly against Black Collar, but I could not, at which I was
troubled. To bed with the greatest quiet of mind that I have had a
great while, having ate nothing but a bit of bread and cheese at Lilly's
to-day, and a bit of bread and butter after I was a-bed.

14th. Up early and advised with my wife for the putting of all our
things in a readiness to be sent to our new house. To my Lord's, where
he was in bed very late. So with Major Tollhurst and others to Harper's,
and I sent for my barrel of pickled oysters and there ate them; while we
were doing so, comes in Mr. Pagan Fisher; the poet, and promises me what
he had long ago done, a book in praise of the King of France, with my
armes, and a dedication to me very handsome. After him comes Mr. Sheply
come from sea yesterday, whom I was glad to see that he may ease me of
the trouble of my Lord's business. So to my Lord's, where I staid doing
his business and taking his commands. After that to Westminster Hall,
where I paid all my debts in order to my going away from hence. Here I
met with Mr. Eglin, who would needs take me to the Leg in King
Street and gave me a dish of meat to dinner; and so I sent for Mons.
L'Impertinent, where we sat long and were merry. After that parted, and
I took Mr. Butler [Mons. L'Impertinent] with me into London by coach
and shewed him my house at the Navy Office, and did give order for the
laying in coals. So into Fenchurch Street, and did give him a glass of
wine at Rawlinson's, and was trimmed in the street. So to my Lord's late
writing letters, and so home, where I found my wife had packed up all
her goods in the house fit for a removal. So to bed.

15th. Lay long in bed to recover my rest. Going forth met with Mr.
Sheply, and went and drank my morning draft with him at Wilkinson's,
and my brother Spicer.--[Jack Spicer, brother clerk of the Privy
Seal.]--After that to Westminster Abbey, and in Henry the Seventh's
Chappell heard part of a sermon, the first that ever I heard there. To
my Lord's and dined all alone at the table with him. After dinner he and
I alone fell to discourse, and I find him plainly to be a sceptic in all
things of religion, and to make no great matter of anything therein, but
to be a perfect Stoic. In the afternoon to Henry the Seventh's Chappell,
where I heard service and a sermon there, and after that meeting W.
Bowyer there, he and I to the Park, and walked a good while till night.
So to Harper's and drank together, and Captain Stokes came to us and so
I fell into discourse of buying paper at the first hand in my office,
and the Captain promised me to buy it for me in France. After that to
my Lord's lodgings, where I wrote some business and so home. My wife
at home all the day, she having no clothes out, all being packed up
yesterday. For this month I have wholly neglected anything of news, and
so have beyond belief been ignorant how things go, but now by my patent
my mind is in some quiet, which God keep. I was not at my father's
to-day, I being afraid to go for fear he should still solicit me to
speak to my Lord for a place in the Wardrobe, which I dare not do,
because of my own business yet. My wife and I mightily pleased with our
new house that we hope to have. My patent has cost me a great deal of
money, about L40, which is the only thing at present which do trouble
me much. In the afternoon to Henry the Seventh's chapel, where I heard
a sermon and spent (God forgive me) most of my time in looking upon Mrs.
Butler. After that with W. Bowyer to walk in the Park. Afterwards to
my Lord's lodgings, and so home to bed, having not been at my father's
to-day.

16th, This morning it proved very rainy weather so that I could not
remove my goods to my house. I to my office and did business there, and
so home, it being then sunrise, but by the time that I got to my house
it began to rain again, so that I could not carry my goods by cart as I
would have done. After that to my Lord's and so home and to bed.

17th. This morning (as indeed all the mornings nowadays) much business
at my Lord's. There came to my house before I went out Mr. Barlow, an
old consumptive man, and fair conditioned, with whom I did discourse a
great while, and after much talk I did grant him what he asked, viz.,
L50 per annum, if my salary be not increased, and (100 per annum, in
case it be to L350), at which he was very well pleased to be paid as I
received my money and not otherwise. Going to my Lord's I found my Lord
had got a great cold and kept his bed, and so I brought him to my Lord's
bedside, and he and I did agree together to this purpose what I should
allow him. That done and the day proving fair I went home and got all my
goods packed up and sent away, and my wife and I and Mrs. Hunt went by
coach, overtaking the carts a-drinking in the Strand. Being come to my
house and set in the goods, and at night sent my wife and Mrs. Hunt to
buy something for supper; they bought a Quarter of Lamb, and so we ate
it, but it was not half roasted. Will, Mr. Blackburne's nephew, is so
obedient, that I am greatly glad of him. At night he and I and Mrs. Hunt
home by water to Westminster. I to my Lord, and after having done some
business with him in his chamber in the Nursery, which has been now
his chamber since he came from sea, I went on foot with a linkboy to my
home, where I found my wife in bed and Jane washing the house, and Will
the boy sleeping, and a great deal of sport I had before I could wake
him. I to bed the first night that I ever lay here with my wife.

18th. This morning the carpenter made an end of my door out of my
chamber upon the leads.

This morning we met at the office: I dined at my house in Seething Lane,
and after that, going about 4 o'clock to Westminster, I met with Mr.
Carter and Mr. Cooke coming to see me in a coach, and so I returned
home. I did also meet with Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, with a porter with
him, with a barrel of Lemons, which my man Burr sends me from sea. I
took all these people home to my house and did give them some drink,
and after them comes Mr. Sheply, and after a little stay we all went by
water to Westminster as far as the New Exchange. Thence to my Lord
about business, and being in talk in comes one with half a buck from
Hinchinbroke, and it smelling a little strong my Lord did give it me
(though it was as good as any could be). I did carry it to my mother,
where I had not been a great while, and indeed had no great mind to go,
because my father did lay upon me continually to do him a kindness at
the Wardrobe, which I could not do because of my own business being so
fresh with my Lord. But my father was not at home, and so I did leave
the venison with her to dispose of as she pleased. After that home,
where W. Hewer now was, and did lie this night with us, the first night.
My mind very quiet, only a little trouble I have for the great debts
which I have still upon me to the Secretary, Mr. Kipps, and Mr. Spong
for my patent.

19th. I did lie late a-bed. I and my wife by water, landed her at
Whitefriars with her boy with an iron of our new range which is already
broke and my wife will have changed, and many other things she has to
buy with the help of my father to-day. I to my Lord and found him in
bed. This day I received my commission to swear people the oath of
allegiance and supremacy delivered me by my Lord. After talk with my
Lord I went to Westminster Hall, where I took Mr. Michell and his wife,
and Mrs. Murford we sent for afterwards, to the Dog Tavern, where I did
give them a dish of anchovies and olives and paid for all, and did talk
of our old discourse when we did use to talk of the King, in the time of
the Rump, privately; after that to the Admiralty Office, in White Hall,
where I staid and writ my last observations for these four days
last past. Great talk of the difference between the Episcopal and
Presbyterian Clergy, but I believe it will come to nothing. So home and
to bed.

20th. We sat at the office this morning, Sir W. Batten and Mr. Pett
being upon a survey to Chatham. This morning I sent my wife to my
father's and he is to give me L5 worth of pewter. After we rose at the
office, I went to my father's, where my Uncle Fenner and all his crew
and Captain Holland and his wife and my wife were at dinner at a venison
pasty of the venison that I did give my mother the other day. I did this
time show so much coldness to W. Joyce that I believe all the table took
notice of it. After that to Westminster about my Lord's business and so
home, my Lord having not been well these two or three days, and I hear
that Mr. Barnwell at Hinchinbroke is fallen sick again. Home and to bed.

21st. This morning Mr. Barlow had appointed for me to bring him what
form I would have the agreement between him and me to pass, which I did
to his lodgings at the Golden Eagle in the new street--[Still retains
the name New Street.]--between Fetter Lane and Shoe Lane, where he liked
it very well, and I from him went to get Mr. Spong to engross it in
duplicates. To my Lord and spoke to him about the business of the Privy
Seal for me to be sworn, though I got nothing by it, but to do Mr.
Moore a kindness, which he did give me a good answer to. Went to the Six
Clerks' office to Mr. Spong for the writings, and dined with him at a
club at the next door, where we had three voices to sing catches. So
to my house to write letters and so to Whitehall about business of my
Lord's concerning his creation,--[As Earl of Sandwich.]--and so home and
to bed.

22nd. Lord's day. All this last night it had rained hard. My brother Tom
came this morning the first time to see me, and I paid him all that I
owe my father to this day. Afterwards I went out and looked into several
churches, and so to my uncle Fenner's, whither my wife was got before
me, and we, my father and mother, and all the Joyces, and my aunt Bell,
whom I had not seen many a year before. After dinner to White Hall (my
wife to church with K. Joyce), where I find my Lord at home, and walked
in the garden with him, he showing me all the respect that can be. I
left him and went to walk in the Park, where great endeavouring to get
into the inward Park,--[This is still railed off from St. James's Park,
and called the Enclosure.]--but could not get in; one man was basted by
the keeper, for carrying some people over on his back through the water.
Afterwards to my Lord's, where I staid and drank with Mr. Sheply, having
first sent to get a pair of oars. It was the first time that ever I went
by water on the Lord's day. Home, and at night had a chapter read; and
I read prayers out of the Common Prayer Book, the first time that ever I
read prayers in this house. So to bed.

23rd. This morning Mr. Barlow comes to me, and he and I went forth to
a scrivener in Fenchurch Street, whom we found sick of the gout in bed,
and signed and sealed our agreement before him. He urged to have these
words (in consideration whereof) to be interlined, which I granted,
though against my will. Met this morning at the office, and afterwards
Mr. Barlow by appointment came and dined with me, and both of us very
pleasant and pleased. After dinner to my Lord, who took me to Secretary
Nicholas, and there before him and Secretary Morris, my Lord and I upon
our knees together took our oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; and the
Oath of the Privy Seal, of which I was much glad, though I am not likely
to get anything by it at present; but I do desire it, for fear of a
turn-out of our office. That done and my Lord gone from me, I went with
Mr. Cooling and his brother, and Sam Hartlibb, little Jennings and some
others to the King's Head Tavern at Charing Cross, where after drinking
I took boat and so home, where we supped merrily among ourselves (our
little boy proving a droll) and so after prayers to bed. This day my
Lord had heard that Mr. Barnwell was dead, but it is not so yet, though
he be very ill. I was troubled all this day with Mr. Cooke, being
willing to do him good, but my mind is so taken up with my own business
that I cannot.

24th. To White Hall, where I did acquaint Mr. Watkins with my being
sworn into the Privy Seal, at which he was much troubled, but put it up
and did offer me a kinsman of his to be my clerk, which I did give him
some hope of, though I never intend it. In the afternoon I spent much
time in walking in White Hall Court with Mr. Bickerstaffe, who was very
glad of my Lord's being sworn, because of his business with his
brother Baron, which is referred to my Lord Chancellor, and to be ended
to-morrow. Baron had got a grant beyond sea, to come in before the
reversionary of the Privy Seal. This afternoon Mr. Mathews came to me,
to get a certificate of my Lord's and my being sworn, which I put in
some forwardness, and so home and to bed.

25th. In the morning at the office, and after that down to Whitehall,
where I met with Mr. Creed, and with him and a Welsh schoolmaster, a
good scholar but a very pedagogue, to the ordinary at the Leg in King
Street.' I got my certificate of my Lord's and my being sworn. This
morning my Lord took leave of the House of Commons, and had the thanks
of the House for his great services to his country. In the afternoon
(but this is a mistake, for it was yesterday in the afternoon) Monsieur
L'Impertinent and I met and I took him to the Sun and drank with him,
and in the evening going away we met his mother and sisters and father
coming from the Gatehouse; where they lodge, where I did the first time
salute them all, and very pretty Madame Frances--[Frances Butler, the
beauty.]--is indeed. After that very late home and called in Tower
Street, and there at a barber's was trimmed the first time. Home and to
bed.

26th. Early to White Hall, thinking to have a meeting of my Lord and the
principal officers, but my Lord could not, it being the day that he
was to go and be admitted in the House of Lords, his patent being done,
which he presented upon his knees to the Speaker; and so it was read in
the House, and he took his place. I at the Privy Seal Office with Mr.
Hooker, who brought me acquainted with Mr. Crofts of the Signet, and
I invited them to a dish of meat at the Leg in King Street, and so we
dined there and I paid for all and had very good light given me as to my
employment there. Afterwards to Mr. Pierces, where I should have dined
but I could not, but found Mr. Sheply and W. Howe there. After we had
drunk hard we parted, and I went away and met Dr. Castle, who is one of
the Clerks of the Privy Seal, and told him how things were with my Lord
and me, which he received very gladly. I was this day told how Baron
against all expectation and law has got the place of Bickerstaffe, and
so I question whether he will not lay claim to wait the next month, but
my Lord tells me that he will stand for it. In the evening I met with T.
Doling, who carried me to St. James's Fair,

     [August, 1661: "This year the Fair, called St. James's Fair, was
     kept the full appointed time, being a fortnight; but during that
     time many lewd and infamous persons were by his Majesty's express
     command to the Lord Chamberlain, and his Lordship's direction to
     Robert Nelson, Esq., committed to the House of Correction."--Rugge's
     Diurnal.  St; James's fair was held first in the open space near St.
     James's Palace, and afterwards in St. James's Market.  It was
     prohibited by the Parliament in 1651, but revived at the
     Restoration.  It was, however, finally suppressed before the close
     of the reign of Charles II.]

and there meeting with W. Symons and his wife, and Luellin, and D.
Scobell's wife and cousin, we went to Wood's at the Pell Mell

     [This is one of the earliest references to Pall Mall as an inhabited
     street, and also one of the earliest uses of the word clubbing.]

(our old house for clubbing), and there we spent till 10 at night, at
which time I sent to my Lord's for my clerk Will to come to me, and so
by link home to bed. Where I found Commissioner Willoughby had sent
for all his things away out of my bedchamber, which is a little
disappointment, but it is better than pay too dear for them.

27th: The last night Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen came to their houses
at the office. Met this morning and did business till noon. Dined at
home and from thence to my Lord's where Will, my clerk, and I were all
the afternoon making up my accounts, which we had done by night, and I
find myself worth about L100 after all my expenses. At night I sent to
W. Bowyer to bring me L100, being that he had in his hands of my Lord's.
in keeping, out of which I paid Mr. Sheply all that remained due to my
Lord upon my balance, and took the rest home with me late at night. We
got a coach, but the horses were tired and could not carry us farther
than St. Dunstan's. So we 'light and took a link and so home weary to
bed.

28th. Early in the morning rose, and a boy brought me a letter from
Poet Fisher, who tells me that he is upon a panegyrique of the King,
and desired to borrow a piece of me; and I sent him half a piece. To
Westminster, and there dined with Mr. Sheply and W. Howe, afterwards
meeting with Mr. Henson, who had formerly had the brave clock that went
with bullets (which is now taken away from him by the King, it being his
goods).

     [Some clocks are still made with a small ball, or bullet, on an
     inclined plane, which turns every minute.  The King's clocks
     probably dropped bullets.  Gainsborough the painter had a brother
     who was a dissenting minister at Henley-on-Thames, and possessed a
     strong genius for mechanics.  He invented a clock of a very peculiar
     construction, which, after his death, was deposited in the British
     Museum.  It told the hour by a little bell, and was kept in motion
     by a leaden bullet, which dropped from a spiral reservoir at the top
     of the clock, into a little ivory bucket.  This was so contrived as
     to discharge it at the bottom, and by means of a counter-weight was
     carried up to the top of the clock, where it received another
     bullet, which was discharged as the former.  This seems to have been
     an attempt at the perpetual motion.--Gentleman's Magazine, 1785,
     p. 931.--B.]

I went with him to the Swan Tavern and sent for Mr. Butler, who was now
all full of his high discourse in praise of Ireland, whither he and his
whole family are going by Coll. Dillon's persuasion, but so many lies I
never heard in praise of anything as he told of Ireland. So home late at
night and to bed.

29th. Lord's day. I and my boy Will to Whitehall, and I with my Lord
to White Hall Chappell, where I heard a cold sermon of the Bishop of
Salisbury's, and the ceremonies did not please me, they do so overdo
them. My Lord went to dinner at Kensington with my Lord Camden. So I
dined and took Mr. Birfett, my Lord's chaplain, and his friend along
with me, with Mr. Sheply at my Lord's. In the afternoon with Dick Vines
and his brother Payton, we walked to Lisson Green and Marybone and back
again, and finding my Lord at home I got him to look over my accounts,
which he did approve of and signed them, and so we are even to this day.
Of this I was glad, and do think myself worth clear money about L120.
Home late, calling in at my father's without stay. To bed.

30th. Sat at our office to-day, and my father came this day the first
time to see us at my new office. And Mrs. Crisp by chance came in and
sat with us, looked over our house and advised about the furnishing of
it. This afternoon I got my L50, due to me for my first quarter's salary
as Secretary to my Lord, paid to Tho. Hater for me, which he received
and brought home to me, of which I am full glad. To Westminster and
among other things met with Mr. Moore, and took him and his friend, a
bookseller of Paul's Churchyard, to the Rhenish Winehouse, and drinking
there the sword-bearer of London (Mr. Man) came to ask for us, with whom
we sat late, discoursing about the worth of my office of Clerk of the
Acts, which he hath a mind to buy, and I asked four years' purchase. We
are to speak more of it to-morrow. Home on foot, and seeing him at home
at Butler's merry, he lent me a torch, which Will carried, and so home.

31st. To White Hall, where my Lord and the principal officers met, and
had a great discourse about raising of money for the Navy, which is in
very sad condition, and money must be raised for it. Mr. Blackburne, Dr.
Clerke, and I to the Quaker's and dined there. I back to the Admiralty,
and there was doing things in order to the calculating of the debts of
the Navy and other business, all the afternoon. At night I went to the
Privy Seal, where I found Mr. Crofts and Mathews making up all their
things to leave the office tomorrow, to those that come to wait the
next month. I took them to the Sun Tavern and there made them drink,
and discoursed concerning the office, and what I was to expect tomorrow
about Baron, who pretends to the next month. Late home by coach so far
as Ludgate with Mr. Mathews, and thence home on foot with W. Hewer with
me, and so to bed.




AUGUST 1660

August 1st. Up very early, and by water to Whitehall to my Lord's, and
there up to my Lord's lodging (Win. Howe being now ill of the gout at
Mr. Pierce's), and there talked with him about the affairs of the Navy,
and how I was now to wait today at the Privy Seal. Commissioner Pett
went with me, whom I desired to make my excuse at the office for my
absence this day. Hence to the Privy Seal Office, where I got (by
Mr. Mathews' means) possession of the books and table, but with some
expectation of Baron's bringing of a warrant from the King to have this
month. Nothing done this morning, Baron having spoke to Mr. Woodson and
Groome (clerks to Mr. Trumbull of the Signet) to keep all work in their
hands till the afternoon, at which time he expected to have his warrant
from the King for this month.--[The clerks of the Privy Seal took the
duty of attendance for a month by turns.]--I took at noon Mr. Harper
to the Leg in King Street, and did give him his dinner, who did still
advise me much to act wholly myself at the Privy Seal, but I told him
that I could not, because I had other business to take up my time. In
the afternoon at, the office again, where we had many things to sign;
and I went to the Council Chamber, and there got my Lord to sign the
first bill, and the rest all myself; but received no money today. After
I had signed all, I went with Dick Scobell and Luellin to drink at a
bottle beer house in the Strand, and after staying there a while (had
sent W. Hewer home before), I took boat and homewards went, and in Fish
Street bought a Lobster, and as I had bought it I met with Winter and
Mr. Delabarr, and there with a piece of sturgeon of theirs we went to
the Sun Tavern in the street and ate them. Late home and to bed.

2d. To Westminster by water with Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen (our
servants in another boat) to the Admiralty; and from thence I went to
my Lord's to fetch him thither, where we stayed in the morning about
ordering of money for the victuailers, and advising how to get a sum of
money to carry on the business of the Navy. From thence dined with Mr.
Blackburne at his house with his friends (his wife being in the country
and just upon her return to London), where we were very well treated and
merry. From thence W. Hewer and I to the office of Privy Seal, where
I stayed all the afternoon, and received about L40 for yesterday and
to-day, at which my heart rejoiced for God's blessing to me, to give me
this advantage by chance, there being of this L40 about L10 due to me
for this day's work. So great is the present profit of this office,
above what it was in the King's time; there being the last month about
300 bills; whereas in the late King's time it was much to have 40. With
my money home by coach, it, being the first time that I could get home
before our gates were shut since I came to the Navy office. When I came
home I found my wife not very well of her old pain.... which she had
when we were married first. I went and cast up the expense that I laid
out upon my former house (because there are so many that are desirous of
it, and I am, in my mind, loth to let it go out of my hands, for fear of
a turn). I find my layings-out to come to about L20, which with my fine
will come to about L22 to him that shall hire my house of me.--[Pepys
wished to let his house in Axe Yard now that he had apartments at the
Navy Office.]--To bed.

3rd. Up betimes this morning, and after the barber had done with me,
then to the office, where I and Sir William Pen only did meet and
despatch business. At noon my wife and I by coach to Dr. Clerke's to
dinner: I was very much taken with his lady, a comely, proper woman,
though not handsome; but a woman of the best language I ever heard. Here
dined Mrs. Pierce and her husband. After dinner I took leave to go
to Westminster, where I was at the Privy Seal Office all day, signing
things and taking money, so that I could not do as I had intended, that
is to return to them and go to the Red Bull Playhouse,

     [This well-known theatre was situated in St. John's Street on the
     site of Red Bull Yard.  Pepys went there on March 23rd, 1661, when
     he expressed a very poor opinion of the place.  T. Carew, in some
     commendatory lines on Sir William.  Davenant's play, "The just
     Italian," 1630, abuses both audiences and actors:--

              "There are the men in crowded heaps that throng
               To that adulterate stage, where not a tongue
               Of th' untun'd kennel can a line repeat
               Of serious sense."

     There is a token of this house (see "Boyne's Trade Tokens," ed.
     Williamson, vol. i., 1889, p. 725).]

but I took coach and went to see whether it was done so or no, and I
found it done. So I returned to Dr. Clerke's, where I found them and my
wife, and by and by took leave and went away home.

4th. To White Hall, where I found my Lord gone with the King by water
to dine at the Tower with Sir J. Robinson,' Lieutenant. I found my Lady
Jemimah--[Lady Jemima Montage, daughter of Lord Sandwich, previously
described as Mrs. Jem.]--at my Lord's, with whom I staid and dined, all
alone; after dinner to the Privy Seal Office, where I did business. So
to a Committee of Parliament (Sir Hen[eage] Finch, Chairman), to give
them an answer to an order of theirs, "that we could not give them any
account of the Accounts of the Navy in the years 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, as
they desire." After that I went and bespoke some linen of Betty Lane
in the Hall, and after that to the Trumpet, where I sat and talked with
her, &c. At night, it being very rainy, and it thundering and lightning
exceedingly, I took coach at the Trumpet door, taking Monsieur
L'Impertinent along with me as far as the Savoy, where he said he went
to lie with Cary Dillon,

     [Colonel Cary Dillon, a friend of the Butlers, who courted the fair
     Frances; but the engagement was subsequently broken off, see
     December 31 st, 1661.]

and is still upon the mind of going (he and his whole family) to
Ireland. Having set him down I made haste home, and in the courtyard,
it being very dark, I heard a man inquire for my house, and having asked
his business, he told me that my man William (who went this morning--out
of town to meet his aunt Blackburne) was come home not very well to his
mother, and so could not come home to-night. At which I was very sorry.
I found my wife still in pain. To bed, having not time to write letters,
and indeed having so many to write to all places that I have no heart to
go about them. Mrs. Shaw did die yesterday and her husband so sick that
he is not like to live.

5th. Lord's day. My wife being much in pain, I went this morning to Dr.
Williams (who had cured her once before of this business), in Holborn,
and he did give me an ointment which I sent home by my boy, and a
plaister which I took with me to Westminster (having called and seen my
mother in the morning as I went to the doctor), where I dined with Mr.
Sheply (my Lord dining at Kensington). After dinner to St. Margaret's,
where the first time I ever heard Common Prayer in that Church. I sat
with Mr. Hill in his pew; Mr. Hill that married in Axe Yard and that was
aboard us in the Hope. Church done I went and Mr. Sheply to see W. Howe
at Mr. Pierces, where I staid singing of songs and psalms an hour or
two, and were very pleasant with Mrs. Pierce and him. Thence to my
Lord's, where I staid and talked and drank with Mr. Sheply. After that
to Westminster stairs, where I saw a fray between Mynheer Clinke, a
Dutchman, that was at Hartlibb's wedding, and a waterman, which made
good sport. After that I got a Gravesend boat, that was come up to fetch
some bread on this side the bridge, and got them to carry me to the
bridge, and so home, where I found my wife. After prayers I to bed to
her, she having had a very bad night of it. This morning before I was up
Will came home pretty well again, he having been only weary with riding,
which he is not used to.

6th. This morning at the office, and, that being done, home to dinner
all alone, my wife being ill in pain a-bed, which I was troubled at, and
not a little impatient. After dinner to Whitehall at the Privy Seal all
the afternoon, and at night with Mr. Man to Mr. Rawlinson's in Fenchurch
Street, where we staid till eleven o'clock at night. So home and to bed,
my wife being all this day in great pain. This night Mr. Man offered me
L1000 for my office of Clerk of the Acts, which made my mouth water; but
yet I dare not take it till I speak with my Lord to have his consent.

7th. This morning to Whitehall to the Privy Seal, and took Mr. Moore and
myself and dined at my Lord's with Mr. Sheply. While I was at dinner in
come Sam. Hartlibb and his brother-in-law, now knighted by the King, to
request my promise of a ship for them to Holland, which I had promised
to get for them. After dinner to the Privy Seal all the afternoon. At
night, meeting Sam. Hartlibb, he took me by coach to Kensington, to
my Lord of Holland's; I staid in the coach while he went in about his
business. He staying long I left the coach and walked back again before
on foot (a very pleasant walk) to Kensington, where I drank and staid
very long waiting for him. At last he came, and after drinking at the
inn we went towards Westminster. Here I endeavoured to have looked out
Jane that formerly lived at Dr. Williams' at Cambridge, whom I had long
thought to live at present here, but I found myself in an error, meeting
one in the place where I expected to have found her, but she proved not
she though very like her. We went to the Bullhead, where he and I sat
and drank till 11 at night, and so home on foot. Found my wife pretty
well again, and so to bed.

8th. We met at the office, and after that to dinner at home, and
from thence with my wife by water to Catan Sterpin, with whom and her
mistress Pye we sat discoursing of Kate's marriage to Mons. Petit, her
mistress and I giving the best advice we could for her to suspend
her marriage till Mons. Petit had got some place that may be able to
maintain her, and not for him to live upon the portion that she shall
bring him. From thence to Mr. Butler's to see his daughters, the first
time that ever we made a visit to them. We found them very pretty, and
Coll. Dillon there, a very merry and witty companion, but methinks they
live in a gaudy but very poor condition. From thence, my wife and I
intending to see Mrs. Blackburne, who had been a day or two again to see
my wife, but my wife was not in condition to be seen, but she not being
at home my wife went to her mother's and I to the Privy Seal. At night
from the Privy Seal, Mr. Woodson and Mr. Jennings and I to the Sun
Tavern till it was late, and from thence to my Lord's, where my wife was
come from Mrs. Blackburne's to me, and after I had done some business
with my Lord, she and I went to Mrs. Hunt's, who would needs have us to
lie at her house to-night, she being with my wife so late at my Lord's
with us, and would not let us go home to-night. We lay there all night
very pleasantly and at ease...

9th. Left my wife at Mrs. Hunt's and I to my Lord's, and from thence
with judge Advocate Fowler, Mr. Creed, and Mr. Sheply to the Rhenish
Wine-house, and Captain Hayward of the Plymouth, who is now ordered to
carry my Lord Winchelsea, Embassador to Constantinople. We were
very merry, and judge Advocate did give Captain Hayward his Oath of
Allegiance and Supremacy. Thence to my office of Privy Seal, and, having
signed some things there, with Mr. Moore and Dean Fuller to the Leg in
King Street, and, sending for my wife, we dined there very merry, and
after dinner, parted. After dinner with my wife to Mrs. Blackburne to
visit her. She being within I left my wife there, and I to the Privy
Seal, where I despatch some business, and from thence to Mrs. Blackburne
again, who did treat my wife and me with a great deal of civility, and
did give us a fine collation of collar of beef, &c. Thence I, having
my head full of drink from having drunk so much Rhenish wine in the
morning, and more in the afternoon at Mrs. Blackburne's, came home and
so to bed, not well, and very ill all night.

10th. I had a great deal of pain all night, and a great loosing upon me
so that I could not sleep. In the morning I rose with much pain and to
the office. I went and dined at home, and after dinner with great pain
in my back I went by water to Whitehall to the Privy Seal, and that done
with Mr. Moore and Creed to Hide Park by coach, and saw a fine foot-race
three times round the Park between an Irishman and Crow, that was once
my Lord Claypoole's footman. (By the way I cannot forget that my Lord
Claypoole did the other day make enquiry of Mrs. Hunt, concerning my
House in Axe-yard, and did set her on work to get it of me for him,
which methinks is a very great change.) Crow beat the other by above two
miles. Returned from Hide Park, I went to my Lord's, and took Will (who
waited for me there) by coach and went home, taking my lute home with
me. It had been all this while since I came from sea at my Lord's for
him to play on. To bed in some pain still. For this month or two it is
not imaginable how busy my head has been, so that I have neglected to
write letters to my uncle Robert in answer to many of his, and to
other friends, nor indeed have I done anything as to my own family, and
especially this month my waiting at the Privy Seal makes me much more
unable to think of anything, because of my constant attendance there
after I have done at the Navy Office. But blessed be God for my good
chance of the Privy Seal, where I get every day I believe about L3. This
place I got by chance, and my Lord did give it me by chance, neither he
nor I thinking it to be of the worth that he and I find it to be. Never
since I was a man in the world was I ever so great a stranger to public
affairs as now I am, having not read a new book or anything like it, or
enquiring after any news, or what the Parliament do, or in any wise how
things go. Many people look after my house in Axe-yard to hire it, so
that I am troubled with them, and I have a mind to get the money to buy
goods for my house at the Navy Office, and yet I am loth to put it off
because that Mr. Man bids me L1000 for my office, which is so great a
sum that I am loth to settle myself at my new house, lest I should take
Mr. Man's offer in case I found my Lord willing to it.

11th. I rose to-day without any pain, which makes me think that my pain
yesterday was nothing but from my drinking too much the day before. To
my Lord this morning, who did give me order to get some things ready
against the afternoon for the Admiralty where he would meet. To the
Privy Seal, and from thence going to my own house in Axeyard, I went
in to Mrs. Crisp's, where I met with Mr. Hartlibb; for whom I wrote a
letter for my Lord to sign for a ship for his brother and sister, who
went away hence this day to Gravesend, and from thence to Holland. I
found by discourse with Mrs. Crisp that he is very jealous of her, for
that she is yet very kind to her old servant Meade. Hence to my Lord's
to dinner with Mr. Sheply, so to the Privy Seal; and at night home, and
then sent for the barber, and was trimmed in the kitchen, the first
time that ever I was so. I was vexed this night that W. Hewer was out of
doors till ten at night but was pretty well satisfied again when my wife
told me that he wept because I was angry, though indeed he did give me
a good reason for his being out; but I thought it a good occasion to let
him know that I do expect his being at home. So to bed.

12th. Lord's day. To my Lord, and with him to White Hall Chappell, where
Mr. Calamy preached, and made a good sermon upon these words "To whom
much is given, of him much is required." He was very officious with his
three reverences to the King, as others do. After sermon a brave anthem
of Captain Cooke's,

     [Henry Cooke, chorister of the Chapel Royal, adhered to the royal
     cause at the breaking out of the Civil Wars, and for his bravery
     obtained a captain's commission.  At the Restoration he received the
     appointment of Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal; he was an
     excellent musician, and three of his pupils turned out very
     distinguished musicians, viz, Pelham Humphrey, John Blow, and
     Michael Wise.  He was one of the original performers in the "Siege,
     of Rhodes."  He died July 13th, 1672,: and was buried in the
     cloisters of Westminster Abbey.  In another place, Pepys says, "a
     vain coxcomb he is, though he sings so well."]

which he himself sung, and the King was well pleased with it. My Lord
dined at my Lord Chamberlain's, and I at his house with Mr. Sheply.
After dinner I did give Mr. Donne; who is going to sea, the key of my
cabin and direction for the putting up of my things.

After, that I went to walk, and meeting Mrs. Lane of Westminster Hall, I
took her to my Lord's, and did give her a bottle of wine in the garden,
where Mr. Fairbrother, of Cambridge, did come and found us, and drank
with us. After that I took her to my house, where I was exceeding free
in dallying with her, and she not unfree to take it. At night home and
called at my father's, where I found Mr. Fairbrother, but I did not stay
but went homewards and called in at Mr. Rawlinson's, whither my uncle
Wight was coming and did come, but was exceeding angry (he being a
little fuddled, and I think it was that I should see him in that case)
as I never saw him in my life, which I was somewhat troubled at. Home
and to bed.

13th. A sitting day at our office. After dinner to Whitehall; to the
Privy Seal, whither my father came to me, and staid talking with me a
great while, telling me that he had propounded Mr. John Pickering for
Sir Thomas Honywood's daughter, which I think he do not deserve for his
own merit: I know not what he may do for his estate. My father and Creed
and I to the old Rhenish Winehouse, and talked and drank till night.
Then my father home, and I to my Lord's; where he told me that he would
suddenly go into the country, and so did commend the business of his sea
commission to me in his absence. After that home by coach, and took my
L100 that I had formerly left at Mr. Rawlinson's, home with me, which is
the first that ever I was master of at once. To prayers, and to bed.

14th. To the Privy Seal, and thence to my Lord's, where Mr. Pim, the
tailor, and I agreed upon making me a velvet coat. From thence to the
Privy Seal again, where Sir Samuel Morland came in with a Baronet's
grant to pass, which the King had given him to make money of. Here he
staid with me a great while; and told me the whole manner of his serving
the King in the time of the Protector; and how Thurloe's bad usage made
him to do it; how he discovered Sir R. Willis, and how he hath sunk his
fortune for the King; and that now the King hath given him a pension of
L500 per annum out of the Post Office for life, and the benefit of two
Baronets; all which do make me begin to think that he is not so much a
fool as I took him to be. Home by water to the Tower, where my father,
Mr. Fairbrother, and Cooke dined with me. After dinner in comes young
Captain Cuttance of the Speedwell, who is sent up for the gratuity given
the seamen that brought the King over. He brought me a firkin of butter
for my wife, which is very welcome. My father, after dinner, takes
leave, after I had given him 40s. for the last half year for my brother
John at Cambridge. I did also make even with Mr. Fairbrother for my
degree of Master of Arts, which cost me about L9 16s. To White Hall, and
my wife with me by water, where at the Privy Seal and elsewhere all the
afternoon. At night home with her by water, where I made good sport with
having the girl and the boy to comb my head, before I went to bed, in
the kitchen.

15th. To the office, and after dinner by water to White Hall, where
I found the King gone this morning by 5 of the clock to see a Dutch
pleasure-boat below bridge,

     [A yacht which was greatly admired, and was imitated and improved by
     Commissioner Pett, who built a yacht for the King in 1661, which was
     called the "Jenny."  Queen Elizabeth had a yacht, and one was built
     by Phineas Pett in 1604.]

where he dines, and my Lord with him. The King do tire all his people
that are about him with early rising since he came. To the office, all
the afternoon I staid there, and in the evening went to Westminster
Hall, where I staid at Mrs. Michell's, and with her and her husband
sent for some drink, and drank with them. By the same token she and
Mrs. Murford and another old woman of the Hall were going a gossiping
tonight. From thence to my Lord's, where I found him within, and he did
give me direction about his business in his absence, he intending to
go into the country to-morrow morning. Here I lay all night in the old
chamber which I had now given up to W. Howe, with whom I did intend to
lie, but he and I fell to play with one another, so that I made him to
go lie with Mr. Sheply. So I lay alone all night.

16th. This morning my Lord (all things being ready) carried me by coach
to Mr. Crew's, (in the way talking how good he did hope my place would
be to me, and in general speaking that it was not the salary of any
place that did make a man rich, but the opportunity of getting money
while he is in the place) where he took leave, and went into the coach,
and so for Hinchinbroke. My Lady Jemimah and Mr. Thomas Crew in the
coach with him. Hence to Whitehall about noon, where I met with Mr.
Madge, who took me along with him and Captain Cooke (the famous singer)
and other masters of music to dinner at an ordinary about Charing Cross
where we dined, all paying their club. Hence to the Privy Seal, where
there has been but little work these two days. In the evening home.

17th. To the office, and that done home to dinner where Mr. Unthanke,
my wife's tailor, dined with us, we having nothing but a dish of sheep's
trotters. After dinner by water to Whitehall, where a great deal of
business at the Privy Seal. At night I and Creed and the judge-Advocate
went to Mr. Pim, the tailor's, who took us to the Half Moon, and there
did give us great store of wine and anchovies, and would pay for them
all. This night I saw Mr. Creed show many the strangest emotions to
shift off his drink I ever saw in my life. By coach home and to bed.

18th. This morning I took my wife towards Westminster by water, and
landed her at Whitefriars, with L5 to buy her a petticoat, and I to
the Privy Seal. By and by comes my wife to tell me that my father has
persuaded her to buy a most fine cloth of 26s. a yard, and a rich lace,
that the petticoat will come to L5, at which I was somewhat troubled,
but she doing it very innocently, I could not be angry. I did give her
more money, and sent her away, and I and Creed and Captain Hayward (who
is now unkindly put out of the Plymouth to make way for Captain Allen to
go to Constantinople, and put into his ship the Dover, which I know will
trouble my Lord) went and dined at the Leg in King Street, where Captain
Ferrers, my Lord's Cornet, comes to us, who after dinner took me and
Creed to the Cockpitt play,

     [The Cockpit Theatre, situated in Drury Lane, was occupied as a
     playhouse in the reign of James I.  It was occupied by Davenant and
     his company in 1658, and they remained in it until November 15th,
     1660, when they removed to Salisbury Court.]

the first that I have had time to see since my coming from sea, "The
Loyall Subject," where one Kinaston, a boy, acted the Duke's sister, but
made the loveliest lady that ever I saw in my life, only her voice not
very good. After the play done, we three went to drink, and by Captain
Ferrers' means, Kinaston and another that acted Archas, the General,
came and drank with us. Hence home by coach, and after being trimmed,
leaving my wife to look after her little bitch, which was just now
a-whelping, I to bed.

19th (Lord's day). In the morning my wife tells me that the bitch has
whelped four young ones and is very well after it, my wife having had a
great fear that she would die thereof, the dog that got them being very
big. This morning Sir W. Batten, Pen, and myself, went to church to the
churchwardens, to demand a pew, which at present could not be given us,
but we are resolved to have one built. So we staid and heard Mr. Mills;'
a very, good minister. Home to dinner, where my wife had on her new
petticoat that she bought yesterday, which indeed is a very fine cloth
and a fine lace; but that being of a light colour, and the lace all
silver, it makes no great show. Mr. Creed and my brother Tom dined with
me. After dinner my wife went and fetched the little puppies to us,
which are very pretty ones. After they were gone, I went up to put my
papers in order, and finding my wife's clothes lie carelessly laid up,
I was angry with her, which I was troubled for. After that my wife and I
went and walked in the garden, and so home to bed.

20th (Office day). As Sir W. Pen and I were walking in the garden,
a messenger came to me from the Duke of York to fetch me to the Lord
Chancellor. So (Mrs. Turner with her daughter The. being come to my
house to speak with me about a friend of hers to send to sea) I went
with her in her coach as far as Worcester House, but my Lord Chancellor
being gone to the House of Lords, I went thither, and (there being a
law case before them this day) got in, and there staid all the morning,
seeing their manner of sitting on woolpacks, &c., which I never did
before.

     [It is said that these woolpacks were placed in the House of Lords
     for the judges to sit on, so that the fact that wool was a main
     source of our national wealth might be kept in the popular mind.
     The Lord Chancellor's seat is now called the Woolsack.]

After the House was up, I spoke to my Lord, and had order from him to
come to him at night. This morning Mr. Creed did give me the Papers that
concern my Lord's sea commission, which he left in my hands and went to
sea this day to look after the gratuity money.

This afternoon at the Privy Seal, where reckoning with Mr. Moore, he had
got L100 for me together, which I was glad of, guessing that the profits
of this month would come to L100.

In the evening I went all alone to drink at Mr. Harper's, where I found
Mrs. Crisp's daughter, with whom and her friends I staid and drank, and
so with W. Hewer by coach to Worcester House, where I light, sending him
home with the L100 that I received to-day. Here I staid, and saw my Lord
Chancellor come into his Great Hall, where wonderful how much company
there was to expect him at a Seal. Before he would begin any business,
he took my papers of the state of the debts of the Fleet, and there
viewed them before all the people, and did give me his advice privately
how to order things, to get as much money as we can of the Parliament.
That being done, I went home, where I found all my things come home from
sea (sent by desire by Mr. Dun), of which I was glad, though many of
my things are quite spoilt with mould by reason of lying so long a
shipboard, and my cabin being not tight. I spent much time to dispose of
them tonight, and so to bed.

21st. This morning I went to White Hall with Sir W. Pen by water, who in
our passage told me how he was bred up under Sir W. Batten. We went to
Mr. Coventry's chamber, and consulted of drawing my papers of debts of
the Navy against the afternoon for the Committee. So to the Admiralty,
where W. Hewer and I did them, and after that he went to his Aunt's
Blackburn (who has a kinswoman dead at her house to-day, and was to
be buried to-night, by which means he staid very late out). I to
Westminster Hall, where I met Mr. Crew and dined with him, where there
dined one Mr. Hickeman, an Oxford man, who spoke very much against the
height of the now old clergy, for putting out many of the religious
fellows of Colleges, and inveighing against them for their being drunk,
which, if true, I am sorry to hear. After that towards Westminster,
where I called on Mr. Pim, and there found my velvet coat (the first
that ever I had) done, and a velvet mantle, which I took to the Privy
Seal Office, and there locked them up, and went to the Queen's Court,
and there, after much waiting, spoke with Colonel Birch, who read my
papers, and desired some addition, which done I returned to the Privy
Seal, where little to do, and with Mr. Moore towards London, and in our
way meeting Monsieur Eschar (Mr. Montagu's man), about the Savoy, he
took us to the Brazennose Tavern, and there drank and so parted, and
I home by coach, and there, it being post-night, I wrote to my Lord
to give him notice that all things are well; that General Monk is made
Lieutenant of Ireland, which my Lord Roberts (made Deputy) do not like
of, to be Deputy to any man but the King himself. After that to bed.

22nd. Office, which done, Sir W. Pen took me into the garden, and there
told me how Mr. Turner do intend to petition the Duke for an allowance
extra as one of the Clerks of the Navy, which he desired me to join
with him in the furthering of, which I promised to do so that it did not
reflect upon me or to my damage to have any other added, as if I was not
able to perform my place; which he did wholly disown to be any of his
intention, but far from it. I took Mr. Hater home with me to dinner,
with whom I did advise, who did give me the same counsel. After dinner
he and I to the office about doing something more as to the debts of the
Navy than I had done yesterday, and so to Whitehall to the Privy
Seal, and having done there, with my father (who came to see me) to
Westminster Hall and the Parliament House to look for Col. Birch, but
found him not. In the House, after the Committee was up, I met with Mr.
G. Montagu, and joyed him in his entrance (this being his 3d day) for
Dover. Here he made me sit all alone in the House, none but he and I,
half an hour, discoursing how things stand, and in short he told me
how there was like to be many factions at Court between Marquis Ormond,
General Monk, and the Lord Roberts, about the business of Ireland; as
there is already between the two Houses about the Act of Indemnity; and
in the House of Commons, between the Episcopalian and Presbyterian men.
Hence to my father's (walking with Mr. Herring, the minister of St.
Bride's), and took them to the Sun Tavern, where I found George, my old
drawer, come again. From thence by water, landed them at Blackfriars,
and so home and to bed.

23rd. By water to Doctors' Commons to Dr. Walker, to give him my Lord's
papers to view over concerning his being empowered to be Vice-Admiral
under the Duke of York. There meeting with Mr. Pinkney, he and I to
a morning draft, and thence by water to White Hall, to the Parliament
House, where I spoke with Colonel Birch, and so to the Admiralty
chamber, where we and Mr. Coventry had a meeting about several
businesses. Amongst others, it was moved that Phineas Pett (kinsman to
the Commissioner) of Chatham, should be suspended his employment till
he had answered some articles put in against him, as that he should
formerly say that the King was a bastard and his mother a whore. Hence
to Westminster Hall, where I met with my father Bowyer, and Mr. Spicer,
and them I took to the Leg in King Street, and did give them a dish or
two of meat, and so away to the Privy Seal, where, the King being out
of town, we have had nothing to do these two days. To Westminster Hall,
where I met with W. Symons, T. Doling, and Mr. Booth, and with them to
the Dogg, where we eat a musk melon

     ["Melons were hardly known in England till Sir George Gardiner
     brought one from Spain, when they became in general estimation.  The
     ordinary price was five or six shillings."--Quarterly Review, vol,
     xix.]

(the first that I have eat this year), and were very merry with W.
Symons, calling him Mr. Dean, because of the Dean's lands that his uncle
had left him, which are like to be lost all. Hence home by water, and
very late at night writing letters to my Lord to Hinchinbroke, and also
to the Vice-Admiral in the Downs, and so to bed.

24th. Office, and thence with Sir William Batten and Sir William Pen to
the parish church to find out a place where to build a seat or a gallery
to sit in, and did find one which is to be done speedily. Hence with
them to dinner at a tavern in Thames Street, where they were invited to
a roasted haunch of venison and other very good victuals and company.
Hence to Whitehall to the Privy Seal, but nothing to do. At night by
land to my father's, where I found my mother not very well. I did give
her a pint of sack. My father came in, and Dr. T. Pepys, who talked with
me in French about looking out for a place for him. But I found him a
weak man, and speaks the worst French that ever I heard of one that
had been so long beyond sea. Hence into Pant's Churchyard and bought
Barkley's Argenis in Latin, and so home and to bed. I found at home that
Captain Burr had sent me 4 dozen bottles of wine today. The King came
back to Whitehall to-night.

25th. This morning Mr. Turner and I by coach from our office to
Whitehall (in our way I calling on Dr. Walker for the papers I did
give him the other day, which he had perused and found that the Duke's
counsel had abated something of the former draught which Dr. Walker drew
for my Lord) to Sir G. Carteret, where we there made up an estimate of
the debts of the Navy for the Council. At noon I took Mr. Turner and
Mr. Moore to the Leg in King Street, and did give them a dinner, and
afterward to the Sun Tavern, and did give Mr. Turner a glass of wine,
there coming to us Mr. Fowler the apothecary (the judge's son) with a
book of lute lessons which his father had left there for me, such as he
formerly did use to play when a young man, and had the use of his hand.
To the Privy Seal, and found some business now again to do there. To
Westminster Hall for a new half-shirt of Mrs. Lane, and so home by
water. Wrote letters by the post to my Lord and to sea. This night W.
Hewer brought me home from Mr. Pim's my velvet coat and cap, the first
that ever I had. So to bed.

26th (Lord's day). With Sir W. Pen to the parish church, where we are
placed in the highest pew of all, where a stranger preached a dry and
tedious long sermon. Dined at home. To church again in the afternoon
with my wife; in the garden and on the leads at night, and so to supper
and to bed.

27th. This morning comes one with a vessel of Northdown ale from Mr.
Pierce, the purser, to me, and after him another with a brave Turkey
carpet and a jar of olives from Captain Cuttance, and a pair of fine
turtle-doves from John Burr to my wife. These things came up to-day in
our smack, and my boy Ely came along with them, and came after office
was done to see me. I did give him half a crown because I saw that he
was ready to cry to see that he could not be entertained by me here. In
the afternoon to the Privy Seal, where good store of work now toward the
end of the month. From thence with Mr. Mount, Luellin, and others to the
Bull head till late, and so home, where about to o'clock Major Hart came
to me, whom I did receive with wine and anchovies, which made me so dry
that I was ill with them all night, and was fain to have the girle rise
and fetch me some drink.

28th. At home looking over my papers and books and house as to the
fitting of it to my mind till two in the afternoon. Some time I spent
this morning beginning to teach my wife some scale in music, and found
her apt beyond imagination. To the Privy Seal, where great store of work
to-day. Colonel Scroope--[Colonel Adrian Scroope, one of the persons who
sat in judgment upon Charles I.]--is this day excepted out of the Act
of Indemnity, which has been now long in coming out, but it is expected
to-morrow. I carried home L80 from the Privy Seal, by coach, and at
night spent a little more time with my wife about her music with great
content. This day I heard my poor mother had then two days been very
ill, and I fear she will not last long. To bed, a little troubled that I
fear my boy Will

     [Pepys refers to two Wills.  This was Will Wayneman; the other was
     William Hewer.]

is a thief and has stole some money of mine, particularly a letter that
Mr. Jenkins did leave the last week with me with half a crown in it to
send to his son.

29th (Office day). Before I went to the office my wife and I examined
my boy Will about his stealing of things, but he denied all with the
greatest subtlety and confidence in the world. To the office, and after
office then to the Church, where we took another view of the place where
we had resolved to build a gallery, and have set men about doing it.
Home to dinner, and there I found my wife had discovered my boy Will's
theft and a great deal more than we imagined, at which I was vexed and
intend to put him away. To my office at the Privy Seal in the afternoon,
and from thence at night to the Bull Head, with Mount, Luellin, and
others, and hence to my father's, and he being at my uncle Fenner's, I
went thither to him, and there sent for my boy's father and talked with
him about his son, and had his promise that if I will send home his boy,
he will take him notwithstanding his indenture. Home at night, and find
that my wife had found out more of the boy's stealing 6s. out of W.
Hewer's closet, and hid it in the house of office, at which my heart was
troubled. To bed, and caused the boy's clothes to be brought up to
my chamber. But after we were all a-bed, the wench (which lies in our
chamber) called us to listen of a sudden, which put my wife into such a
fright that she shook every joint of her, and a long time that I could
not get her out of it. The noise was the boy, we did believe, got in
a desperate mood out of his bed to do himself or William [Hewer] some
mischief. But the wench went down and got a candle lighted, and finding
the boy in bed, and locking the doors fast, with a candle burning all
night, we slept well, but with a great deal of fear.

30th. We found all well in the morning below stairs, bu the boy in a sad
plight of seeming sorrow; but he is the most cunning rogue that ever
I met with of his age. To White Hall, where I met with the Act of
Indemnity--[12 Car. II. cap. II, an act of free and general pardon,
indemnity, and oblivion.]--(so long talked of and hoped for), with the
Act of Rate for Pole-money, an for judicial proceedings. At Westminster
Hall I met with Mr. Paget the lawyer, and dined with him at Heaven. This
afternoon my wife went to Mr. Pierce's wife's child's christening, and
was urged to be godmother, but I advised her before-hand not to do it,
so she did not, but as proxy for my Lady Jemimah. This the first day
that ever I saw my wife wear black patches since we were married!

     [The fashion of placing black patches on the face was introduced
     towards the close of the reign of Charles I., and the practice is
     ridiculed in the "Spectator."]

My Lord came to town to-day, but coming not home till very late I staid
till 10 at night, and so home on foot. Mr. Sheply and Mr. Childe this
night at the tavern.

31st. Early to wait upon my Lord at White Hall, and with him to the
Duke's chamber. So to my office in Seething Lane. Dined at home, and
after dinner to my Lord again, who told me that he is ordered to go
suddenly to sea, and did give me some orders to be drawing up against
his going. This afternoon I agreed to let my house quite out of my hands
to Mr. Dalton (one of the wine sellers to the King, with whom I had
drunk in the old wine cellar two or three times) for L41. At night
made even at Privy Seal for this month against tomorrow to give
up possession, but we know not to whom, though we most favour Mr.
Bickerstaffe, with whom and Mr. Matthews we drank late after office was
done at the Sun, discoursing what to do about it tomorrow against Baron,
and so home and to bed. Blessed be God all things continue well with and
for me. I pray God fit me for a change of my fortune.




SEPTEMBER 1660

September 1st. This morning I took care to get a vessel to carry my
Lord's things to the Downs on Monday next, and so to White Hall to my
Lord, where he and I did look over the Commission drawn for him by the
Duke's Council, which I do not find my Lord displeased with, though
short of what Dr. Walker did formerly draw for him. Thence to the Privy
Seal to see how things went there, and I find that Mr. Baron had by
a severe warrant from the King got possession of the office from his
brother Bickerstaffe, which is very strange, and much to our admiration,
it being against all open justice. Mr. Moore and I and several others
being invited to-day by Mr. Goodman, a friend of his, we dined at the
Bullhead upon the best venison pasty that ever I eat of in my life, and
with one dish more, it was the best dinner I ever was at. Here rose
in discourse at table a dispute between Mr. Moore and Dr. Clerke, the
former affirming that it was essential to a tragedy to have the argument
of it true, which the Doctor denied, and left it to me to be judge, and
the cause to be determined next Tuesday morning at the same place, upon
the eating of the remains of the pasty, and the loser to spend 10s. All
this afternoon sending express to the fleet, to order things against my
Lord's coming and taking direction of my Lord about some rich furniture
to take along with him for the Princess!--[Mary, Princess Royal and
Princess of Orange, who died in December of this year.]--And talking
of this, I hear by Mr. Townsend, that there is the greatest preparation
against the Prince de Ligne's a coming over from the King of Spain,
that ever was in England for their Embassador. Late home, and what with
business and my boy's roguery my mind being unquiet, I went to bed.

2nd (Sunday). To Westminster, my Lord being gone before my coming to
chapel. I and Mr. Sheply told out my money, and made even for my Privy
Seal fees and gratuity money, &c., to this day between my Lord and me.
After that to chappell, where Dr. Fern, a good honest sermon upon "The
Lord is my shield." After sermon a dull anthem, and so to my Lord's (he
dining abroad) and dined with Mr. Sheply. So, to St. Margarett's, and
heard a good sermon upon the text "Teach us the old way," or something
like it, wherein he ran over all the new tenets in policy and religion,
which have brought us into all our late divisions. From church to Mrs.
Crisp's (having sent Win. Hewer home to tell my wife that I could
not come home to-night because of my Lord's going out early to-morrow
morning), where I sat late, and did give them a great deal of wine, it
being a farewell cup to Laud Crisp. I drank till the daughter began to
be very loving to me and kind, and I fear is not so good as she should
be. To my Lord's, and to bed with Mr. Sheply.

3rd. Up and to Mr.-----, the goldsmith near the new Exchange, where I
bought my wedding ring, and there, with much ado, got him to put a gold
ring to the jewell, which the King of Sweden did give my Lord: out of
which my Lord had now taken the King's picture, and intends to make a
George of it. This morning at my Lord's I had an opportunity to speak
with Sir George Downing, who has promised me to give me up my bond, and
to pay me for my last quarter while I was at sea, that so I may pay Mr.
Moore and Hawly. About noon my Lord, having taken leave of the King in
the Shield Gallery (where I saw with what kindness the King did hug my
Lord at his parting), I went over with him and saw him in his coach at
Lambeth, and there took leave of him, he going to the Downs, which put
me in mind of his first voyage that ever he made, which he did begin
like this from Lambeth. In the afternoon with Mr. Moore to my house to
cast up our Privy Seal accounts, where I found that my Lord's comes to
400 and odd pounds, and mine to L132, out of which I do give him as good
as L25 for his pains, with which I doubt he is not satisfied, but my
heart is full glad. Thence with him to Mr. Crew's, and did fetch as much
money as did make even our accounts between him and me. Home, and there
found Mr. Cooke come back from my Lord for me to get him some things
bought for him to be brought after them, a toilet cap and comb case of
silk, to make use of in Holland, for he goes to the Hague, which I can
do to-morrow morning. This day my father and my uncle Fenner, and both
his sons, have been at my house to see it, and my wife did treat them
nobly with wine and anchovies. By reason of my Lord's going to-day I
could not get the office to meet to-day.

4th. I did many things this morning at home before I went out, as
looking over the joiners, who are flooring my diningroom, and doing
business with Sir Williams

     ["Both Sir Williams" is a favourite expression with Pepys, meaning
     Sir William Batten and Sir William Penn.]

both at the office, and so to Whitehall, and so to the Bullhead, where
we had the remains of our pasty, where I did give my verdict against Mr.
Moore upon last Saturday's wager, where Dr. Fuller coming in do confirm
me in my verdict. From thence to my Lord's and despatched Mr. Cooke away
with the things to my Lord. From thence to Axe Yard to my house, where
standing at the door Mrs. Diana comes by, whom I took into my house
upstairs, and there did dally with her a great while, and found that
in Latin "Nulla puella negat." So home by water, and there sat up late
setting my papers in order, and my money also, and teaching my wife her
music lesson, in which I take great pleasure. So to bed.

5th. To the office. From thence by coach upon the desire of the
principal officers to a Master of Chancery to give Mr. Stowell his oath,
whereby he do answer that he did hear Phineas Pett say very high words
against the King a great while ago. Coming back our coach broke, and so
Stowell and I to Mr. Rawlinson's, and after a glass of wine parted, and
I to the office, home to dinner, where (having put away my boy in the
morning) his father brought him again, but I did so clear up my boy's
roguery to his father, that he could not speak against my putting him
away, and so I did give him 10s. for the boy's clothes that I made
him, and so parted and tore his indenture. All the afternoon with the
principal officers at Sir W. Batten's about Pett's business (where I
first saw Col. Slingsby, who has now his appointment for Comptroller),
but did bring it to no issue. This day I saw our Dedimus to be sworn
in the peace by, which will be shortly. In the evening my wife being a
little impatient I went along with her to buy her a necklace of pearl,
which will cost L4 10s., which I am willing to comply with her in for
her encouragement, and because I have lately got money, having now above
L200 in cash beforehand in the world. Home, and having in our way bought
a rabbit and two little lobsters, my wife and I did sup late, and so to
bed. Great news now-a-day of the Duke d'Anjou's

     [Philip, Duke of Anjou, afterwards Duke of Orleans, brother of Louis
     XIV.  (born 1640, died 1701), married the Princess Henrietta,
     youngest daughter of Charles I., who was born June 16th, 1644, at
     Exeter.  She was known as "La belle Henriette."  In May, 1670, she
     came to Dover on a political mission from Louis XIV. to her brother
     Charles II., but the visit was undertaken much against the wish of
     her husband.  Her death occurred on her return to France, and
     was attributed to poison.  It was the occasion of one of the finest
     of Bossuet's "Oraisons Funebres."]

desire to marry the Princesse Henrietta. Hugh Peters is said to be
taken,

     [Hugh Peters, born at Fowey, Cornwall, and educated at Trinity
     College, Cambridge, where he graduated M.A. 1622.  He was tried as
     one of the regicides, and executed.  A broadside, entitled "The
     Welsh Hubub, or the Unkennelling and earthing of Hugh Peters that
     crafty Fox," was printed October 3rd, 1660.]

and the Duke of Gloucester is ill, and it is said it will prove the
small-pox.

6th. To Whitehall by water with Sir W. Batten, and in our passage told
me how Commissioner Pett did pay himself for the entertainment that he
did give the King at Chatham at his coming in, and 20s. a day all the
time he was in Holland, which I wonder at, and so I see there is a great
deal of envy between the two. At Whitehall I met with Commissioner Pett,
who told me how Mr. Coventry and Fairbank his solicitor are falling out,
one complaining of the other for taking too great fees, which is too
true. I find that Commissioner Pett is under great discontent, and is
loth to give too much money for his place, and so do greatly desire me
to go along with him in what we shall agree to give Mr. Coventry, which
I have promised him, but am unwilling to mix my fortune with him that
is going down the wind. We all met this morning and afterwards at the
Admiralty, where our business is to ask provision of victuals ready for
the ships in the Downs, which we did, Mr. Gauden promising to go himself
thither and see it done. Dined Will and I at my Lord's upon a joint of
meat that I sent Mrs. Sarah for. Afterwards to my office and sent all my
books to my Lord's, in order to send them to my house that I now dwell
in. Home and to bed.

7th. Not office day, and in the afternoon at home all the day, it being
the first that I have been at home all day since I came hither. Putting
my papers, books and other things in order, and writing of letters. This
day my Lord set sail from the Downs for Holland.

8th. All day also at home. At night sent for by Sir W. Pen, with whom I
sat late drinking a glass of wine and discoursing, and I find him to be
a very sociable man, and an able man, and very cunning.

9th (Sunday). In the morning with Sir W. Pen to church, and a very good
sermon of Mr. Mills. Home to dinner, and Sir W. Pen with me to such as I
had, and it was very handsome, it being the first time that he ever saw
my wife or house since we came hither. Afternoon to church with my wife,
and after that home, and there walked with Major Hart, who came to see
me, in the garden, who tells me that we are all like to be speedily
disbanded;

     [The Trained Bands were abolished in 1663, but those of the City of
     London were specially excepted.  The officers of the Trained Bands
     were supplied by the Hon.  Artillery Company.]

and then I lose the benefit of a muster. After supper to bed.

10th (Office day). News of the Duke's intention to go tomorrow to
the fleet for a day or two to meet his sister. Col. Slingsby and I to
Whitehall, thinking to proffer our service to the Duke to wait upon him,
but meeting with Sir G. Carteret he sent us in all haste back again to
hire two Catches for the present use of the Duke. So we returned and
landed at the Bear at the Bridge foot, where we saw Southwark Fair (I
having not at all seen Bartholomew Fair), and so to the Tower wharf,
where we did hire two catches. So to the office and found Sir W. Batten
at dinner with some friends upon a good chine of beef, on which I ate
heartily, I being very hungry. Home, where Mr. Snow (whom afterwards
we called one another cozen) came to me to see me, and with him and one
Shelston, a simple fellow that looks after an employment (that was with
me just upon my going to sea last), to a tavern, where till late with
them. So home, having drunk too much, and so to bed.

11th. At Sir W. Batten's with Sir W. Pen we drank our morning draft, and
from thence for an hour in the office and dispatch a little business.
Dined at Sir W. Batten's, and by this time I see that we are like to
have a very good correspondence and neighbourhood, but chargeable. All
the afternoon at home looking over my carpenters. At night I called
Thos. Hater out of the office to my house to sit and talk with me. After
he was gone I caused the girl to wash the wainscot of our parlour,
which she did very well, which caused my wife and I good sport. Up to
my chamber to read a little, and wrote my Diary for three or four days
past. The Duke of York did go to-day by break of day to the Downs. The
Duke of Gloucester ill. The House of Parliament was to adjourn to-day. I
know not yet whether it be done or no. To bed.

12th (Office day). This noon I expected to have had my cousin Snow and
my father come to dine with me, but it being very rainy they did not
come. My brother Tom came to my house with a letter from my brother
John, wherein he desires some books: Barthol. Anatom., Rosin. Rom.
Antiq., and Gassend. Astronom., the last of which I did give him, and an
angel--[A gold coin varying in value at different times from 6s. 8d. to
10s.]--against my father buying of the others. At home all the afternoon
looking after my workmen, whose laziness do much trouble me. This day
the Parliament adjourned.

13th. Old East comes to me in the morning with letters, and I did give
him a bottle of Northdown ale, which made the poor man almost drunk. In
the afternoon my wife went to the burial of a child of my cozen Scott's,
and it is observable that within this month my Aunt Wight was brought to
bed of two girls, my cozen Stradwick of a girl and a boy, and my cozen
Scott of a boy, and all died. In the afternoon to Westminster, where Mr.
Dalton was ready with his money to pay me for my house, but our writings
not being drawn it could not be done to-day. I met with Mr. Hawly, who
was removing his things from Mr. Bowyer's, where he has lodged a great
while, and I took him and W. Bowyer to the Swan and drank, and Mr.
Hawly did give me a little black rattoon,--[Probably an Indian rattan
cane.]--painted and gilt. Home by water. This day the Duke of Gloucester
died of the small-pox, by the great negligence of the doctors.

14th (Office day). I got L42 15s. appointed me by bill for my employment
of Secretary to the 4th of this month, it being the last money I shall
receive upon that score. My wife went this afternoon to see my mother,
who I hear is very ill, at which my heart is very sad. In the afternoon
Luellin comes to my house, and takes me out to the Mitre in Wood Street,
where Mr. Samford, W. Symons and his wife, and Mr. Scobell, Mr. Mount
and Chetwind, where they were very merry, Luellin being drunk, and I
being to defend the ladies from his kissing them, I kissed them myself
very often with a great deal of mirth. Parted very late, they by coach
to Westminster, and I on foot.

15th. Met very early at our office this morning to pick out the
twenty-five ships which are to be first paid off: After that to
Westminster and dined with Mr. Dalton at his office, where we had one
great court dish, but our papers not being done we could [not] make an
end of our business till Monday next. Mr. Dalton and I over the water to
our landlord Vanly, with whom we agree as to Dalton becoming a tenant.
Back to Westminster, where I met with Dr. Castles, who chidd me for some
errors in our Privy-Seal business; among the rest, for letting the fees
of the six judges pass unpaid, which I know not what to say to, till I
speak to Mr. Moore. I was much troubled, for fear of being forced to pay
the money myself. Called at my father's going home, and bespoke mourning
for myself, for the death of the Duke of Gloucester. I found my mother
pretty well. So home and to bed.

16th (Sunday). To Dr. Hardy's church, and sat with Mr. Rawlinson and
heard a good sermon upon the occasion of the Duke's death. His text was,
"And is there any evil in the city and the Lord hath not done it?" Home
to dinner, having some sport with Win. [Hewer], who never had been at
Common Prayer before. After dinner I alone to Westminster, where I spent
my time walking up and down in Westminster Abbey till sermon time with
Ben. Palmer and Fetters the watchmaker, who told me that my Lord of
Oxford is also dead of the small-pox; in whom his family dies, after 600
years having that honour in their family and name. From thence to the
Park, where I saw how far they had proceeded in the Pell-mell, and in
making a river through the Park, which I had never seen before since it
was begun.

     [This is the Mall in St. James's Park, which was made by Charles
     II., the former Mall (Pall Mall) having been built upon during the
     Commonwealth.  Charles II. also formed the canal by throwing the
     several small ponds into one.]

Thence to White Hall garden, where I saw the King in purple mourning for
his brother.

     ["The Queen-mother of France," says Ward, in his Diary, p. 177,
     "died at Agrippina, 1642, and her son Louis, 1643, for whom King
     Charles mourned in Oxford in purple, which is Prince's mourning."]

So home, and in my way met with Dinah, who spoke to me and told me she
had a desire to speak too about some business when I came to Westminster
again. Which she spoke in such a manner that I was afraid she might tell
me something that I would not hear of our last meeting at my house at
Westminster. Home late, being very dark. A gentleman in the Poultry had
a great and dirty fall over a waterpipe that lay along the channel.

17th. Office very early about casting up the debts of those twenty-five
ships which are to be paid off, which we are to present to the Committee
of Parliament. I did give my wife L15 this morning to go to buy mourning
things for her and me, which she did. Dined at home and Mr. Moore with
me, and afterwards to Whitehall to Mr. Dalton and drank in the Cellar,
where Mr. Vanly according to appointment was. Thence forth to see the
Prince de Ligne, Spanish Embassador, come in to his audience, which was
done in very great state. That being done, Dalton, Vanly, Scrivener
and some friends of theirs and I to the Axe, and signed and sealed our
writings, and hence to the Wine cellar again, where I received L41 for
my interest in my house, out of which I paid my Landlord to Michaelmas
next, and so all is even between him and me, and I freed of my poor
little house. Home by link with my money under my arm. So to bed after
I had looked over the things my wife had bought to-day, with which
being not very well pleased, they costing too much, I went to bed in a
discontent. Nothing yet from sea, where my Lord and the Princess are.

18th. At home all the morning looking over my workmen in my house. After
dinner Sir W. Batten, Pen, and myself by coach to Westminster Hall,
where we met Mr. Wayte the lawyer to the Treasurer, and so we went up to
the Committee of Parliament, which are to consider of the debts of the
Army and Navy, and did give in our account of the twenty-five ships.
Col. Birch was very impertinent and troublesome. But at last we did
agree to fit the accounts of our ships more perfectly for their view
within a few days, that they might see what a trouble it is to do what
they desire. From thence Sir Williams both going by water home, I took
Mr. Wayte to the Rhenish winehouse, and drank with him and so parted.
Thence to Mr. Crew's and spoke with Mr. Moore about the business of
paying off Baron our share of the dividend. So on foot home, by the way
buying a hat band and other things for my mourning to-morrow. So home
and to bed. This day I heard that the Duke of York, upon the news of the
death of his brother yesterday, came hither by post last night.

19th (Office day). I put on my mourning and went to the office. At noon
thinking to have found my wife in hers, I found that the tailor had
failed her, at which I was vexed because of an invitation that we have
to a dinner this day, but after having waited till past one o'clock I
went, and left her to put on some other clothes and come after me to the
Mitre tavern in Wood-street (a house of the greatest note in London),
where I met W. Symons, and D. Scobell, and their wives, Mr. Samford,
Luellin, Chetwind, one Mr. Vivion, and Mr. White,

     [According to Noble, Jeremiah White married Lady Frances Cromwell's
     waiting-woman, in Oliver's lifetime, and they lived together fifty
     years.  Lady Frances had two husbands, Mr. Robert Rich and Sir John
     Russell of Chippenham, the last of whom she survived fifty-two years
     dying 1721-22 The story is, that Oliver found White on his knees to
     Frances Cromwell, and that, to save himself, he pretended to have
     been soliciting her interest with her waiting-woman, whom Oliver
     compelled him to marry.  (Noble's "Life of Cromwell," vol. ii.
     pp. 151, 152.) White was born in 1629 and died 1707.]

formerly chaplin to the Lady Protectresse--[Elizabeth, wife of Oliver
Cromwell.]--(and still so, and one they say that is likely to get my
Lady Francess for his wife). Here we were very merry and had a very good
dinner, my wife coming after me hither to us.

Among other pleasures some of us fell to handycapp,

     ["A game at cards not unlike Loo, but with this difference, the
     winner of one trick has to put in a double stake, the winner of two
     tricks a triple stake, and so on.  Thus, if six persons are playing,
     and the general stake is 1s., suppose A gains the three tricks, he
     gains 6s., and has to 'hand i' the cap,' or pool, 4s.  for the next
     deal.  Suppose A gains two tricks and B one, then A gains 4s. and B
     2s., and A has to stake 3s. and B 2s. for the next deal."--Hindley's
     Tavern Anecdotes.--M. B.]

a sport that I never knew before, which was very good. We staid till
it was very late; it rained sadly, but we made shift to get coaches. So
home and to bed.

20th. At home, and at the office, and in the garden walking with both
Sir Williams all the morning. After dinner to Whitehall to Mr. Dalton,
and with him to my house and took away all my papers that were left in
my closet, and so I have now nothing more in the house or to do with
it. We called to speak with my Landlord Beale, but he was not within but
spoke with the old woman, who takes it very ill that I did not let her
have it, but I did give her an answer. From thence to Sir G. Downing and
staid late there (he having sent for me to come to him), which was to
tell me how my Lord Sandwich had disappointed him of a ship to bring
over his child and goods, and made great complaint thereof; but I got
him to write a letter to Lawson, which it may be may do the business for
him, I writing another also about it. While he was writing, and his Lady
and I had a great deal of discourse in praise of Holland. By water to
the Bridge, and so to Major Hart's lodgings in Cannon-street, who used
me very kindly with wine and good discourse, particularly upon the ill
method which Colonel Birch and the Committee use in defending of the
army and the navy; promising the Parliament to save them a great deal
of money, when we judge that it will cost the King more than if they had
nothing to do with it, by reason of their delays and scrupulous enquirys
into the account of both. So home and to bed.

21st (Office day). There all the morning and afternoon till 4 o'clock.
Hence to Whitehall, thinking to have put up my books at my Lord's, but
am disappointed from want of a chest which I had at Mr. Bowyer's. Back
by water about 8 o'clock, and upon the water saw the corpse of the Duke
of Gloucester brought down Somerset House stairs, to go by water to
Westminster, to be buried to-night. I landed at the old Swan and went to
the Hoop Tavern, and (by a former agreement) sent for Mr. Chaplin, who
with Nicholas Osborne and one Daniel came to us and we drank off two
or three quarts of wine, which was very good; the drawing of our wine
causing a great quarrel in the house between the two drawers which
should draw us the best, which caused a great deal of noise and falling
out till the master parted them, and came up to us and did give us a
large account of the liberty that he gives his servants, all alike, to
draw what wine they will to please his customers; and we did eat above
200 walnuts. About to o'clock we broke up and so home, and in my way I
called in with them at Mr. Chaplin's, where Nicholas Osborne did give me
a barrel of samphire,

     [Samphire was formerly a favourite pickle; hence the "dangerous
     trade" of the samphire gatherer ("King Lear," act iv.  sc. 6) who
     supplied the demand.  It was sold in the streets, and one of the old
     London cries was "I ha' Rock Samphier, Rock Samphier!"]

and showed me the keys of Mardyke Fort,

     [A fort four miles east of Dunkirk, probably dismantled when that
     town was sold to Louis XIV.]

which he that was commander of the fort sent him as a token when the
fort was demolished, which I was mightily pleased to see, and will get
them of him if I can. Home, where I found my boy (my maid's brother)
come out of the country to-day, but was gone to bed and so I could not
see him to-night. To bed.

22nd. This morning I called up my boy, and found him a pretty,
well-looked boy, and one that I think will please me. I went this
morning by land to Westminster along with Luellin, who came to my house
this morning to get me to go with him to Capt. Allen to speak with him
for his brother to go with him to Constantinople, but could not find
him. We walked on to Fleet street, where at Mr. Standing's in Salsbury
Court we drank our morning draft and had a pickled herring. Among other
discourse here he told me how the pretty woman that I always loved at
the beginning of Cheapside that sells child's coats was served by the
Lady Bennett (a famous strumpet), who by counterfeiting to fall into a
swoon upon the sight of her in her shop, became acquainted with her, and
at last got her ends of her to lie with a gentleman that had hired her
to procure this poor soul for him. To Westminster to my Lord's, and
there in the house of office vomited up all my breakfast, my stomach
being ill all this day by reason of the last night's debauch. Here I
sent to Mr. Bowyer's for my chest and put up my books and sent them
home. I staid here all day in my Lord's chamber and upon the leads
gazing upon Diana, who looked out of a window upon me. At last I went
out to Mr. Harper's, and she standing over the way at the gate, I went
over to her and appointed to meet to-morrow in the afternoon at my
Lord's. Here I bought a hanging jack. From thence by coach home by the
way at the New Exchange

     [In the Strand; built, under the auspices of James I., in 1608, out
     of the stables of Durham House, the site of the present Adelphi.
     The New Exchange stood where Coutts's banking-house now is.  "It was
     built somewhat on the model of the Royal Exchange, with cellars
     beneath, a walk above, and rows of shops over that, filled chiefly
     with milliners, sempstresses, and the like."  It was also called
     "Britain's Burse."  "He has a lodging in the Strand... to
     watch when ladies are gone to the china houses, or to the Exchange,
     that he may meet them by chance and give them presents, some two or
     three hundred pounds worth of toys, to be laughed at"--Ben Jonson,
     The Silent Woman, act i.  sc. 1.]

I bought a pair of short black stockings, to wear over a pair of silk
ones for mourning; and here I met with The. Turner and Joyce, buying of
things to go into mourning too for the Duke, (which is now the mode
of all the ladies in town), where I wrote some letters by the post to
Hinchinbroke to let them know that this day Mr. Edw. Pickering is come
from my Lord, and says that he left him well in Holland, and that he
will be here within three or four days. To-day not well of my last
night's drinking yet. I had the boy up to-night for his sister to teach
him to put me to bed, and I heard him read, which he did pretty well.

23rd (Lord's day). My wife got up to put on her mourning to-day and to
go to Church this morning. I up and set down my journall for these 5
days past. This morning came one from my father's with a black cloth
coat, made of my short cloak, to walk up and down in. To church my
wife and I, with Sir W. Batten, where we heard of Mr. Mills a very good
sermon upon these words, "So run that ye may obtain." After dinner all
alone to Westminster. At Whitehall I met with Mr. Pierce and his wife
(she newly come forth after childbirth) both in mourning for the Duke of
Gloucester. She went with Mr. Child to Whitehall chapel and Mr. Pierce
with me to the Abbey, where I expected to hear Mr. Baxter or Mr. Rowe
preach their farewell sermon, and in Mr. Symons's pew I sat and heard
Mr. Rowe. Before sermon I laughed at the reader, who in his prayer
desires of God that He would imprint his word on the thumbs of our right
hands and on the right great toes of our right feet. In the midst of the
sermon some plaster fell from the top of the Abbey, that made me and all
the rest in our pew afeard, and I wished myself out. After sermon with
Mr. Pierce to Whitehall, and from thence to my Lord, but Diana did not
come according to our agreement. So calling at my father's (where
my wife had been this afternoon but was gone home) I went home. This
afternoon, the King having news of the Princess being come to Margate,
he and the Duke of York went down thither in barges to her.

24th (Office day). From thence to dinner by coach with my wife to my
Cozen Scott's, and the company not being come, I went over the way to
the Barber's. So thither again to dinner, where was my uncle Fenner and
my aunt, my father and mother, and others. Among the rest my Cozen Rich.
Pepys,

     [Richard Pepys, eldest son of Richard Pepys, Lord Chief Justice of
     Ireland.  He went to Boston, Mass., in 1634, and returned to England
     about 1646.]

their elder brother, whom I had not seen these fourteen years, ever
since he came from New England. It was strange for us to go a gossiping
to her, she having newly buried her child that she was brought to
bed of. I rose from table and went to the Temple church, where I had
appointed Sir W. Batten to meet him; and there at Sir Heneage Finch
Sollicitor General's chambers, before him and Sir W. Wilde,

     [William Wilde, elected Recorder on November 3rd, 1659, and
     appointed one of the commissioners sent to Breda to desire Charles
     II.  to return to England immediately.  He was knighted after the
     King's return, called to the degree of Serjeant, and created a
     baronet, all in the same year.  In 1668 he ceased to be Recorder,
     and was appointed judge of the Court of Common Pleas.  In 1673 he
     was removed to the King's Bench.  He was turned out of his office in
     1679 on account of his action in connection with the Popish Plot,
     and died November 23rd of the same year.]

Recorder of London (whom we sent for from his chamber) we were sworn
justices of peace for Middlesex, Essex, Kent, and Southampton; with
which honour I did find myself mightily pleased, though I am wholly
ignorant in the duty of a justice of peace. From thence with Sir William
to Whitehall by water (old Mr. Smith with us) intending to speak with
Secretary Nicholas about the augmentation of our salaries, but being
forth we went to the Three Tuns tavern, where we drank awhile, and then
came in Col. Slingsby and another gentleman and sat with us. From thence
to my Lord's to enquire whether they have had any thing from my Lord
or no. Knocking at the door, there passed me Mons. L'Impertinent [Mr.
Butler] for whom I took a coach and went with him to a dancing meeting
in Broad Street, at the house that was formerly the glass-house, Luke
Channel, Master of the School, where I saw good dancing, but it growing
late, and the room very full of people and so very hot, I went home.

25th. To the office, where Sir W. Batten, Colonel Slingsby, and I sat
awhile, and Sir R. Ford

     [Sir Richard Ford was one of the commissioners sent to Breda to
     desire Charles II.  to return to England immediately.]

coming to us about some business, we talked together of the interest
of this kingdom to have a peace with Spain and a war with France
and Holland; where Sir R. Ford talked like a man of great reason and
experience. And afterwards I did send for a cup of tee'

     [That excellent and by all Physicians, approved, China drink, called
     by the Chineans Tcha, by other nations Tay alias Tee, is sold at the
     Sultaness Head Coffee-House, in Sweetings Rents, by the "Royal
     Exchange, London."  "Coffee, chocolate, and a kind of drink called
     tee, sold in almost every street in 1659."--Rugge's Diurnal.  It is
     stated in "Boyne's Trade Tokens," ed. Williamson, vol. i., 1889,
     p. 593 "that the word tea occurs on no other tokens than those
     issued from 'the Great Turk' (Morat ye Great) coffeehouse in
     Exchange Alley.  The Dutch East India Company introduced tea into
     Europe in 1610, and it is said to have been first imported into
     England from Holland about 1650.  The English "East India Company"
     purchased and presented 2 lbs. of tea to Charles II. in 1660, and 23
     lbs. in 1666.  The first order for its importation by the company
     was in 1668, and the first consignment of it, amounting to 143 lbs.,
     was received from Bantam in 1669 (see Sir George Birdwood's "Report
     on the Old Records at the India Office," 1890, p. 26).  By act 12
     Car.  II., capp.  23, 24, a duty of 8d. per gallon was imposed upon
     the infusion of tea, as well as on chocolate and sherbet.]

(a China drink) of which I never had drank before, and went away. Then
came Col. Birch and Sir R. Browne by a former appointment, and with
them from Tower wharf in the barge belonging to our office we went to
Deptford to pay off the ship Success, which (Sir G. Carteret and Sir W.
Pen coming afterwards to us) we did, Col. Birch being a mighty busy man
and one that is the most indefatigable and forward to make himself work
of any man that ever I knew in my life. At the Globe we had a very
good dinner, and after that to the pay again, which being finished we
returned by water again, and I from our office with Col. Slingsby by
coach to Westminster (I setting him down at his lodgings by the way) to
inquire for my Lord's coming thither (the King and the Princess

     ["The Princess Royall came from Gravesend to Whitehall by water,
     attended by a noble retinue of about one hundred persons, gentry,
     and servants, and tradesmen, and tirewomen, and others, that took
     that opportunity to advance their fortunes, by coming in with so
     excellent a Princess as without question she is."-Rugge's Diurnal.
     A broadside, entitled "Ourania, the High and Mighty Lady the
     Princess Royal of Aurange, congratulated on her most happy arrival,
     September the 25th, 1660," was printed on the 29th.]

coming up the river this afternoon as we were at our pay), and I found
him gone to Mr. Crew's, where I found him well, only had got some corns
upon his foot which was not well yet. My Lord told me how the ship that
brought the Princess and him (The Tredagh) did knock six times upon the
Kentish Knock,

     [A shoal in the North Sea, off the Thames mouth, outside the Long
     Sand, fifteen miles N.N.E. of the North Foreland.  It measures seven
     miles north-eastward, and about two miles in breadth.  It is partly
     dry at low water.  A revolving light was set up in 1840.]

which put them in great fear for the ship; but got off well. He told
me also how the King had knighted Vice-Admiral Lawson and Sir Richard
Stayner. From him late and by coach home, where the plasterers being at
work in all the rooms in my house, my wife was fain to make a bed upon
the ground for her and me, and so there we lay all night.

26th. Office day. That done to the church, to consult about our gallery.
So home to dinner, where I found Mrs. Hunt, who brought me a letter for
me to get my Lord to sign for her husband, which I shall do for her. At
home with the workmen all the afternoon, our house being in a most sad
pickle. In the evening to the office, where I fell a-reading of Speed's
Geography for a while. So home thinking to have found Will at home, but
he not being come home but gone somewhere else I was very angry, and
when he came did give him a very great check for it, and so I went to
bed.

27th. To my Lord at Mr. Crew's, and there took order about some business
of his, and from thence home to my workmen all the afternoon. In the
evening to my Lord's, and there did read over with him and Dr. Walker
my lord's new commission for sea, and advised thereupon how to have it
drawn. So home and to bed.

28th (Office day). This morning Sir W. Batten and Col. Slingsby went
with Col. Birch and Sir Wm. Doyly to Chatham to pay off a ship there.
So only Sir W. Pen and I left here in town. All the afternoon among my
workmen till 10 or 11 at night, and did give them drink and very merry
with them, it being my luck to meet with a sort of drolling workmen on
all occasions. To bed.

29th. All day at home to make an end of our dirty work of the
plasterers, and indeed my kitchen is now so handsome that I did not
repent of all the trouble that I have been put to, to have it done. This
day or yesterday, I hear, Prince Rupert

     [This is the first mention in the Diary of this famous prince, third
     son of Frederick, Prince Palatine of the Rhine, and Elizabeth,
     daughter of James I., born December 17th, 1619.  He died at his
     house in Spring Gardens, November 29th, 1682.]

is come to Court; but welcome to nobody.

30th (Lord's day). To our Parish church both forenoon and afternoon all
alone. At night went to bed without prayers, my house being every where
foul above stairs.




OCTOBER 1660

October 1st. Early to my Lord to Whitehall, and there he did give me
some work to do for him, and so with all haste to the office. Dined at
home, and my father by chance with me. After dinner he and I advised
about hangings for my rooms, which are now almost fit to be hung, the
painters beginning to do their work to-day. After dinner he and I to the
Miter, where with my uncle Wight (whom my father fetched thither), while
I drank a glass of wine privately with Mr. Mansell, a poor Reformado of
the Charles, who came to see me. Here we staid and drank three or four
pints of wine and so parted. I home to look after my workmen, and at
night to bed. The Commissioners are very busy disbanding of the army,
which they say do cause great robbing. My layings out upon my house an
furniture are so great that I fear I shall not be able to go through
them without breaking one of my bags of L100, I having but L200 yet in
the world.

2nd. With Sir Wm. Pen by water to Whitehall, being this morning visited
before I went out by my brother Tom, who told me that for his lying out
of doors a day and a night my father had forbade him to come any more
into his house, at which I was troubled, and did soundly chide him for
doing so, and upon confessing his fault I told him I would speak to my
father. At Whitehall I met with Captain Clerk, and took him to the Leg
in King Street, and did give him a dish or two of meat, and his purser
that was with him, for his old kindness to me on board. After dinner I
to Whitehall, where I met with Mrs. Hunt, and was forced to wait upon
Mr. Scawen at a committee to speak for her husband, which I did. After
that met with Luellin, Mr. Fage, and took them both to the Dog, and did
give them a glass of wine. After that at Will's I met with Mr. Spicer,
and with him to the Abbey to see them at vespers. There I found but a
thin congregation already. So I see that religion, be it what it will,
is but a humour,

     [The four humours of the body described by the old physicians were
     supposed to exert their influence upon the mind, and in course of
     time the mind as well as the body was credited with its own
     particular humours.  The modern restricted use of the word humour
     did not become general until the eighteenth century.]

and so the esteem of it passeth as other things do. From thence with him
to see Robin Shaw, who has been a long time ill, and I have not seen
him since I came from sea. He is much changed, but in hopes to be well
again. From thence by coach to my father's, and discoursed with him
about Tom, and did give my advice to take him home again, which I think
he will do in prudence rather than put him upon learning the way of
being worse. So home, and from home to Major Hart, who is just going
out of town to-morrow, and made much of me, and did give me the oaths of
supremacy and allegiance, that I may be capable of my arrears. So home
again, where my wife tells me what she has bought to-day, namely, a bed
and furniture for her chamber, with which very well pleased I went to
bed.

3d. With Sir W. Batten and Pen by water to White Hall, where a meeting
of the Dukes of York and Albemarle, my Lord Sandwich and all the
principal officers, about the Winter Guard, but we determined of
nothing. To my Lord's, who sent a great iron chest to White Hall; and
I saw it carried, into the King's closet, where I saw most incomparable
pictures. Among the rest a book open upon a desk, which I durst have
sworn was a reall book, and back again to my Lord, and dined all alone
with him, who do treat me with a great deal of respect; and after dinner
did discourse an hour with me, and advise about some way to get himself
some money to make up for all his great expenses, saying that he
believed that he might have any thing that he would ask of the King.
This day Mr. Sheply and all my Lord's goods came from sea, some of them
laid of the Wardrobe and some brought to my Lord's house. From thence
to our office, where we met and did business, and so home and spent the
evening looking upon the painters that are at work in my house. This day
I heard the Duke speak of a great design that he and my Lord of Pembroke
have, and a great many others, of sending a venture to some parts of
Africa to dig for gold ore there. They intend to admit as many as will
venture their money, and so make themselves a company. L250 is the
lowest share for every man. But I do not find that my Lord do much like
it. At night Dr. Fairbrother (for so he is lately made of the Civil Law)
brought home my wife by coach, it being rainy weather, she having been
abroad today to buy more furniture for her house.

4th. This morning I was busy looking over papers at the office all
alone, and being visited by Lieut. Lambert of the Charles (to whom I was
formerly much beholden), I took him along with me to a little alehouse
hard by our office, whither my cozen Thomas Pepys the turner had sent
for me to show me two gentlemen that had a great desire to be known to
me, one his name is Pepys, of our family, but one that I never heard of
before, and the other a younger son of Sir Tho. Bendishes, and so we
all called cozens. After sitting awhile and drinking, my two new cozens,
myself, and Lieut. Lambert went by water to Whitehall, and from thence
I and Lieut. Lambert to Westminster Abbey, where we saw Dr. Frewen
translated to the Archbishoprick of York. Here I saw the Bishops of
Winchester, Bangor, Rochester, Bath and Wells, and Salisbury, all in
their habits, in King Henry Seventh's chappell. But, Lord! at their
going out, how people did most of them look upon them as strange
creatures, and few with any kind of love or respect. From thence at 2
to my Lord's, where we took Mr. Sheply and Wm. Howe to the Raindeer, and
had some oysters, which were very good, the first I have eat this year.
So back to my Lord's to dinner, and after dinner Lieut. Lambert and I
did look upon my Lord's model, and he told me many things in a ship that
I desired to understand. From thence by water I (leaving Lieut. Lambert
at Blackfriars) went home, and there by promise met with Robert Shaw and
Jack Spicer, who came to see me, and by the way I met upon Tower Hill
with Mr. Pierce the surgeon and his wife, and took them home and did
give them good wine, ale, and anchovies, and staid them till night,
and so adieu. Then to look upon my painters that are now at work in my
house. At night to bed.

5th. Office day; dined at home, and all the afternoon at home to see my
painters make an end of their work, which they did to-day to my content,
and I am in great joy to see my house likely once again to be clean. At
night to bed.

6th. Col. Slingsby and I at the office getting a catch ready for the
Prince de Ligne to carry his things away to-day, who is now going home
again. About noon comes my cozen H. Alcock, for whom I brought a letter
for my Lord to sign to my Lord Broghill for some preferment in Ireland,
whither he is now a-going. After him comes Mr. Creed, who brought me
some books from Holland with him, well bound and good books, which I
thought he did intend to give me, but I found that I must pay him. He
dined with me at my house, and from thence to Whitehall together, where
I was to give my Lord an account of the stations and victualls of the
fleet in order to the choosing of a fleet fit for him to take to sea,
to bring over the Queen, but my Lord not coming in before 9 at night I
staid no longer for him, but went back again home and so to bed.

7th (Lord's day). To White Hall on foot, calling at my father's to
change my long black cloak for a short one (long cloaks being now quite
out); but he being gone to church, I could not get one, and therefore
I proceeded on and came to my Lord before he went to chapel and so went
with him, where I heard Dr. Spurstow preach before the King a poor dry
sermon; but a very good anthem of Captn. Cooke's afterwards. Going out
of chapel I met with Jack Cole, my old friend (whom I had not seen a
great while before), and have promised to renew acquaintance in London
together. To my Lord's and dined with him; he all dinner time talking
French to me, and telling me the story how the Duke of York hath got my
Lord Chancellor's daughter with child,

     [Anne Hyde, born March 12th, 1637, daughter of Edward, first Earl of
     Clarendon.  She was attached to the court of the Princess of Orange,
     daughter of Charles I., 1654, and contracted to James, Duke of York,
     at Breda, November 24th, 1659.  The marriage was avowed in London
     September 3rd, 1660.  She joined the Church of Rome in 1669, and
     died March 31st, 1671.]

and that she, do lay it to him, and that for certain he did promise her
marriage, and had signed it with his blood, but that he by stealth had
got the paper out of her cabinet. And that the King would have him to
marry her, but that he will not.

     [The Duke of York married Anne Hyde, and he avowed the marriage
     September 3rd, so that Pepys was rather behindhand in his
     information.]

So that the thing is very bad for the Duke, and them all; but my Lord do
make light of it, as a thing that he believes is not a new thing for the
Duke to do abroad. Discoursing concerning what if the Duke should marry
her, my Lord told me that among his father's many old sayings that he
had wrote in a book of his, this is one--that he that do get a wench
with child and marry her afterwards is as if a man should----in his hat
and then clap it on his head. I perceive my Lord is grown a man very
indifferent in all matters of religion, and so makes nothing of
these things. After dinner to the Abbey, where I heard them read the
church-service, but very ridiculously, that indeed I do not in myself
like it at all. A poor cold sermon of Dr. Lamb's, one of the prebends,
in his habit, came afterwards, and so all ended, and by my troth a
pitiful sorry devotion that these men pay. So walked home by land, and
before supper I read part of the Marian persecution in Mr. Fuller. So to
supper, prayers, and to bed.

8th. Office day, and my wife being gone out to buy some household stuff,
I dined all alone, and after dinner to Westminster, in my way meeting
Mr. Moore coming to me, who went back again with me calling at several
places about business, at my father's about gilded leather for my
dining room, at Mr. Crew's about money, at my Lord's about the same, but
meeting not Mr. Sheply there I went home by water, and Mr. Moore with
me, who staid and supped with me till almost 9 at night. We love one
another's discourse so that we cannot part when we do meet. He tells me
that the profit of the Privy Seal is much fallen, for which I am very
sorry. He gone and I to bed.

9th. This morning Sir W. Batten with Colonel Birch to Deptford, to pay
off two ships. Sir W. Pen and I staid to do business, and afterwards
together to White Hall, where I went to my Lord, and found him in bed
not well, and saw in his chamber his picture,--[Lord Sandwich's portrait
by Lely, see post, 22nd of this same month.]--very well done; and am
with child

     [A figurative expression for an eager longing desire, used by Udall
     and by Spenser.  The latest authority given by Dr. Murray in the
     "New English Dictionary," is Bailey in 1725.]

till I get it copied out, which I hope to do when he is gone to sea. To
Whitehall again, where at Mr. Coventry's chamber I met with Sir W. Pen
again, and so with him to Redriffe by water, and from thence walked
over the fields to Deptford (the first pleasant walk I have had a great
while), and in our way had a great deal of merry discourse, and find
him to be a merry fellow and pretty good natured, and sings very bawdy
songs. So we came and found our gentlemen and Mr. Prin at the pay. About
noon we dined together, and were very merry at table telling of tales.
After dinner to the pay of another ship till 10 at night, and so home in
our barge, a clear moonshine night, and it was 12 o'clock before we got
home, where I found my wife in bed, and part of our chambers hung to-day
by the upholster, but not being well done I was fretted, and so in a
discontent to bed. I found Mr. Prin a good, honest, plain man, but in
his discourse not very free or pleasant. Among all the tales that passed
among us to-day, he told us of one Damford, that, being a black man, did
scald his beard with mince-pie, and it came up again all white in that
place, and continued to his dying day. Sir W. Pen told us a good jest
about some gentlemen blinding of the drawer, and who he catched was to
pay the reckoning, and so they got away, and the master of the house
coming up to see what his man did, his man got hold of him, thinking
it to be one of the gentlemen, and told him that he was to pay the
reckoning.

10th. Office day all the morning. In the afternoon with the upholster
seeing him do things to my mind, and to my content he did fit my chamber
and my wife's. At night comes Mr. Moore, and staid late with me to tell
me how Sir Hards. Waller--[Sir Hardress Waller, Knt., one of Charles I.
judges. His sentence was commuted to imprisonment for life.]--(who only
pleads guilty), Scott, Coke, Peters, Harrison,

     [General Thomas Harrison, son of a butcher at Newcastle-under-Lyme,
     appointed by Cromwell to convey Charles I.  from Windsor to
     Whitehall, in order to his trial.  He signed the warrant for the
     execution of the King.  He was hanged, drawn, and quartered on the
     13th.]

&c. were this day arraigned at the bar at the Sessions House, there
being upon the bench the Lord Mayor, General Monk, my Lord of Sandwich,
&c.; such a bench of noblemen as had not been ever seen in England! They
all seem to be dismayed, and will all be condemned without question. In
Sir Orlando Bridgman's charge, he did wholly rip up the unjustness of
the war against the King from the beginning, and so it much reflects
upon all the Long Parliament, though the King had pardoned them, yet
they must hereby confess that the King do look upon them as traitors.
To-morrow they are to plead what they have to say. At night to bed.

11th. In the morning to my Lord's, where I met with Mr. Creed, and with
him and Mr. Blackburne to the Rhenish wine house, where we sat drinking
of healths a great while, a thing which Mr. Blackburne formerly would
not upon any terms have done. After we had done there Mr. Creed and I to
the Leg in King Street, to dinner, where he and I and my Will had a good
udder to dinner, and from thence to walk in St. James's Park, where we
observed the several engines at work to draw up water, with which sight
I was very much pleased. Above all the rest, I liked best that which Mr.
Greatorex brought, which is one round thing going within all with a pair
of stairs round; round which being laid at an angle of 45 deg., do carry
up the water with a great deal of ease. Here, in the Park, we met with
Mr. Salisbury, who took Mr. Creed and me to the Cockpitt to see "The
Moore of Venice," which was well done. Burt acted the Moore; 'by the
same token, a very pretty lady that sat by me, called out, to see
Desdemona smothered. From thence with Mr. Creed to Hercules Pillars,
where we drank and so parted, and I went home.

12th. Office day all the morning, and from thence with Sir W. Batten and
the rest of the officers to a venison pasty of his at the Dolphin, where
dined withal Col. Washington, Sir Edward Brett, and Major Norwood, very
noble company. After dinner I went home, where I found Mr. Cooke, who
told me that my Lady Sandwich is come to town to-day, whereupon I went
to Westminster to see her, and found her at super, so she made me sit
down all alone with her, and after supper staid and talked with her,
she showing me most extraordinary love and kindness, and do give me good
assurance of my uncle's resolution to make me his heir. From thence home
and to bed.

13th. To my Lord's in the morning, where I met with Captain Cuttance,
but my Lord not being up I went out to Charing Cross, to see
Major-general Harrison hanged, drawn; and quartered; which was done
there, he looking as cheerful as any man could do in that condition. He
was presently cut down, and his head and heart shown to the people, at
which there was great shouts of joy. It is said, that he said that he
was sure to come shortly at the right hand of Christ to judge them that
now had judged him; and that his wife do expect his coming again. Thus
it was my chance to see the King beheaded at White Hall, and to see the
first blood shed in revenge for the blood of the King at Charing Cross.
From thence to my Lord's, and took Captain Cuttance and Mr. Sheply to
the Sun Tavern, and did give them some oysters. After that I went by
water home, where I was angry with my wife for her things lying about,
and in my passion kicked the little fine basket, which I bought her in
Holland, and broke it, which troubled me after I had done it. Within all
the afternoon setting up shelves in my study. At night to bed.

14th (Lord's day). Early to my Lord's, in my way meeting with Dr.
Fairbrother, who walked with me to my father's back again, and there we
drank my morning draft, my father having gone to church and my mother
asleep in bed. Here he caused me to put my hand among a great many
honorable hands to a paper or certificate in his behalf. To White Hall
chappell, where one Dr. Crofts made an indifferent sermon, and after it
an anthem, ill sung, which made the King laugh. Here I first did see the
Princess Royal since she came into England. Here I also observed, how
the Duke of York and Mrs. Palmer did talk to one another very wantonly
through the hangings that parts the King's closet and the closet where
the ladies sit. To my Lord's, where I found my wife, and she and I did
dine with my Lady (my Lord dining with my Lord Chamberlain), who did
treat my wife with a good deal of respect. In the evening we went home
through the rain by water in a sculler, having borrowed some coats of
Mr. Sheply. So home, wet and dirty, and to bed.

15th. Office all the morning. My wife and I by water; I landed her at
Whitefriars, she went to my father's to dinner, it being my father's
wedding day, there being a very great dinner, and only the Fenners and
Joyces there. This morning Mr. Carew

     [John Carew signed the warrant for the execution of Charles I.  He
     held the religion of the Fifth Monarchists, and was tried October
     12th, 1660.  He refused to avail himself of many opportunities of
     escape, and suffered death with much composure.]

was hanged and quartered at Charing Cross; but his quarters, by a great
favour, are not to be hanged up. I was forced to go to my Lord's to get
him to meet the officers of the Navy this afternoon, and so could not go
along with her, but I missed my Lord, who was this day upon the bench
at the Sessions house. So I dined there, and went to White Hall, where I
met with Sir W. Batten and Pen, who with the Comptroller, Treasurer, and
Mr. Coventry (at his chamber) made up a list of such ships as are fit
to be kept out for the winter guard, and the rest to be paid off by the
Parliament when they can get money, which I doubt will not be a great
while. That done, I took coach, and called my wife at my father's, and
so homewards, calling at Thos. Pepys the turner's for some things that
we wanted. And so home, where I fell to read "The Fruitless Precaution"
(a book formerly recommended by Dr. Clerke at sea to me), which I read
in bed till I had made an end of it, and do find it the best writ tale
that ever I read in my life. After that done to sleep, which I did not
very well do, because that my wife having a stopping in her nose she
snored much, which I never did hear her do before.

16th. This morning my brother Tom came to me, with whom I made even for
my last clothes to this day, and having eaten a dish of anchovies with
him in the morning, my wife and I did intend to go forth to see a play
at the Cockpit this afternoon, but Mr. Moore coming to me, my wife
staid at home, and he and I went out together, with whom I called at
the upholsters and several other places that I had business with, and
so home with him to the Cockpit, where, understanding that "Wit without
money" was acted, I would not stay, but went home by water, by the way
reading of the other two stories that are in the book that I read last
night, which I do not like so well as it. Being come home, Will. told
me that my Lord had a mind to speak with me to-night; so I returned
by water, and, coming there, it was only to enquire how the ships were
provided with victuals that are to go with him to fetch over the Queen,
which I gave him a good account of. He seemed to be in a melancholy
humour, which, I was told by W. Howe, was for that he had lately lost
a great deal of money at cards, which he fears he do too much addict
himself to now-a-days. So home by water and to bed.

17th. Office day. At noon came Mr. Creed to me, whom I took along
with me to the Feathers in Fish Street, where I was invited by Captain
Cuttance to dinner, a dinner made by Mr. Dawes and his brother. We had
two or three dishes of meat well done; their great design was to get me
concerned in a business of theirs about a vessel of theirs that is in
the service, hired by the King, in which I promise to do them all the
service I can. From thence home again with Mr. Crew, where I finding
Mrs. The. Turner and her aunt Duke I would not be seen but walked in the
garden till they were gone, where Mr. Spong came to me and Mr. Creed,
Mr. Spong and I went to our music to sing, and he being gone, my wife
and I went to put up my books in order in closet, and I to give her her
books. After that to bed.

18th. This morning, it being expected that Colonel Hacker and Axtell
should die, I went to Newgate, but found they were reprieved till
to-morrow. So to my aunt Fenner's, where with her and my uncle I drank
my morning draft. So to my father's, and did give orders for a pair
of black baize linings to be made me for my breeches against to-morrow
morning, which was done. So to my Lord's, where I spoke with my Lord,
and he would have had me dine with him, but I went thence to Mr.
Blackburne, where I met my wife and my Will's father and mother (the
first time that ever I saw them), where we had a very fine dinner.
Mr. Creed was also there. This day by her high discourse I found Mrs.
Blackburne to be a very high dame and a costly one. Home with my wife
by coach. This afternoon comes Mr. Chaplin and N. Osborn to my house, of
whom I made very much, and kept them with me till late, and so to bed.
At my coming home. I did find that The. Turner hath sent for a pair of
doves that my wife had promised her; and because she did not send them
in the best cage, she sent them back again with a scornful letter, with
which I was angry, but yet pretty well pleased that she was crossed.

19th. Office in the morning. This morning my dining-room was finished
with green serge hanging and gilt leather, which is very handsome. This
morning Hacker and Axtell were hanged and quartered, as the rest are.
This night I sat up late to make up my accounts ready against to-morrow
for my Lord. I found him to be above L80 in my debt, which is a good
sight, and I bless God for it.

20th. This morning one came to me to advise with me where to make me a
window into my cellar in lieu of one which Sir W. Batten had stopped
up, and going down into my cellar to look I stepped into a great heap
of----by which I found that Mr. Turner's house of office is full and
comes into my cellar, which do trouble me, but I shall have it helped.
To my Lord's by land, calling at several places about business, where I
dined with my Lord and Lady; when he was very merry, and did talk very
high how he would have a French cook, and a master of his horse, and his
lady and child to wear black patches; which methought was strange, but
he is become a perfect courtier; and, among other things, my Lady saying
that she could get a good merchant for her daughter Jem., he answered,
that he would rather see her with a pedlar's pack at her back, so she
married a gentleman, than she should marry a citizen. This afternoon,
going through London, and calling at Crowe's the upholster's, in Saint
Bartholomew's, I saw the limbs of some of our new traitors set upon
Aldersgate, which was a sad sight to see; and a bloody week this and the
last have been, there being ten hanged, drawn, and quartered. Home, and
after writing a letter to my uncle by the post, I went to bed.

21st (Lord's day). To the Parish church in the morning, where a good
sermon by Mr. Mills. After dinner to my Lord's, and from thence to the
Abbey, where I met Spicer and D. Vines and others of the old crew. So
leaving my boy at the Abbey against I came back, we went to Prior's by
the Hall back door, but there being no drink to be had we went away,
and so to the Crown in the Palace Yard, I and George Vines by the way
calling at their house, where he carried me up to the top of his turret,
where there is Cooke's head set up for a traytor, and Harrison's set up
on the other side of Westminster Hall. Here I could see them plainly, as
also a very fair prospect about London. From the Crown to the Abbey to
look for my boy, but he was gone thence, and so he being a novice I was
at a loss what was become of him. I called at my Lord's (where I found
Mr. Adams, Mr. Sheply's friend) and at my father's, but found him not.
So home, where I found him, but he had found the way home well enough,
of which I was glad. So after supper, and reading of some chapters, I
went to bed. This day or two my wife has been troubled with her boils in
the old place, which do much trouble her. Today at noon (God forgive me)
I strung my lute, which I had not touched a great while before.

22nd. Office day; after that to dinner at home upon some ribs of roast
beef from the Cook's (which of late we have been forced to do because
of our house being always under the painters' and other people's hands,
that we could not dress it ourselves). After dinner to my Lord's, where
I found all preparing for my Lord's going to sea to fetch the Queen
tomorrow. At night my Lord came home, with whom I staid long, and talked
of many things. Among others I got leave to have his picture, that was
done by Lilly,

     [Peter Lely, afterwards knighted.  He lived in the Piazza, Covent
     Garden.  This portrait was bought by Lord Braybrooke at Mr. Pepys
     Cockerell's sale in 1848, and is now at Audley End.]

copied, and talking of religion, I found him to be a perfect Sceptic,
and said that all things would not be well while there was so much
preaching, and that it would be better if nothing but Homilies were
to be read in Churches. This afternoon (he told me) there hath been a
meeting before the King and my Lord Chancellor, of some Episcopalian and
Presbyterian Divines; but what had passed he could not tell me. After
I had done talk with him, I went to bed with Mr. Sheply in his chamber,
but could hardly get any sleep all night, the bed being ill made and he
a bad bedfellow.

23rd. We rose early in the morning to get things ready for My Lord, and
Mr. Sheply going to put up his pistols (which were charged with bullets)
into the holsters, one of them flew off, and it pleased God that, the
mouth of the gun being downwards, it did us no hurt, but I think I never
was in more danger in my life, which put me into a great fright. About
eight o'clock my Lord went; and going through the garden my Lord met
with Mr. William Montagu, who told him of an estate of land lately come
into the King's hands, that he had a mind my Lord should beg. To which
end my Lord writ a letter presently to my Lord Chancellor to do it for
him, which (after leave taken of my Lord at White Hall bridge) I did
carry to Warwick House to him; and had a fair promise of him, that
he would do it this day for my Lord. In my way thither I met the
Lord Chancellor and all the judges riding on horseback and going to
Westminster Hall, it being the first day of the term, which was the
first time I ever saw any such solemnity. Having done there I returned
to Whitehall, where meeting with my brother Ashwell and his cozen Sam.
Ashwell and Mr. Mallard, I took them to the Leg in King Street and gave
them a dish of meat for dinner and paid for it. From thence going to
Whitehall I met with Catan Stirpin in mourning, who told me that her
mistress was lately dead of the small pox, and that herself was now
married to Monsieur Petit, as also what her mistress had left her, which
was very well. She also took me to her lodging at an Ironmonger's in
King Street, which was but very poor, and I found by a letter that she
shewed me of her husband's to the King, that he is a right Frenchman,
and full of their own projects, he having a design to reform the
universities, and to institute schools for the learning of all
languages, to speak them naturally and not by rule, which I know will
come to nothing. From thence to my Lord's, where I went forth by coach
to Mrs. Parker's with my Lady, and so to her house again. From thence I
took my Lord's picture, and carried it to Mr. de Cretz to be copied. So
to White Hall, where I met Mr. Spong, and went home with him and played,
and sang, and eat with him and his mother. After supper we looked over
many books, and instruments of his, especially his wooden jack in his
chimney, which goes with the smoke, which indeed is very pretty. I found
him to be as ingenious and good-natured a man as ever I met with in my
life, and cannot admire him enough, he being so plain and illiterate a
man as he is. From thence by coach home and to bed, which was welcome to
me after a night's absence.

24th. I lay and slept long to-day. Office day. I took occasion to be
angry with my wife before I rose about her putting up of half a crown of
mine in a paper box, which she had forgot where she had lain it. But we
were friends again as we are always. Then I rose to Jack Cole, who came
to see me. Then to the office, so home to dinner, where I found Captain
Murford, who did put L3 into my hands for a friendship I had done him,
but I would not take it, but bade him keep it till he has enough to buy
my wife a necklace. This afternoon people at work in my house to make a
light in my yard into my cellar. To White Hall, in my way met with Mr.
Moore, who went back with me. He tells me, among other things, that
the Duke of York is now sorry for his lying with my Lord Chancellor's
daughter, who is now brought to bed of a boy. From Whitehall to Mr. De
Cretz, who I found about my Lord's picture. From thence to Mr. Lilly's,
where, not finding Mr. Spong, I went to Mr. Greatorex, where I met him,
and so to an alehouse, where I bought of him a drawing-pen; and he did
show me the manner of the lamp-glasses, which carry the light a great
way, good to read in bed by, and I intend to have one of them. So to Mr.
Lilly's with Mr. Spong, where well received, there being a club to-night
among his friends. Among the rest Esquire Ashmole, who I found was a
very ingenious gentleman. With him we two sang afterward in Mr. Lilly's
study. That done, we all pared; and I home by coach, taking Mr. Booker'
with me, who did tell me a great many fooleries, which may be done by
nativities, and blaming Mr. Lilly for writing to please his friends and
to keep in with the times (as he did formerly to his own dishonour), and
not according to the rules of art, by which he could not well err, as he
had done. I set him down at Lime-street end, and so home, where I found
a box of Carpenter's tools sent by my cozen, Thomas Pepys, which I had
bespoke of him for to employ myself with sometimes. To bed.

25th. All day at home doing something in order to the fitting of my
house. In the evening to Westminster about business. So home and to bed.
This night the vault at the end of the cellar was emptied.

26th. Office. My father and Dr. Thomas Pepys dined at my house, the last
of whom I did almost fox with Margate ale. My father is mightily pleased
with my ordering of my house. I did give him money to pay several bills.
After that I to Westminster to White Hall, where I saw the Duke de
Soissons go from his audience with a very great deal of state: his own
coach all red velvet covered with gold lace, and drawn by six barbes,
and attended by twenty pages very rich in clothes. To Westminster Hall,
and bought, among, other books, one of the Life of our Queen, which I
read at home to my wife; but it was so sillily writ, that we did nothing
but laugh at it: among other things it is dedicated to that paragon of
virtue and beauty, the Duchess of Albemarle. Great talk as if the
Duke of York do now own the marriage between him and the Chancellor's
daughter.

27th. In London and Westminster all this day paying of money and buying
of things for my house. In my going I went by chance by my new Lord
Mayor's house (Sir Richard Browne), by Goldsmith's Hall, which is now
fitting, and indeed is a very pretty house. In coming back I called at
Paul's Churchyard and bought Alsted's Encyclopaedia,' which cost me 38s.
Home and to bed, my wife being much troubled with her old pain.

28th (Lord's day). There came some pills and plaister this morning
from Dr. Williams for my wife. I to Westminster Abbey, where with much
difficulty, going round by the cloysters, I got in; this day being a
great day for the consecrating of five Bishopps, which was done after
sermon; but I could not get into Henry the Seventh's chappell. So I went
to my Lord's, where I dined with my Lady, and my young Lord, and Mr.
Sidney, who was sent for from Twickenham to see my Lord Mayor's show
to-morrow. Mr. Child did also dine with us. After dinner to White Hall
chappell; my Lady and my Lady Jemimah and I up to the King's closet (who
is now gone to meet the Queen). So meeting with one Mr. Hill, that did
know my Lady, he did take us into the King's closet, and there we did
stay all service-time, which I did think a great honour. We went home to
my Lord's lodgings afterwards, and there I parted with my Lady and went
home, where I did find my wife pretty well after her physic. So to bed.

29th. I up early, it being my Lord Mayor's day,

     [When the calendar was reformed in England by the act 24 Geo. II.
     c. 23, different provisions were made as regards those anniversaries
     which affect directly the rights of property and those which do not.
     Thus the old quarter days are still noted in our almanacs, and a
     curious survival of this is brought home to payers of income tax.
     The fiscal year still begins on old Lady-day, which now falls on
     April 6th.  All ecclesiastical fasts and feasts and other
     commemorations which did not affect the rights of property were left
     on their nominal days, such as the execution of Charles I. on
     January 30th and the restoration of Charles II. on May 29th.  The
     change of Lord Mayor's day from the 29th of October to the 9th of
     November was not made by the act for reforming the calendar (c.
     23), but by another act of the same session (c. 48), entitled "An
     Act for the Abbreviation of Michaelmas Term," by which it was
     enacted, "that from and after the said feast of St. Michael, which
     shall be in the year 1752, the said solemnity of presenting and
     swearing the mayors of the city of London, after every annual
     election into the said office, in the manner and form heretofore
     used on the 29th day of October, shall be kept and observed on the
     ninth day of November in every year, unless the same shall fall on
     a Sunday, and in that case on the day following."]

(Sir Richd. Browne), and neglecting my office I went to the Wardrobe,
where I met my Lady Sandwich and all the children; and after drinking of
some strange and incomparable good clarett of Mr. Rumball's he and Mr.
Townsend did take us, and set the young Lords at one Mr. Nevill's, a
draper in Paul's churchyard; and my Lady and my Lady Pickering and I to
one Mr. Isaacson's, a linendraper at the Key in Cheapside; where there
was a company of fine ladies, and we were very civilly treated, and had
a very good place to see the pageants, which were many, and I believe
good, for such kind of things, but in themselves but poor and absurd.
After the ladies were placed I took Mr. Townsend and Isaacson to the
next door, a tavern, and did spend 5s. upon them. The show being done,
we got as far as Paul's with much ado, where I left my Lady in the
coach, and went on foot with my Lady Pickering to her lodging, which was
a poor one in Blackfryars, where she never invited me to go in at all,
which methought was very strange for her to do. So home, where I was
told how my Lady Davis is now come to our next lodgings, and has locked
up the leads door from me, which puts me into so great a disquiet that I
went to bed, and could not sleep till morning at it.

30th. Within all the morning and dined at home, my mind being so
troubled that I could not mind nor do anything till I spoke with the
Comptroller to whom the lodgings belong. In the afternoon, to ease my
mind, I went to the Cockpit all alone, and there saw a very fine play
called "The Tamer Tamed;" very well acted. That being done, I went to
Mr. Crew's, where I had left my boy, and so with him and Mr. Moore
(who would go a little way with me home, as he will always do) to the
Hercules Pillars to drink, where we did read over the King's declaration
in matters of religion, which is come out to-day, which is very well
penned, I think to the satisfaction of most people. So home, where I
am told Mr. Davis's people have broken open the bolt of my chamber door
that goes upon the leads, which I went up to see and did find it so,
which did still trouble me more and more. And so I sent for Griffith,
and got him to search their house to see what the meaning of it might
be, but can learn nothing to-night. But I am a little pleased that I
have found this out. I hear nothing yet of my Lord, whether he be gone
for the Queen from the Downs or no; but I believe he is, and that he is
now upon coming back again.

31st Office day. Much troubled all this morning in my mind about the
business of my walk on the leads. I spoke of it to the Comptroller and
the rest of the principal officers, who are all unwilling to meddle in
anything that may anger my Lady Davis. And so I am fain to give over for
the time that she do continue therein. Dined at home, and after dinner
to Westminster Hall, where I met with Billing the quaker at Mrs.
Michell's shop, who is still of the former opinion he was of against the
clergymen of all sorts, and a cunning fellow I find him to be. Home, and
there I had news that Sir W. Pen is resolved to ride to Sir W. Batten's
country house to-morrow, and would have me go with him, so I sat up
late, getting together my things to ride in, and was fain to cut an old
pair of boots to make leathers for those I was to wear. This month I
conclude with my mind very heavy for the loss of the leads, as also for
the greatness of my late expenses, insomuch that I do not think that I
have above L150 clear money in the world, but I have, I believe, got
a great deal of good household stuff: I hear to-day that the Queen is
landed at Dover, and will be here on Friday next, November 2nd. My wife
has been so ill of late of her old pain that I have not known her this
fortnight almost, which is a pain to me.




NOVEMBER 1660

November 1st. This morning Sir W. Pen and I were mounted early, and had
very merry discourse all the way, he being very good company. We came
to Sir W. Batten's, where he lives like a prince, and we were made very
welcome. Among other things he showed us my Lady's closet, where was
great store of rarities; as also a chair, which he calls King Harry's
chair, where he that sits down is catched with two irons, that come
round about him, which makes good sport. Here dined with us two or
three more country gentle men; among the rest Mr. Christmas, my old
school-fellow, with whom I had much talk. He did remember that I was a
great Roundhead when I was a boy, and I was much afraid that he would
have remembered the words that I said the day the King was beheaded
(that, were I to preach upon him, my text should be "The memory of the
wicked shall rot"); but I found afterwards that he did go away from
school before that time.

     [Pepys might well be anxious on this point, for in October of this
     year Phieas Pett, assistant master shipwright at Chatham, was
     dismissed from his post for having when a Child spoken
     disrespectfully of the King.  See ante, August 23rd.]

He did make us good sport in imitating Mr. Case, Ash, and Nye, the
ministers, which he did very well, but a deadly drinker he is, and grown
exceeding fat. From his house to an ale-house near the church, where we
sat and drank and were merry, and so we mounted for London again, Sir W.
Batten with us. We called at Bow and drank there, and took leave of Mr.
Johnson of Blackwall, who dined with us and rode with us thus far. So
home by moonlight, it being about 9 o'clock before we got home.

2nd. Office. Then dined at home, and by chance Mr. Holliard

     [Thomas Holliard or Hollier was appointed in 1638 surgeon for scald
     heads at St. Thomas's Hospital, and on January 25th, 1643-4, he was
     chosen surgeon in place of Edward Molins.  In 1670 his son of the
     same names was allowed to take his place during his illness.  Ward,
     in his Diary, p.  235, mentions that the porter at St. Thomas's
     Hospital told him, in 1661, of Mr. Holyard's having cut thirty for
     the stone in one year, who all lived.]

called at dinner time and dined with me, with whom I had great discourse
concerning the cure of the King's evil, which he do deny altogether any
effect at all. In the afternoon I went forth and saw some silver bosses
put upon my new Bible, which cost me 6s. 6d. the making, and 7s. 6d. the
silver, which, with 9s. 6d. the book, comes in all to L1 3s. 6d. From
thence with Mr. Cooke that made them, and Mr. Stephens the silversmith
to the tavern, and did give them a pint of wine. So to White Hall, where
when I came I saw the boats going very thick to Lambeth, and all the
stairs to be full of people. I was told the Queen was a-coming;

     ["Nov. 2.  The Queen-mother and the Princess Henrietta came into
     London, the Queen having left this land nineteen years ago.  Her
     coming was very private, Lambeth-way, where the King, Queen, and the
     Duke of York, and the rest, took water, crossed the Thames, and all
     safely arrived at Whitehall.--"Rugge's Diurnal."]

so I got a sculler for sixpence to carry me thither and back again, but
I could not get to see the Queen; so come back, and to my Lord's, where
he was come; and I supt with him, he being very merry, telling merry
stories of the country mayors, how they entertained the King all the
way as he come along; and how the country gentlewomen did hold up their
heads to be kissed by the King, not taking his hand to kiss as they
should do. I took leave of my Lord and Lady, and so took coach at White
Hall and carried Mr. Childe as far as the Strand, and myself got as far
as Ludgate by all the bonfires, but with a great deal of trouble; and
there the coachman desired that I would release him, for he durst not
go further for the fires. So he would have had a shilling or 6d. for
bringing of me so far; but I had but 3d. about me and did give him it.
In Paul's church-yard I called at Kirton's, and there they had got a
mass book for me, which I bought and cost me twelve shillings; and, when
I came home, sat up late and read in it with great pleasure to my wife,
to hear that she was long ago so well acquainted with. So to bed. I
observed this night very few bonfires in the City, not above three in
all London, for the Queen's coming; whereby I guess that (as I believed
before) her coming do please but very few.

3d. Saturday. At home all the morning. In the afternoon to White
Hall, where my Lord and Lady were gone to kiss the Queene's hand. To
Westminster Hall, where I met with Tom Doling, and we two took Mrs. Lane
to the alehouse, where I made her angry with commending of Tom Newton
and her new sweetheart to be both too good for her, so that we parted
with much anger, which made Tom and me good sport. So home to write
letters by the post, and so to bed.

4th (Lord's day). In the morn to our own church, where Mr. Mills did
begin to nibble at the Common Prayer, by saying "Glory be to the Father,
&c." after he had read the two psalms; but the people had been so little
used to it, that they could not tell what to answer. This declaration of
the King's do give the Presbyterians some satisfaction, and a pretence
to read the Common Prayer, which they would not do before because of
their former preaching against it. After dinner to Westminster, where I
went to my Lord's, and having spoke with him, I went to the Abbey, where
the first time that ever I heard the organs in a cathedral! Thence to
my Lord's, where I found Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, and with him and Mr.
Sheply, in our way calling at the Bell to see the seven Flanders mares
that my Lord has bought lately, where we drank several bottles of Hull
ale. Much company I found to come to her, and cannot wonder at it, for
she is very pretty and wanton. Hence to my father's, where I found my
mother in greater and greater pain of the stone. I staid long and drank
with them, and so home and to bed. My wife seemed very pretty to-day, it
being the first time I had given her leave to wear a black patch.

5th (Office day). Being disappointed of money, we failed of going to
Deptford to pay off the Henrietta to-day. Dined at home, and at home all
day, and at the office at night, to make up an account of what the debts
of nineteen of the twenty-five ships that should have been paid off,
is increased since the adjournment of the Parliament, they being to sit
again to-morrow. This 5th of November is observed exceeding well in the
City; and at night great bonfires and fireworks. At night Mr. Moore came
and sat with me, and there I took a book and he did instruct me in many
law notions, in which I took great pleasure. To bed.

6th. In the morning with Sir W. Batten and Pen by water to Westminster,
where at my Lord's I met with Mr. Creed. With him to see my Lord's
picture (now almost done), and thence to Westminster Hall, where we
found the Parliament met to-day, and thence meeting with Mr. Chetwind,
I took them to the Sun, and did give them a barrel of oysters, and had
good discourse; among other things Mr. Chetwind told me how he did fear
that this late business of the Duke of York's would prove fatal to my
Lord Chancellor. From thence Mr. Creed and I to Wilkinson's, and dined
together, and in great haste thence to our office, where we met all, for
the sale of two ships by an inch of candle

     [The old-fashioned custom of sale by auction by inch of candle was
     continued in sales by the Admiralty to a somewhat late date.  See
     September 3rd, 1662.]

(the first time that ever I saw any of this kind), where I observed how
they do invite one another, and at last how they all do cry,--[To cry
was to bid.]--and we have much to do to tell who did cry last. The ships
were the Indian, sold for L1,300, and the Half-moon, sold for L830.
Home, and fell a-reading of the tryalls of the late men that were hanged
for the King's death, and found good satisfaction in reading thereof. At
night to bed, and my wife and I did fall out about the dog's being put
down into the cellar, which I had a mind to have done because of his
fouling the house, and I would have my will, and so we went to bed and
lay all night in a quarrel. This night I was troubled all night with a
dream that my wife was dead, which made me that I slept ill all night.

7th (Office day). This day my father came to dine at my house, but being
sent for in the morning I could not stay, but went by water to my Lord,
where I dined with him, and he in a very merry humour (present Mr.
Borfett and Childe) at dinner: he, in discourse of the great opinion of
the virtue--gratitude (which he did account the greatest thing in the
world to him, and had, therefore, in his mind been often troubled in
the late times how to answer his gratitude to the King, who raised his
father), did say it was that did bring him to his obedience to the King;
and did also bless himself with his good fortune, in comparison to
what it was when I was with him in the Sound, when he durst not own his
correspondence with the King; which is a thing that I never did hear of
to this day before; and I do from this raise an opinion of him, to be
one of the most secret men in the world, which I was not so convinced of
before. After dinner he bid all go out of the room, and did tell me
how the King had promised him L4000 per annum for ever, and had already
given him a bill under his hand (which he showed me) for L4000 that Mr.
Fox is to pay him. My Lord did advise with me how to get this received,
and to put out L3000 into safe hands at use, and the other he will make
use of for his present occasion. This he did advise with me about with
much secresy. After all this he called for the fiddles and books, and we
two and W. Howe, and Mr. Childe, did sing and play some psalmes of Will.
Lawes's, and some songs; and so I went away. So I went to see my Lord's
picture, which is almost done, and do please me very well. Hence to
Whitehall to find out Mr. Fox, which I did, and did use me very civilly,
but I did not see his lady, whom I had so long known when she was a
maid, Mrs. Whittle. From thence meeting my father Bowyer, I took him to
Mr. Harper's, and there drank with him. Among other things in discourse
he told me how my wife's brother had a horse at grass with him, which
I was troubled to hear, it being his boldness upon my score. Home by
coach, and read late in the last night's book of Trials, and told
my wife about her brother's horse at Mr. Bowyer's, who is also much
troubled for it, and do intend to go to-morrow to inquire the truth.
Notwithstanding this was the first day of the King's proclamation
against hackney coaches coming into the streets to stand to be hired,
yet I got one to carry me home.

     ["A Proclamation to restrain the abuses of Hackney Coaches in the
     Cities of London and Westminster and the Suburbs thereof."  This is
     printed in "Notes and Queries," First Series, vol. viii.  p. 122.
     "In April, 1663, the poor widows of hackney-coachmen petitioned for
     some relief, as the parliament had reduced the number of coaches to
     400; there were before, in and about London, more than 2,000."
     --Rugge's Diurnal.]

8th. This morning Sir Wm. and the Treasurer and I went by barge with Sir
Wm. Doyley and Mr. Prin to Deptford, to pay off the Henrietta, and had
a good dinner. I went to Mr. Davys's and saw his house (where I was
once before a great while ago) and I found him a very pretty man. In the
afternoon Commissioner Pett and I went on board the yacht, which indeed
is one of the finest things that ever I saw for neatness and room in so
small a vessel. Mr. Pett is to make one to outdo this for the honour of
his country, which I fear he will scarce better. From thence with him
as far as Ratcliffe, where I left him going by water to London, and
I (unwilling to leave the rest of the officers) went back again to
Deptford, and being very much troubled with a sudden looseness, I went
into a little alehouse at the end of Ratcliffe, and did give a groat for
a pot of ale, and there I did... So went forward in my walk with some
men that were going that way a great pace, and in our way we met with
many merry seamen that had got their money paid them to-day. We sat very
late doing the work and waiting for the tide, it being moonshine we got
to London before two in the morning. So home, where I found my wife up,
she shewed me her head which was very well dressed to-day, she having
been to see her father and mother. So to bed.

9th. Lay long in bed this morning though an office day, because of our
going to bed late last night. Before I went to my office Mr. Creed came
to me about business, and also Mr. Carter, my old Cambridge friend, came
to give me a visit, and I did give them a morning draught in my study.
So to the office, and from thence to dinner with Mr. Wivell at the
Hoop Tavern, where we had Mr. Shepley, Talbot, Adams, Mr. Chaplin and
Osborne, and our dinner given us by Mr. Ady and another, Mr. Wine, the
King's fishmonger. Good sport with Mr. Talbot, who eats no sort of fish,
and there was nothing else till we sent for a neat's tongue. From thence
to Whitehall where I found my Lord, who had an organ set up to-day in
his dining-room, but it seems an ugly one in the form of Bridewell.
Thence I went to Sir Harry Wright's, where my Lord was busy at cards,
and so I staid below with Mrs. Carter and Evans (who did give me a
lesson upon the lute), till he came down, and having talked with him
at the door about his late business of money, I went to my father's and
staid late talking with my father about my sister Pall's coming to live
with me if she would come and be as a servant (which my wife did seem to
be pretty willing to do to-day), and he seems to take it very well, and
intends to consider of it. Home and to bed.

10th. Up early. Sir Wm. Batten and I to make up an account of the wages
of the officers and mariners at sea, ready to present to the Committee
of Parliament this afternoon. Afterwards came the Treasurer and
Comptroller, and sat all the morning with us till the business was done.
So we broke up, leaving the thing to be wrote over fair and carried to
Trinity House for Sir Wm. Batten's hand. When staying very long I found
(as appointed) the Treasurer and Comptroller at Whitehall, and so we
went with a foul copy to the Parliament house, where we met with
Sir Thos. Clarges and Mr. Spry, and after we had given them good
satisfaction we parted. The Comptroller and I to the coffee-house,
where he shewed me the state of his case; how the King did owe him about
L6000. But I do not see great likelihood for them to be paid, since they
begin already in Parliament to dispute the paying of the just sea-debts,
which were already promised to be paid, and will be the undoing of
thousands if they be not paid. So to Whitehall to look but could not
find Mr. Fox, and then to Mr. Moore at Mr. Crew's, but missed of him
also. So to Paul's Churchyard, and there bought Montelion, which this
year do not prove so good as the last was; so after reading it I burnt
it. After reading of that and the comedy of the Rump, which is also very
silly, I went to bed. This night going home, Will and I bought a goose.

11th (Lord's day). This morning I went to Sir W. Batten's about going
to Deptford to-morrow, and so eating some hog's pudding of my Lady's
making, of the hog that I saw a fattening the other day at her house, he
and I went to Church into our new gallery, the first time it was used,
and it not being yet quite finished, there came after us Sir W. Pen, Mr.
Davis, and his eldest son. There being no woman this day, we sat in the
foremost pew, and behind us our servants, and I hope it will not always
be so, it not being handsome for our servants to sit so equal with us.
This day also did Mr. Mills begin to read all the Common Prayer, which I
was glad of. Home to dinner, and then walked to Whitehall, it being
very cold and foul and rainy weather. I found my Lord at home, and
after giving him an account of some business, I returned and went to
my father's where I found my wife, and there we supped, and Dr. Thomas
Pepys, who my wife told me after I was come home, that he had told my
brother Thomas that he loved my wife so well that if she had a child
he would never marry, but leave all that he had to my child, and after
supper we walked home, my little boy carrying a link, and Will leading
my wife. So home and to prayers and to bed. I should have said that
before I got to my Lord's this day I went to Mr. Fox's at Whitehall,
when I first saw his lady, formerly Mrs. Elizabeth Whittle, whom I had
formerly a great opinion of, and did make an anagram or two upon her
name when I was a boy. She proves a very fine lady, and mother to fine
children. To-day I agreed with Mr. Fox about my taking of the; L4000 of
him that the King had given my Lord.

12th. Lay long in bed to-day. Sir Wm. Batten went this morning to
Deptford to pay off the Wolf. Mr. Comptroller and I sat a while at the
office to do business, and thence I went with him to his house in Lime
Street, a fine house, and where I never was before, and from thence by
coach (setting down his sister at the new Exchange) to Westminster Hall,
where first I met with Jack Spicer and agreed with him to help me to
tell money this afternoon. Hence to De Cretz, where I saw my Lord's
picture finished, which do please me very well. So back to the Hall,
where by appointment I met the Comptroller, and with him and three or
four Parliament men I dined at Heaven, and after dinner called at Will's
on Jack Spicer, and took him to Mr. Fox's, who saved me the labour of
telling me the money by giving me; L3000 by consent (the other L1000 I
am to have on Thursday next), which I carried by coach to the Exchequer,
and put it up in a chest in Spicer's office. From thence walked to my
father's, where I found my wife, who had been with my father to-day,
buying of a tablecloth and a dozen of napkins of diaper the first that
ever I bought in my life. My father and I took occasion to go forth, and
went and drank at Mr. Standing's, and there discoursed seriously about
my sister's coming to live with me, which I have much mind for her good
to have, and yet I am much afeard of her ill-nature. Coming home again,
he and I, and my wife, my mother and Pall, went all together into the
little room, and there I told her plainly what my mind was, to have
her come not as a sister in any respect, but as a servant, which she
promised me that she would, and with many thanks did weep for joy, which
did give me and my wife some content and satisfaction. So by coach home
and to bed. The last night I should have mentioned how my wife and I
were troubled all night with the sound of drums in our ears, which in
the morning we found to be Mr. Davys's jack,

     [The date of the origin of smoke jacks does not appear to be known,
     but the first patent taken out for an improved smoke-jack by Peter
     Clare is dated December 24th, 1770.  The smoke jack consists of a
     wind-wheel fixed in the chimney, which communicates motion by means
     of an endless band to a pulley, whence the motion is transmitted to
     the spit by gearing.  In the valuable introduction to the volume of
     "Abridgments of Specifications relating to Cooking, 1634-1866"
     (Patent Office), mention is made of an Italian work by Bartolomeo
     Scappi, published first at Rome in 1572, and afterwards reprinted at
     Venice in 1622, which gives a complete account of the kitchens of
     the time and the utensils used in them.  In the plates several
     roasting-jacks are represented, one worked by smoke or hot air and
     one by a spring.]

but not knowing the cause of its going all night, I understand to-day
that they have had a great feast to-day.

13th. Early going to my Lord's I met with Mr. Moore, who was going to my
house, and indeed I found him to be a most careful, painful,--[Painful,
i.e. painstaking or laborious. Latimer speaks of the "painful
magistrates."]--and able man in business, and took him by water to the
Wardrobe, and shewed him all the house; and indeed there is a great deal
of room in it, but very ugly till my Lord hath bestowed great cost upon
it. So to the Exchequer, and there took Spicer and his fellow clerks
to the Dog tavern, and did give them a peck of oysters, and so home to
dinner, where I found my wife making of pies and tarts to try, her oven
with, which she has never yet done, but not knowing the nature of it,
did heat it too hot, and so a little overbake her things, but knows how
to do better another time. At home all the afternoon. At night made up
my accounts of my sea expenses in order to my clearing off my imprest
bill of L30 which I had in my hands at the beginning of my voyage; which
I intend to shew to my Lord to-morrow. To bed.

14th (Office day). But this day was the first that we do begin to sit
in the afternoon, and not in the forenoon, and therefore I went into
Cheapside to Mr. Beauchamp's, the goldsmith, to look out a piece of
plate to give Mr. Fox from my Lord, for his favour about the L4,000,
and did choose a gilt tankard. So to Paul's Churchyard and bought
"Cornelianum dolium:"

     ["Cornelianum dolium" is a Latin comedy, by T. R., published at
     London in 1638.  Douce attributed it to Thomas Randolph (d. 1635).
     The book has a frontispiece representing the sweating tub which,
     from the name of the patient, was styled Cornelius's tub.  There is
     a description of the play in the "European Magazine," vol. xxxvii.
     (1805), p. 343]

So home to dinner, and after that to the office till late at night, and
so Sir W. Pen, the Comptroller, and I to the Dolphin, where we found Sir
W. Batten, who is seldom a night from hence, and there we did drink
a great quantity of sack and did tell many merry stories, and in good
humours we were all. So home and to bed.

15th. To Westminster, and it being very cold upon the water I went all
alone to the Sun and drank a draft of mulled white wine, and so to Mr.
de Cretz, whither I sent for J. Spicer (to appoint him to expect me this
afternoon at the office, with the other L1000 from Whitehall), and
here we staid and did see him give some finishing touches to my Lord's
picture, so at last it is complete to my mind, and I leave mine with him
to copy out another for himself, and took the original by a porter with
me to my Lord's, where I found my Lord within, and staid hearing him and
Mr. Child playing upon my Lord's new organ, the first time I ever heard
it. My Lord did this day show me the King's picture, which was done in
Flanders, that the King did promise my Lord before he ever saw him, and
that we did expect to have had at sea before the King came to us; but
it came but to-day, and indeed it is the most pleasant and the most like
him that ever I saw picture in my life. As dinner was coming on table,
my wife came to my Lord's, and I got her carried in to my Lady, who took
physic to-day, and was just now hiring of a French maid that was with
her, and they could not understand one another till my wife came to
interpret. Here I did leave my wife to dine with my Lord, the first time
he ever did take notice of her as my wife, and did seem to have a just
esteem for her. And did myself walk homewards (hearing that Sir W. Pen
was gone before in a coach) to overtake him and with much ado at last
did in Fleet Street, and there I went in to him, and there was Sir
Arnold Brames, and we all three to Sir W. Batten's to dinner, he having
a couple of Servants married to-day; and so there was a great number of
merchants, and others of good quality on purpose after dinner to make
an offering, which, when dinner was done, we did, and I did give ten
shillings and no more, though I believe most of the rest did give more,
and did believe that I did so too. From thence to Whitehall again by
water to Mr. Fox and by two porters carried away the other L1000. He was
not within himself, but I had it of his kinsman, and did give him L4.
and other servants something; but whereas I did intend to have given Mr.
Fox himself a piece of plate of L50 I was demanded L100, for the fee of
the office at 6d. a pound, at which I was surprised, but, however, I
did leave it there till I speak with my Lord. So I carried it to the
Exchequer, where at Will's I found Mr. Spicer, and so lodged it at his
office with the rest. From thence after a pot of ale at Will's I took
boat in the dark and went for all that to the old Swan, and so to Sir
Wm. Batten's, and leaving some of the gallants at cards I went home,
where I found my wife much satisfied with my Lord's discourse and
respect to her, and so after prayers to bed.

16th. Up early to my father's, where by appointment Mr. Moore came to
me, and he and I to the Temple, and thence to Westminster Hall to speak
with Mr. Wm. Montagu about his looking upon the title of those lands
which I do take as security for L3000 of my Lord's money. That being
done Mr. Moore and I parted, and in the Hall I met with Mr. Fontleroy
(my old acquaintance, whom I had not seen a long time), and he and I to
the Swan, and in discourse he seems to be wise and say little, though I
know things are changed against his mind. Thence home by water, where my
father, Mr. Snow, and Mr. Moore did dine with me. After dinner Mr. Snow
and I went up together to discourse about the putting out of L80 to a
man who lacks the money and would give me L15 per annum for 8 years
for it, which I did not think profit enough, and so he seemed to be
disappointed by my refusal of it, but I would not now part with my money
easily. He seems to do it as a great favour to me to offer to come in
upon a way of getting of money, which they call Bottomry,

     ["The contract of bottomry is a negotiable instrument, which may be
     put in suit by the person to whom it is transferred; it is in use in
     all countries of maritime commerce and interests.  A contract in the
     nature of a mortgage of a ship, when the owner of it borrows money
     to enable him to carry on the voyage, and pledges the keel or bottom
     of the ship as a security for the repayment.  If the ship be lost
     the lender loses his whole money; but if it returns in safety, then
     he shall receive back his principal, and also the premium stipulated
     to be paid, however it may exceed the usual or legal rate of
     interest."--Smyth's "Sailor's Word Book".]

which I do not yet understand, but do believe there may be something in
it of great profit. After we were parted I went to the office, and there
we sat all the afternoon, and at night we went to a barrel of oysters
at Sir W. Batten's, and so home, and I to the setting of my papers in
order, which did keep me up late. So to bed.

17th. In the morning to Whitehall, where I inquired at the Privy
Seal Office for a form for a nobleman to make one his Chaplain. But I
understanding that there is not any, I did draw up one, and so to my
Lord's, and there I did give him it to sign for Mr. Turner to be his
first Chaplain. I did likewise get my Lord to sign my last sea accounts,
so that I am even to this day when I have received the balance of Mr.
Creed. I dined with my Lady and my Lady Pickering, where her son John
dined with us, who do continue a fool as he ever was since I knew him.
His mother would fain marry him to get a portion for his sister Betty
but he will not hear of it. Hither came Major Hart this noon, who tells
me that the Regiment is now disbanded, and that there is some money
coming to me for it. I took him to my Lord to Mr. Crew's, and from
thence with Mr. Shepley and Mr. Moore to the Devil Tavern, and there we
drank. So home and wrote letters by the post. Then to my lyra viall,

     [The lyre viol is a viol with extra open bass strings, holding the
     same relation to the viol as the theorbo does to the lute.  A volume
     entitled "Musick's Recreation on the Lyra Viol," was printed by John
     Playford in 1650.]

and to bed.

18th (Lord's day). In the morning to our own church, Where Mr. Powel (a
crook legged man that went formerly with me to Paul's School), preached
a good sermon. In the afternoon to our own church and my wife with me
(the first time that she and my Lady Batten came to sit in our new pew),
and after sermon my Lady took us home and there we supped with her and
Sir W. Batten, and Pen, and were much made of. The first time that ever
my wife was there. So home and to bed.

19th (Office day). After we had done a little at the office this
morning, I went with the Treasurer in his coach to White Hall, and in
our way, in discourse, do find him a very good-natured man; and, talking
of those men who now stand condemned for murdering the King, he says
that he believes that, if the law would give leave, the King is a man of
so great compassion that he would wholly acquit them. Going to my Lord's
I met with Mr. Shepley, and so he and I to the Sun, and I did give him a
morning draft of Muscadine.

     [Muscadine or muscadel, a rich sort of wine.  'Vinum muscatum quod
     moschi odorem referat.'

              "Quaffed off the muscadel, and threw the sops
               All in the sexton's face."

               Shakespeare, Taming of the Shrew, act iii.  SC. 2.--M. B.]

And so to see my Lord's picture at De Cretz, and he says it is very like
him, and I say so too. After that to Westminster Hall, and there hearing
that Sir W. Batten was at the Leg in the Palace, I went thither, and
there dined with him and some of the Trinity House men who had obtained
something to-day at the House of Lords concerning the Ballast Office.
After dinner I went by water to London to the Globe in Cornhill, and
there did choose two pictures to hang up in my house, which my wife
did not like when I came home, and so I sent the picture of Paris back
again. To the office, where we sat all the afternoon till night. So
home, and there came Mr. Beauchamp to me with the gilt tankard, and I
did pay him for it L20. So to my musique and sat up late at it, and so
to bed, leaving my wife to sit up till 2 o'clock that she may call the
wench up to wash.

20th. About two o'clock my wife wakes me, and comes to bed, and so both
to sleep and the wench to wash. I rose and with Will to my Lord's by
land, it being a very hard frost, the first we have had this year. There
I staid with my Lord and Mr. Shepley, looking over my Lord's accounts
and to set matters straight between him and Shepley, and he did commit
the viewing of these accounts to me, which was a great joy to me to see
that my Lord do look upon me as one to put trust in. Hence to the organ,
where Mr. Child and one Mr Mackworth (who plays finely upon the violin)
were playing, and so we played till dinner and then dined, where my Lord
in a very good humour and kind to me. After dinner to the Temple, where
I met Mr. Moore and discoursed with him about the business of putting
out my Lord's L3000, and that done, Mr. Shepley and I to the new
Play-house near Lincoln's-Inn-Fields (which was formerly Gibbon's
tennis-court), where the play of "Beggar's Bush" was newly begun; and so
we went in and saw it, it was well acted: and here I saw the first time
one Moone,

     [Michael Mohun, or Moone, the celebrated actor, who had borne a
     major's commission in the King's army.  The period of his death is
     uncertain, but he is known to have been dead in 1691.  Downes
     relates that an eminent poet [Lee] seeing him act Mithridates
     "vented suddenly this saying: 'Oh, Mohun, Mohun, thou little man of
     mettle, if I should write a 100, I'd write a part for thy mouth.'"
     --Roscius Anglicanus, p.  17.]

who is said to be the best actor in the world, lately come over with the
King, and indeed it is the finest play-house, I believe, that ever was
in England. From thence, after a pot of ale with Mr. Shepley at a house
hard by, I went by link home, calling a little by the way at my father's
and my uncle Fenner's, where all pretty well, and so home, where I found
the house in a washing pickle, and my wife in a very joyful condition
when I told her that she is to see the Queen next Thursday, which puts
me in mind to say that this morning I found my Lord in bed late, he
having been with the King, Queen, and Princess, at the Cockpit

     [The Cockpit at Whitehall.  The plays at the Cockpit in Drury Lane
     were acted in the afternoon.]

all night, where. General Monk treated them; and after supper a play,
where the King did put a great affront upon Singleton's' musique, he
bidding them stop and bade the French musique play, which, my Lord says,
do much outdo all ours. But while my Lord was rising, I went to Mr.
Fox's, and there did leave the gilt tankard for Mrs. Fox, and then to
the counting-house to him, who hath invited me and my wife to dine with
him on Thursday next, and so to see the Queen and Princesses.

21st. Lay long in bed. This morning my cozen Thomas Pepys, the turner,
sent me a cupp of lignum vitae

     [A hard, compact, black-green wood, obtained from 'Guaiacum
     offcinale', from which pestles, ship-blocks, rollers, castors, &c.,
     are turned.]

for a token. This morning my wife and I went to Paternoster Row, and
there we bought some green watered moyre for a morning wastecoate. And
after that we went to Mr. Cade's' to choose some pictures for our house.
After that my wife went home, and I to Pope's Head, and bought me an
aggate hafted knife, which cost me 5s. So home to dinner, and so to the
office all the afternoon, and at night to my viallin (the first time
that I have played on it since I came to this house) in my dining room,
and afterwards to my lute there, and I took much pleasure to have the
neighbours come forth into the yard to hear me. So down to supper, and
sent for the barber, who staid so long with me that he was locked into
the house, and we were fain to call up Griffith, to let him out. So up
to bed, leaving my wife to wash herself, and to do other things against
to-morrow to go to court.

22d. This morning came the carpenters to make me a door at the other
side of my house, going into the entry, which I was much pleased with.
At noon my wife and I walked to the Old Exchange, and there she bought
her a white whisk

     [A gorget or neckerchief worn by women at this time.  "A woman's
     neck whisk is used both plain and laced, and is called of most a
     gorget or falling whisk, because it falleth about the shoulders."
     --Randle Hohnt (quoted by Planche).]

and put it on, and I a pair of gloves, and so we took coach for
Whitehall to Mr. Fox's, where we found Mrs. Fox within, and an alderman
of London paying L1000 or L1500 in gold upon the table for the King,
which was the most gold that ever I saw together in my life. Mr. Fox
came in presently and did receive us with a great deal of respect; and
then did take my wife and I to the Queen's presence-chamber; where he
got my wife placed behind the Queen's chair, and I got into the crowd,
and by and by the Queen and the two Princesses came to dinner. The Queen
a very little plain old woman, and nothing more in her presence in any
respect nor garb than any ordinary woman. The Princess of Orange I had
often seen before. The Princess Henrietta is very pretty, but much below
my expectation; and her dressing of herself with her hair frized short
up to her ears, did make her seem so much the less to me. But my wife
standing near her with two or three black patches on, and well dressed,
did seem to me much handsomer than she. Dinner being done, we went to
Mr. Fox's again, where many gentlemen dined with us, and most princely
dinner, all provided for me and my friends, but I bringing none but
myself and wife, he did call the company to help to eat up so much good
victuals. At the end of dinner, my Lord Sandwich's health was drunk in
the gilt tankard that I did give to Mrs. Fox the other day. After dinner
I had notice given me by Will my man that my Lord did inquire for me,
so I went to find him, and met him and the Duke of York in a coach going
towards Charing Cross. I endeavoured to follow them but could not, so
I returned to Mr. Fox, and after much kindness and good discourse we
parted from thence. I took coach for my wife and me homewards, and I
light at the Maypole in the Strand, and sent my wife home. I to the new
playhouse and saw part of the "Traitor," a very good Tragedy; Mr. Moon
did act the Traitor very well. So to my Lord's, and sat there with my
Lady a great while talking. Among other things, she took occasion to
inquire (by Madame Dury's late discourse with her) how I did treat my
wife's father and mother. At which I did give her a good account, and
she seemed to be very well opinioned of my wife. From thence to White
Hall at about 9 at night, and there, with Laud the page that went with
me, we could not get out of Henry the Eighth's gallery into the further
part of the boarded gallery, where my Lord was walking with my Lord
Ormond; and we had a key of Sir S. Morland's, but all would not do; till
at last, by knocking, Mr. Harrison the door-keeper did open us the door,
and, after some talk with my Lord about getting a catch to carry my Lord
St. Albans a goods to France, I parted and went home on foot, it being
very late and dirty, and so weary to bed.

23rd. This morning standing looking upon the workmen doing of my new
door to my house, there comes Captain Straughan the Scot (to whom the
King has given half of the money that the two ships lately sold do
bring), and he would needs take me to the Dolphin, and give me a glass
of ale and a peck of oysters, he and I. He did talk much what he is able
to advise the King for good husbandry in his ships, as by ballasting
them with lead ore and many other tricks, but I do believe that he is a
knowing man in sea-business. Home and dined, and in the afternoon to the
office, where till late, and that being done Mr. Creed did come to speak
with me, and I took him to the Dolphin, where there was Mr. Pierce the
purser and his wife and some friends of theirs. So I did spend a crown
upon them behind the bar, they being akin to the people of the house,
and this being the house where Mr. Pierce was apprentice. After they
were gone Mr. Creed and I spent an hour in looking over the account
which he do intend to pass in our office for his lending moneys, which
I did advise about and approve or disapprove of as I saw cause. After
an hour being, serious at this we parted about 11 o'clock at night. So I
home and to bed, leaving my wife and the maid at their linen to get up.

24th. To my Lord's, where after I had done talking with him Mr.
Townsend, Rumball, Blackburn, Creed and Shepley and I to the Rhenish
winehouse, and there I did give them two quarts of Wormwood wine,

     [Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) is celebrated for its intensely
     bitter, tonic, and stimulating qualities, which have caused it to be
     used in various medicinal preparations, and also in the making of
     liqueurs, as wormwood wine and creme d'absinthe.]

and so we broke up. So we parted, and I and Mr. Creed to Westminster
Hall and looked over a book or two, and so to my Lord's, where I dined
with my lady, there being Mr. Child and Mrs. Borfett, who are never
absent at dinner there, under pretence of a wooing. From thence I to Mr.
de Cretz and did take away my Lord's picture, which is now finished for
me, and I paid L3 10s. for it and the frame, and am well pleased with it
and the price. So carried it home by water, Will being with me. At home,
and had a fire made in my closet, and put my papers and books and things
in order, and that being done I fell to entering these two good songs of
Mr. Lawes, "Helpe, helpe, O helpe," and "O God of Heaven and Hell" in my
song book, to which I have got Mr. Child to set the base to the Theorbo,
and that done to bed.

25th (Lord's day). In the forenoon I alone to our church, and after
dinner I went and ranged about to many churches, among the rest to the
Temple, where I heard Dr. Wilkins' a little (late Maister of Trinity
in Cambridge). That being done to my father's to see my mother who is
troubled much with the stone, and that being done I went home, where I
had a letter brought me from my Lord to get a ship ready to carry the
Queen's things over to France, she being to go within five or six days.
So to supper and to bed.

26th (Office day). To it all the morning, and dined at home where my
father come and dined with me, who seems to take much pleasure to have
a son that is neat in his house. I being now making my new door into the
entry, which he do please himself much with. After dinner to the office
again, and there till night. And that being done the Comptroller and
I to the Mitre to a glass of wine, when we fell into a discourse of
poetry, and he did repeat some verses of his own making which were very
good. Home, there hear that my Lady Batten had given my wife a visit
(the first that ever she made her), which pleased me exceedingly. So
after supper to bed.

27th. To Whitehall, where I found my Lord gone abroad to the Wardrobe,
whither he do now go every other morning, and do seem to resolve
to understand and look after the business himself. From thence to
Westminster Hall, and in King Street there being a great stop of
coaches, there was a falling out between a drayman and my Lord
Chesterfield's coachman, and one of his footmen killed. At the Hall I
met with Mr. Creed, and he and I to Hell to drink our morning draught,
and so to my Lord's again, where I found my wife, and she and I dined
with him and my Lady, and great company of my Lord's friends, and my
Lord did show us great respect. Soon as dinner was done my wife took
her leave, and went with Mr. Blackburne and his wife to London to a
christening of a Brother's child of his on Tower Hill, and I to a play,
"The Scorn-full Lady," and that being done, I went homewards, and met
Mr. Moore, who had been at my house, and took him to my father's, and we
three to Standing's to drink. Here Mr. Moore told me how the House had
this day voted the King to have all the Excise for ever. This day I do
also hear that the Queen's going to France is stopt, which do like, me
well, because then the King will be in town the next month, which is my
month again at the Privy Seal. From thence home, where when I come I
do remember that I did leave my boy Waineman at Whitehall with order to
stay there for me in the court, at which I was much troubled, but about
11 o'clock at night the boy came home well, and so we all to bed.

28th. This morning went to Whitehall to my Lord's, where Major Hart did
pay me; L23 14s. 9d., due to me upon my pay in my Lord's troop at the
time of our disbanding, which is a great blessing to have without taking
any law in the world for. But now I must put an end to any hopes of
getting any more, so that I bless God for this. From thence with Mr.
Shepley and Pinkney to the Sun, and did give them a glass of wine and a
peck of oysters for joy of my getting this money. So home, where I
found that Mr. Creed had sent me the L11 5s. that is due to me upon
the remains of account for my sea business, which is also so much clear
money to me, and my bill of impresse

     [For "bill of impress" In Italian 'imprestare' means "to lend."  In
     the ancient accounts of persons officially employed by the crown,
     money advanced, paid on, account, was described as "de prestito," or
     "in prestitis."--M. B.]

for L30 is also cleared, so that I am wholly clear as to the sea in all
respects. To the office, and was there till late at night, and among
the officers do hear that they may have our salaries allowed by the
Treasurer, which do make me very glad, and praise God for it. Home to
supper, and Mr. Hater supped with me, whom I did give order to take up
my money of the Treasurer to-morrow if it can be had. So to bed.

29th. In the morning seeing a great deal of foul water come into my
parlour from under the partition between me and Mr. Davis, I did step
thither to him and tell him of it, and he did seem very ready to have
it stopt, and did also tell me how thieves did attempt to rob his house
last night, which do make us all afraid. This noon I being troubled that
the workmen that I have to do my door were called to Mr. Davis's away,
I sent for them, when Mr. Davis sent to inquire a reason of, and I did
give him a good one, that they were come on purpose to do some work with
me that they had already begun, with which he was well pleased, and I
glad, being unwilling to anger them. In the afternoon Sir W. Batten and
I met and did sell the ship Church for L440; and we asked L391, and that
being done, I went home, and Dr. Petty came to me about Mr. Barlow's
money, and I being a little troubled to be so importuned before I had
received it, and that they would have it stopt in Mr. Fenn's hands, I
did force the Doctor to go fetch the letter of attorney that he had to
receive it only to make him same labour, which he did bring, and Mr.
Hales came along with him from the Treasury with my money for the first
quarter (Michaelmas last) that ever I received for this employment. So I
paid the Dr. L25 and had L62 10s. for myself, and L7 10s. to myself also
for Will's salary, which I do intend yet to keep for myself. With this
my heart is much rejoiced, and do bless Almighty God that he is pleased
to send so sudden and unexpected payment of my salary so soon after my
great disbursements. So that now I am worth L200 again. In a great
ease of mind and spirit I fell about the auditing of Mr. Shepley's last
accounts with my Lord by my Lord's desire, and about that I sat till
12 o'clock at night, till I began to doze, and so to bed, with my heart
praising God for his mercy to us.

30th (Office day). To the office, where Sir G. Carteret did give us an
account how Mr. Holland do intend to prevail with the Parliament to try
his project of discharging the seamen all at present by ticket, and so
promise interest to all men that will lend money upon them at eight per
cent., for so long as they are unpaid; whereby he do think to take away
the growing debt, which do now lie upon the kingdom for lack of present
money to discharge the seamen. But this we are, troubled at as some
diminution to us. I having two barrels of oysters at home, I caused one
of them and some wine to be brought to the inner room in the office, and
there the Principal Officers did go and eat them. So we sat till noon,
and then to dinner, and to it again in the afternoon till night. At
home I sent for Mr. Hater, and broke the other barrel with him, and did
afterwards sit down discoursing of sea terms to learn of him. And he
being gone I went up and sat till twelve at night again to make an end
of my Lord's accounts, as I did the last night. Which at last I made a
good end of, and so to bed.




DECEMBER 1660

December 1st. This morning, observing some things to be laid up not as
they should be by the girl, I took a broom and basted her till she
cried extremely, which made me vexed, but before I went out I left her
appeased. So to Whitehall, where I found Mr. Moore attending for me at
the Privy Seal, but nothing to do to-day. I went to my Lord St. Albans
lodgings, and found him in bed, talking to a priest (he looked like one)
that leaned along over the side of the bed, and there I desired to know
his mind about making the catch stay longer, which I got ready for him
the other day. He seems to be a fine civil gentleman. To my Lord's, and
did give up my audit of his accounts, which I had been then two days
about, and was well received by my Lord. I dined with my Lord and Lady,
and we had a venison pasty. Mr. Shepley and I went into London, and
calling upon Mr. Pinkney, the goldsmith, he took us to the tavern, and
gave us a pint of wine, and there fell into our company old Mr. Flower
and another gentleman; who tell us how a Scotch knight was killed basely
the other day at the Fleece in Covent Garden, where there had been a
great many formerly killed. So to Paul's Churchyard, and there I took
the little man at Mr. Kirton's and Mr. Shepley to Ringstead's at the
Star, and after a pint of wine I went home, my brains somewhat troubled
with so much wine, and after a letter or two by the post I went to bed.

2d (Lord's day). My head not very well, and my body out of order by last
night's drinking, which is my great folly. To church, and Mr. Mills made
a good sermon; so home to dinner. My wife and I all alone to a leg of
mutton, the sawce of which being made sweet, I was angry at it, and eat
none, but only dined upon the marrow bone that we had beside. To church
in the afternoon, and after sermon took Tom Fuller's Church History and
read over Henry the 8th's life in it, and so to supper and to bed.

3rd. This morning I took a resolution to rise early in the morning, and
so I rose by candle, which I have not done all this winter, and spent my
morning in fiddling till time to go to the office, where Sir G. Carteret
did begin again discourse on Mr. Holland's proposition, which the King
do take very ill, and so Sir George in lieu of that do propose that the
seamen should have half in ready money and tickets for the other half,
to be paid in three months after, which we judge to be very practicable.
After office home to dinner, where come in my cozen Snow by chance, and
I had a very good capon to dinner. So to the office till night, and so
home, and then come Mr. Davis, of Deptford (the first time that ever
he was at my house), and after him Mons. L'Impertinent, who is to go to
Ireland to-morrow, and so came to take his leave of me. They both found
me under the barber's hand; but I had a bottle of good sack in the
house, and so made them very welcome. Mr. Davis sat with me a good while
after the other was gone, talking of his hard usage and of the endeavour
to put him out of his place in the time of the late Commissioners, and
he do speak very highly of their corruption. After he was gone I fell
a reading 'Cornelianum dolium' till 11 o'clock at night with great
pleasure, and after that to bed.

4th. To Whitehall to Sir G. Carteret's chamber, where all the officers
met, and so we went up to the Duke of York, and he took us into his
closet, and we did open to him our project of stopping the growing
charge of the fleet by paying them in hand one moyety, and the other
four months hence. This he do like, and we returned by his order to Sir
G. Carteret's chamber, and there we did draw up this design in order to
be presented to the Parliament. From thence I to my Lord's, and dined
with him and told him what we had done to-day. Sir Tho. Crew dined with
my Lord to-day, and we were very merry with Mrs. Borfett, who dined
there still as she has always done lately. After dinner Sir Tho. and my
Lady to the Playhouse to see "The Silent Woman." I home by water, and
with Mr. Hater in my chamber all alone he and I did put this morning's
design into order, which being done I did carry it to Sir W. Batten,
where I found some gentlemen with him (Sir W. Pen among the rest pretty
merry with drink) playing at cards, and there I staid looking upon them
till one o'clock in the morning, and so Sir W. Pen and I went away,
and I to bed. This day the Parliament voted that the bodies of Oliver,
Ireton, Bradshaw, &c., should be taken up out of their graves in the
Abbey, and drawn to the gallows, and there hanged and buried under it:
which (methinks) do trouble me that a man of so great courage as he was,
should have that dishonour, though otherwise he might deserve it enough.

5th. This morning the Proposal which I wrote the last night I showed to
the officers this morning, and was well liked of, and I wrote it fair
for Sir. G. Carteret to show to the King, and so it is to go to the
Parliament. I dined at home, and after dinner I went to the new Theatre
and there I saw "The Merry Wives of Windsor" acted, the humours of the
country gentleman and the French doctor very well done, but the rest but
very poorly, and Sir J. Falstaffe t as bad as any. From thence to Mr.
Will. Montagu's chamber to have sealed some writings tonight between Sir
R. Parkhurst and myself about my Lord's L2000, but he not coming, I went
to my father's and there found my mother still ill of the stone, and
had just newly voided one, which she had let drop into the chimney, and
looked and found it to shew it me. From thence home and to bed.

6th. This morning some of the Commissioners of Parliament and Sir W.
Batten went to Sir G. Carteret's office here in town, and paid off the
Chesnut. I carried my wife to White Friars and landed her there, and
myself to Whitehall to the Privy Seal, where abundance of pardons to
seal, but I was much troubled for it because that there are no fees now
coming for them to me. Thence Mr. Moore and I alone to the Leg in King
Street, and dined together on a neat's tongue and udder. From thence
by coach to Mr. Crew's to my Lord, who told me of his going out of town
to-morrow to settle the militia in Huntingdonshire, and did desire me to
lay up a box of some rich jewels and things that there are in it, which
I promised to do. After much free discourse with my Lord, who tells me
his mind as to his enlarging his family, &c., and desiring me to look
him out a Master of the Horse and other servants, we parted. From thence
I walked to Greatorex (he was not within), but there I met with Mr.
Jonas Moore,

     [Jonas Moore was born at Whitley, Lancashire, February 8th, 1617,
     and was appointed by Charles I. tutor to the Duke of York.  Soon
     after the Restoration he was knighted and made Surveyor-General of
     the Ordnance.  He was famous as a mathematician, and was one of the
     founders of the Royal Society.  He died August 27th, 1679, and at
     his funeral sixty pieces of ordnance were discharged at the Tower.]

and took him to the Five Bells,' and drank a glass of wine and left him.
To the Temple, when Sir R. Parkhurst (as was intended the last night)
did seal the writings, and is to have the L2000 told to-morrow. From,
thence by water to Parliament Stairs, and there at an alehouse to Doling
(who is suddenly to go into Ireland to venture his fortune); Simonds
(who is at a great loss for L200 present money, which I was loth to let
him have, though I could now do it, and do love him and think him honest
and sufficient, yet lothness to part with money did dissuade me from
it); Luellin (who was very drowsy from a dose that he had got the last
night), Mr. Mount and several others, among the rest one Mr. Pierce,
an army man, who did make us the best sport for songs and stories in
a Scotch tone (which he do very well) that ever I heard in my life. I
never knew so good a companion in all my observation. From thence to
the bridge by water, it being a most pleasant moonshine night, with
a waterman who did tell such a company of bawdy stories, how once he
carried a lady from Putney in such a night as this, and she bade him lie
down by her, which he did, and did give her content, and a great deal
more roguery. Home and found my girl knocking at the door (it being 11
o'clock at night), her mistress having sent her out for some trivial
business, which did vex me when I came in, and so I took occasion to go
up and to bed in a pet. Before I went forth this morning, one came to
me to give me notice that the justices of Middlesex do meet to-morrow
at Hicks Hall, and that I as one am desired to be there, but I fear I
cannot be there though I much desire it.

7th. This morning the judge Advocate Fowler came to see me, and he and
I sat talking till it was time to go to the office. To the office and
there staid till past 12 o'clock, and so I left the Comptroller and
Surveyor and went to Whitehall to my Lord's, where I found my Lord gone
this morning to Huntingdon, as he told me yesterday he would. I staid
and dined with my Lady, there being Laud the page's mother' there, and
dined also with us, and seemed to have been a very pretty woman and of
good discourse. Before dinner I examined Laud in his Latin and found him
a very pretty boy and gone a great way in Latin. After dinner I took a
box of some things of value that my Lord had left for me to carry to the
Exchequer, which I did, and left them with my Brother Spicer, who also
had this morning paid L1000 for me by appointment to Sir R. Parkhurst.
So to the Privy Seal, where I signed a deadly number of pardons, which
do trouble me to get nothing by. Home by water, and there was much
pleased to see that my little room is likely to come to be finished
soon. I fell a-reading Fuller's History of Abbys, and my wife in Great
Cyrus till twelve at night, and so to bed.

8th. To Whitehall to the Privy Seal, and thence to Mr. Pierces the
Surgeon to tell them that I would call by and by to go to dinner. But I
going into Westminster Hall met with Sir G. Carteret and Sir W. Pen (who
were in a great fear that we had committed a great error of L100,000 in
our late account gone into the Parliament in making it too little), and
so I was fain to send order to Mr. Pierces to come to my house; and also
to leave the key of the chest with Mr. Spicer; wherein my Lord's money
is, and went along with Sir W. Pen by water to the office, and there
with Mr. Huchinson we did find that we were in no mistake. And so I
went to dinner with my wife and Mr. and Mrs. Pierce the Surgeon to Mr.
Pierce, the Purser (the first time that ever I was at his house) who
does live very plentifully and finely. We had a lovely chine of beef and
other good things very complete and drank a great deal of wine, and her
daughter played after dinner upon the virginals,

     [All instruments of the harpsichord and spinet kind were styled
     virginals.]

and at night by lanthorn home again, and Mr. Pierce and his wife being
gone home I went to bed, having drunk so much wine that my head was
troubled and was not very well all night, and the wind I observed was
rose exceedingly before I went to bed.

9th (Lord's day). Being called up early by Sir W. Batten I rose and went
to his house and he told me the ill news that he had this morning from
Woolwich, that the Assurance (formerly Captain Holland's ship, and now
Captain Stoakes's, designed for Guiny and manned and victualled), was by
a gust of wind sunk down to the bottom. Twenty men drowned. Sir Williams
both went by barge thither to see how things are, and I am sent to the
Duke of York to tell him, and by boat with some other company going to
Whitehall from the Old Swan. I went to the Duke. And first calling upon
Mr. Coventry at his chamber, I went to the Duke's bed-side, who had sat
up late last night, and lay long this morning, who was much surprised,
therewith. This being done I went to chappell, and sat in Mr. Blagrave's
pew, and there did sing my part along with another before the King, and
with much ease. From thence going to my Lady I met with a letter from
my Lord (which Andrew had been at my house to bring me and missed me),
commanding me to go to Mr. Denham, to get a man to go to him to-morrow
to Hinchinbroke, to contrive with him about some alterations in his
house, which I did and got Mr. Kennard. Dined with my Lady and staid all
the afternoon with her, and had infinite of talk of all kind of things,
especially of beauty of men and women, with which she seems to be much
pleased to talk of. From thence at night to Mr. Kennard and took him to
Mr. Denham, the Surveyor's. Where, while we could not speak with him,
his chief man (Mr. Cooper) did give us a cup of good sack. From thence
with Mr. Kennard to my Lady who is much pleased with him, and after a
glass of sack there; we parted, having taken order for a horse or two
for him and his servant to be gone to-morrow. So to my father's, where
I sat while they were at supper, and I found my mother below, stairs
and pretty well. Thence home, where I hear that the Comptroller had some
business with me, and (with Giffin's lanthorn) I went to him and there
staid in discourse an hour 'till late, and among other things he showed
me a design of his, by the King's making an Order of Knights of the Seal
to give an encouragement for persons of honour to undertake the service
of the sea, and he had done it with great pains and very ingeniously. So
home and to prayers and to bed.

10th. Up exceedingly early to go to the Comptroller, but he not being
up and it being a very fine, bright, moonshine morning I went and walked
all alone twenty turns in Cornhill, from Gracious Street corner to the
Stockes and back again, from 6 o'clock till past 7, so long that I was
weary, and going to the Comptroller's thinking to find him ready, I
found him gone, at which I was troubled, and being weary went home,
and from thence with my wife by water to Westminster, and put her to my
father Bowyer's (they being newly come out of the country), but I could
not stay there, but left her there. I to the Hall and there met with
Col. Slingsby. So hearing that the Duke of York is gone down this
morning, to see the ship sunk yesterday at Woolwich, he and I returned
by his coach to the office, and after that to dinner. After dinner he
came to me again and sat with me at my house, ands among other discourse
he told me that it is expected that the Duke will marry the Lord
Chancellor's daughter at last which is likely to be the ruin of Mr.
Davis and my Lord Barkley, who have carried themselves so high against
the Chancellor; Sir Chas. Barkley swearing that he and others had lain
with her often, which all believe to be a lie. He and I in the evening
to the Coffee House in Cornhill, the first time that ever I was there,
and I found much pleasure in it, through the diversity of company and
discourse. Home and found my wife at my Lady Batten's, and have made a
bargain to go see the ship sunk at Woolwich, where both the Sir Williams
are still since yesterday, and I do resolve to go along with them. From
thence home and up to bed, having first been into my study, and to ease
my mind did go to cast up how my cash stands, and I do find as near as I
can that I am worth in money clear L240, for which God be praised. This
afternoon there was a couple of men with me with a book in each of their
hands, demanding money for pollmoney,

     [Pepys seems to have been let off very easily, for, by Act of
     Parliament 18 Car. II. cap. I (1666), servants were to pay one
     shilling in the pound of their wages, and others from one shilling
     to three shillings in the pound.]

and I overlooked the book and saw myself set down Samuel Pepys, gent.
10s. for himself and for his servants 2s., which I did presently pay
without any dispute, but I fear I have not escaped so, and therefore
I have long ago laid by L10 for them, but I think I am not bound to
discover myself.

11th. My wife and I up very early this day, and though the weather was
very bad and the wind high, yet my Lady Batten and her maid and we two
did go by our barge to Woolwich (my Lady being very fearfull) where we
found both Sir Williams and much other company, expecting the weather
to be better, that they might go about weighing up the Assurance,
which lies there (poor ship, that I have been twice merry in, in Captn.
Holland's time,) under water, only the upper deck may be seen and the
masts. Captain Stoakes is very melancholy, and being in search for some
clothes and money of his, which he says he hath lost out of his cabin.
I did the first office of a justice of Peace to examine a seaman
thereupon, but could find no reason to commit him. This last tide the
Kingsale was also run aboard and lost her mainmast, by another ship,
which makes us think it ominous to the Guiny voyage, to have two of
her ships spoilt before they go out. After dinner, my Lady being very
fearfull she staid and kept my wife there, and I and another gentleman,
a friend of Sir W. Pen's, went back in the barge, very merry by the
way, as far as Whitehall in her. To the Privy Seal, where I signed
many pardons and some few things else. From thence Mr. Moore and I into
London to a tavern near my house, and there we drank and discoursed of
ways how to put out a little money to the best advantage, and at present
he has persuaded me to put out L250 for L50 per annum for eight years,
and I think I shall do it. Thence home, where I found the wench washing,
and I up to my study, and there did make up an even L100, and sealed it
to lie by. After that to bed.

12th. Troubled with the absence of my wife. This morning I went (after
the Comptroller and I had sat an hour at the office) to Whitehall
to dine with my Lady, and after dinner to the Privy Seal and sealed
abundance of pardons and little else. From thence to the Exchequer and
did give my mother Bowyer a visit and her daughters, the first time that
I have seen them since I went last to sea. From thence up with J. Spicer
to his office and took L100, and by coach with it as far as my father's,
where I called to see them, and my father did offer me six pieces of
gold, in lieu of six pounds that he borrowed of me the other day, but
it went against me to take it of him and therefore did not, though I was
afterwards a little troubled that I did not. Thence home, and took out
this L100 and sealed it up with the other last night, it being the first
L200 that ever I saw together of my own in my life. For which God be
praised. So to my Lady Batten, and sat an hour or two, and talked with
her daughter and people in the absence of her father and mother and my
wife to pass away the time. After that home and to bed, reading myself
asleep, while the wench sat mending my breeches by my bedside.

13th. All the day long looking upon my workmen who this day began to
paint my parlour. Only at noon my Lady Batten and my wife came home,
and so I stepped to my Lady's, where were Sir John Lawson and Captain
Holmes, and there we dined and had very good red wine of my Lady's own
making in England.

14th. Also all this day looking upon my workmen. Only met with the
Comptroller at the office a little both forenoon and afternoon, and at
night step a little with him to the Coffee House where we light upon
very good company and had very good discourse concerning insects and
their having a generative faculty as well as other creatures. This
night in discourse the Comptroller told me among other persons that were
heretofore the principal officers of the Navy, there was one Sir Peter
Buck, a Clerk of the Acts, of which to myself I was not a little proud.

15th. All day at home looking upon my workmen, only at noon Mr. Moore
came and brought me some things to sign for the Privy Seal and dined
with me. We had three eels that my wife and I bought this morning of
a man, that cried them about, for our dinner, and that was all I did
to-day.

16th. In the morning to church, and then dined at home. In the afternoon
I to White Hall, where I was surprised with the news of a plot against
the King's person and my Lord Monk's; and that since last night there
are about forty taken up on suspicion; and, amongst others, it was my
lot to meet with Simon Beale, the Trumpeter, who took me and Tom Doling
into the Guard in Scotland Yard, and showed us Major-General Overton,
where I heard him deny that he is guilty of any such things; but that
whereas it is said that he is found to have brought many arms to town,
he says it is only to sell them, as he will prove by oath. From thence
with Tom Doling and Boston and D. Vines (whom we met by the way) to
Price's, and there we drank, and in discourse I learnt a pretty trick to
try whether a woman be a maid or no, by a string going round her head to
meet at the end of her nose, which if she be not will come a great way
beyond. Thence to my Lady's and staid with her an hour or two talking of
the Duke of York and his lady, the Chancellor's daughter, between whom,
she tells me, that all is agreed and he will marry her. But I know not
how true yet. It rained hard, and my Lady would have had me have the
coach, but I would not, but to my father's, where I met my wife, and
there supped, and after supper by link home and to bed.

17th. All day looking after my workmen, only in the afternoon to the
office where both Sir Williams were come from Woolwich, and tell us
that, contrary to their expectations, the Assurance is got up, without
much damage to her body, only to the goods that she hath within her,
which argues her to be a strong, good ship. This day my parlour is
gilded, which do please me well.

18th. All day at home, without stirring at all, looking after my
workmen.

19th. At noon I went and dined with my Lady at Whitehall, and so back
again to the office, and after that home to my workmen. This night Mr.
Gauden sent me a great chine of beef and half a dozen of tongues.

20th. All day at home with my workmen, that I may get all done before
Christmas. This day I hear that the Princess Royal has the small pox.

21st. By water to Whitehall (leaving my wife at Whitefriars going to my
father's to buy her a muff and mantle), there I signed many things at
the Privy Seal, and carried L200 from thence to the Exchequer, and laid
it up with Mr. Hales, and afterwards took him and W. Bowyer to the Swan
and drank with them. They told me that this is St. Thomas's [day], and
that by an old custom, this day the Exchequer men had formerly, and do
intend this night to have a supper; which if I could I promised to
come to, but did not. To my Lady's, and dined with her: she told me how
dangerously ill the Princess Royal is and that this morning she was said
to be dead. But she hears that she hath married herself to young
Jermyn, which is worse than the Duke of York's marrying the Chancellor's
daughter, which is now publicly owned. After dinner to the office all
the afternoon. At seven at night I walked through the dirt to Whitehall
to see whether my Lord be come to town, and I found him come and at
supper, and I supped with him. He tells me that my aunt at Brampton has
voided a great stone (the first time that ever I heard she was troubled
therewith) and cannot possibly live long, that my uncle is pretty well,
but full of pain still. After supper home and to bed.

22nd. All the morning with my painters, who will make an end of all this
day I hope. At noon I went to the Sun tavern; on Fish Street hill, to a
dinner of Captn. Teddimans, where was my Lord Inchiquin (who seems to be
a very fine person), Sir W. Pen, Captn. Cuttance, and one Mr. Lawrence
(a fine gentleman now going to Algiers), and other good company, where
we had a very fine dinner, good musique, and a great deal of wine. We
staid here very late, at last Sir W. Pen and I home together, he so
overcome with wine that he could hardly go; I was forced to lead him
through the streets and he was in a very merry and kind mood. I home
(found my house clear of the workmen and their work ended), my head
troubled with wine, and I very merry went to bed, my head akeing all
night.

23rd (Lord's day). In the morning to Church, where our pew all covered
with rosemary and baize. A stranger made a dull sermon. Home and found
my wife and maid with much ado had made shift to spit a great turkey
sent me this week from Charles Carter, my old colleague, now minister in
Huntingdonshire, but not at all roasted, and so I was fain to stay till
two o'clock, and after that to church with my wife, and a good sermon
there was, and so home. All the evening at my book, and so to supper and
to bed.

24th. In the morning to the office and Commissioner Pett (who seldom
comes there) told me that he had lately presented a piece of plate
(being a couple of flaggons) to Mr. Coventry, but he did not receive
them, which also put me upon doing the same too; and so after dinner
I went and chose a payre of candlesticks to be made ready for me at
Alderman Backwell's. To the office again in the afternoon till night,
and so home, and with the painters till 10 at night, making an end of my
house and the arch before my door, and so this night I was rid of them
and all other work, and my house was made ready against to-morrow being
Christmas day. This day the Princess Royal died at Whitehall.

25th (Christmas day). In the morning very much pleased to see my house
once more clear of workmen and to be clean, and indeed it is so, far
better than it was that I do not repent of my trouble that I have been
at. In the morning to church, where Mr. Mills made a very good sermon.
After that home to dinner, where my wife and I and my brother Tom (who
this morning came to see my wife's new mantle put on, which do please me
very well), to a good shoulder of mutton and a chicken. After dinner to
church again, my wife and I, where we had a dull sermon of a stranger,
which made me sleep, and so home, and I, before and after supper, to my
lute and Fuller's History, at which I staid all alone in my chamber till
12 at night, and so to bed.

26th. In the morning to Alderman Backwell's for the candlesticks for Mr.
Coventry, but they being not done I went away, and so by coach to Mr.
Crew's, and there took some money of Mr. Moore's for my Lord, and so to
my Lord's, where I found Sir Thomas Bond (whom I never saw before) with
a message from the Queen about vessells for the carrying over of her
goods, and so with him to Mr. Coventry, and thence to the office (being
soundly washed going through the bridge) to Sir Wm. Batten and Pen (the
last of whom took physic to-day), and so I went up to his chamber, and
there having made an end of the business I returned to White Hall by
water, and dined with my Lady Sandwich, who at table did tell me how
much fault was laid upon Dr. Frazer and the rest of the Doctors, for the
death of the Princess! My Lord did dine this day with Sir Henry Wright,
in order to his going to sea with the Queen. Thence to my father
Bowyer's where I met my wife, and with her home by water.

27th. In the morning to Alderman Backwell's again, where I found the
candlesticks done, and went along with him in his coach to my Lord's and
left the candlesticks with Mr. Shepley. I staid in the garden talking
much with my Lord, who do show me much of his love and do communicate
his mind in most things to me, which is my great content. Home and with
my wife to Sir W. Batten's to dinner, where much and good company. My
wife not very well went home, I staid late there seeing them play at
cards, and so home to bed. This afternoon there came in a strange lord
to Sir William Batten's by a mistake and enters discourse with him, so
that we could not be rid of him till Sir Arn. Breames and Mr. Bens and
Sir W. Pen fell a-drinking to him till he was drunk, and so sent him
away. About the middle of the night I was very ill--I think with eating
and drinking too much--and so I was forced to call the maid, who pleased
my wife and I in her running up and down so innocently in her smock,
and vomited in the bason, and so to sleep, and in the morning was pretty
well, only got cold, and so had pain.... as I used to have.

28th. Office day. There all the morning. Dined at home alone with my
wife, and so staid within all the afternoon and evening; at my lute,
with great pleasure, and so to bed with great content.

29th. Within all the morning. Several people to speak with me; Mr.
Shepley for L100; Mr. Kennard and Warren, the merchant, about deals for
my Lord. Captain Robert Blake lately come from the Straights about
some Florence Wine for my Lord, and with him I went to Sir W. Pen,
who offering me a barrel of oysters I took them both home to my house
(having by chance a good piece of roast beef at the fire for dinner),
and there they dined with me, and sat talking all the afternoon-good
company. Thence to Alderman Backwell's and took a brave state-plate and
cupp in lieu of the candlesticks that I had the other day and carried
them by coach to my Lord's and left them there. And so back to my
father's and saw my mother, and so to my uncle Fenner's, whither my
father came to me, and there we talked and drank, and so away; I home
with my father, he telling me what bad wives both my cozen Joyces
make to their husbands, which I much wondered at. After talking of my
sister's coming to me next week, I went home and to bed.

30th (Lord's day). Lay long in bed, and being up, I went with Will to
my Lord's, calling in at many churches in my way. There I found Mr.
Shepley, in his Venetian cap, taking physique in his chamber, and with
him I sat till dinner. My Lord dined abroad and my Lady in her chamber,
so Mr. Hetly, Child and I dined together, and after dinner Mr. Child and
I spent some time at the lute, and so promising to prick me some lessons
to my theorbo he went away to see Henry Laws, who lies very sick. I to
the Abby and walked there, seeing the great confusion of people that
come there to hear the organs. So home, calling in at my father's,
but staid not, my father and mother being both forth. At home I fell
a-reading of Fuller's Church History till it was late, and so to bed.

31st. At the office all the morning and after that home, and not staying
to dine I went out, and in Paul's Church-yard I bought the play of
"Henry the Fourth," and so went to the new Theatre (only calling at Mr.
Crew's and eat a bit with the people there at dinner) and saw it acted;
but my expectation being too great, it did not please me, as otherwise I
believe it would; and my having a book, I believe did spoil it a little.
That being done I went to my Lord's, where I found him private at cards
with my Lord Lauderdale and some persons of honour. So Mr. Shepley and
I over to Harper's, and there drank a pot or two, and so parted. My boy
taking a cat home with him from my Lord's, which Sarah had given him for
my wife, we being much troubled with mice. At Whitehall inquiring for a
coach, there was a Frenchman with one eye that was going my way, so he
and I hired the coach between us and he set me down in Fenchurch Street.
Strange how the fellow, without asking, did tell me all what he was, and
how he had ran away from his father and come into England to serve the
King, and now going back again. Home and to bed.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
