THE PROPHECY OF NAHUM

NAHUM, whose name signifies A COMFORTER, was a native of Elcese, or
Elcesai, supposed to be a little town in Galilee. He prophesied, after
the ten tribes were carried into captivity, and foretold the utter
destruction of Ninive, by the Babylonians and Medes: which happened in
the reign of JOSIAS.


Nahum Chapter 1

The majesty of God, his goodness to his people, and severity to his
enemies.

1:1. The burden of Ninive. The book of the vision of Nahum, the
Elcesite.

1:2. The Lord is a jealous God, and a revenger: the Lord is a revenger,
and hath wrath: the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he is
angry with his enemies.

1:3. The Lord is patient, and great in power, and will not cleanse and
acquit the guilty. The Lord's ways are in a tempest, and a whirlwind,
and clouds are the dust of his feet.

1:4. He rebuketh the sea and drieth it up: and bringeth all the rivers
to be a desert. Basan languisheth and Carmel: and the flower of Libanus
fadeth away.

1:5. The mountains tremble at him, and the hills are made desolate: and
the earth hath quaked at his presence, and the world, and all that dwell
therein.

1:6. Who can stand before the face of his indignation? and who shall
resist in the fierceness of his anger? his indignation is poured out
like fire: and the rocks are melted by him.

1:7. The Lord is good, and giveth strength in the day of trouble: and
knoweth them that hope in him.

1:8. But with a flood that passeth by, he will make an utter end of the
place thereof: and darkness shall pursue his enemies.

Of the place thereof... Viz., of Ninive.

1:9. What do ye devise against the Lord? he will make an utter end:
there shall not rise a double affliction.

1:10. For as thorns embrace one another: so while they are feasting and
drinking together, they shall be consumed as stubble that is fully dry.

1:11. Out of thee shall come forth one that imagineth evil against the
Lord, contriving treachery in his mind.

Shall come forth one, etc... Some understand this of Sennacherib. But as
his attempt against the people seems to have been prior to the prophecy
of Nahum, we may better understand it of Holofernes.

1:12. Thus saith the Lord: Though they were perfect: and many of them
so, yet thus shall they be cut off, and he shall pass: I have afflicted
thee, and I will afflict thee no more.

Though they were perfect, etc... That is, however strong or numerous
their forces may be, they shall be cut off; and their prince or leader
shall pass away and disappear.

1:13. And now I will break in pieces his rod with which he struck thy
back, and I will burst thy bonds asunder.

1:14. And the Lord will give a commandment concerning thee, that no more
of thy name shall be sown: I will destroy the graven and molten thing
out of the house of thy God, I will make it thy grave, for thou art
disgraced.

Will give a commandment... That is, a decree, concerning thee, O king of
Ninive, thy seed shall fail, etc.

1:15. Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
tidings, and that preacheth peace: O Juda, keep thy festivals, and pay
thy vows: for Belial shall no more pass through thee again, he is
utterly cut off.

Belial... The wicked one, viz., the Assyrian.

Nahum Chapter 2

God sends his armies against Ninive to destroy it.

2:1. He is come up that shall destroy before thy face, that shall keep
the siege: watch the way, fortify thy loins, strengthen thy power
exceedingly.

2:2. For the Lord hath rendered the pride of Jacob, as the pride of
Israel: because the spoilers have laid them waste, and have marred their
vine branches.

Hath rendered the pride of Jacob, etc... He hath punished Jacob for his
pride; and therefore Ninive must not expect to escape. Or else,
rendering the pride of Jacob means rewarding, that is, punishing Ninive
for the pride they exercised against Jacob.

2:3. The shield of his mighty men is like fire, the men of the army are
clad in scarlet, the reins of the chariot are flaming in the day of his
preparation, and the drivers are stupified.

Of his mighty men, etc... He speaks of the Chaldeans and Medes sent to
destroy Ninive.-Ibid. Stupefied... consopiti. That is, they drive on
furiously like men intoxicated with wine.

2:4. They are in confusion in the ways, the chariots jostle one against
another in the streets: their looks are like torches, like lightning
running to and fro.

2:5. He will muster up his valiant men, they shall stumble in their
march: they shall quickly get upon the walls thereof: and a covering
shall be prepared.

Stumble in their march... By running hastily on.

2:6. The gates of the rivers are opened, and the temple is thrown down
to the ground.

2:7. And the soldier is led away captive: and her bondwomen were led
away mourning as doves, murmuring in their hearts.

2:8. And as for Ninive, her waters are like a great pool: but the men
flee away. They cry: Stand, stand, but there is none that will return
back.

2:9. Take ye the spoil of the silver, take the spoil of the gold: for
there is no end of the riches of all the precious furniture.

2:10. She is destroyed, and rent, and torn: the heart melteth, and the
knees fail, and all the loins lose their strength: and the faces of them
all are as the blackness of a kettle.

2:11. Where is now the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of
the young lions, to which the lion went, to enter in thither, the young
lion, and there was none to make them afraid?

2:12. The lion caught enough for his whelps, and killed for his
lionesses: and he filled his holes with prey, and his den with rapine.

2:13. Behold I come against thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will
burn thy chariots even to smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young
lions: and I will cut off thy prey out of the land, and the voice of thy
messengers shall be heard no more.

Nahum Chapter 3

The miserable destruction of Ninive.

3:1. Woe to thee, 0 city of blood, all full of lies and violence: rapine
shall not depart from thee.

3:2. The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels,
and of the neighing horse; and of the running chariot, and of the
horsemen coming up,

3:3. And of the shining sword, and of the glittering spear, and of a
multitude slain, and of a grievous destruction: and there is no end of
carcasses, and they shall fall down on their dead bodies.

3:4. Because of the multitude of the fornications of the harlot that was
beautiful and agreeable, and that made use of witchcraft, that sold
nations through her fornications, and families through her witchcrafts.

3:5. Behold I come against thee, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will
discover thy shame to thy face, and will shew thy nakedness to the
nations, and thy shame to kingdoms.

3:6. And I will cast abominations upon thee, and will disgrace thee, and
will make an example of thee.

3:7. And it shall come to pass that every one that shall see thee, shall
flee from thee, and shall say: Ninive is laid waste: who shall bemoan
thee? whence shall I seek a comforter for thee?

3:8. Art thou better than the populous Alexandria, that dwelleth among
the rivers? waters are round about it: the sea is its riches: the waters
are its walls.

Populous Alexandria... No-Ammon. A populous city of Egypt destroyed by
the Chaldeans, and afterwards rebuilt by Alexander, and called
Alexandria. Others suppose No-Ammon to be the same as Diospolis.

3:9. Ethiopia and Egypt were the strength thereof, and there is no end:
Africa and the Libyans were thy helpers.

3:10. Yet she also was removed and carried into cap-tivity: her young
children were dashed in pieces at the top of every street, and they cast
lots upon her nobles, and all her great men were bound in fetters.

3:11. Therefore thou also shalt be made drunk, and shalt be despised:
and thou shalt seek help from the enemies.

3:12. All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with their green
figs: if they be shaken, they shall fall into the mouth of the eater.

3:13. Behold thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of thy
land shall be set wide open to thy enemies, the fire shall devour thy
bars.

3:14. Draw thee water for the siege, build up thy bulwarks: go into the
clay, and tread, work it and make brick.

3:15. There shall the fire devour thee: thou shalt perish by the sword,
it shall devour thee like the bruchus: assemble together like the
bruchus, make thyself many like the locust.

3:16. Thou hast multiplied thy merchandises above the stars of heaven:
the bruchus hath spread himself and flown away.

3:17. Thy guards are like the locusts: and thy little ones like the
locusts of locusts which swarm on the hedges in the day of cold: the sun
arose, and they flew away, and their place was not known where they
were.

Locusts of locusts... The young locusts.

3:18. Thy shepherds have slumbered, O king of Assyria, thy princes shall
be buried: thy people are hid in the mountains, and there is none to
gather them.

3:19. Thy destruction is not hidden, thy wound is grievous: all that
have heard the fame of thee, have clapped their hands over thee: for
upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
