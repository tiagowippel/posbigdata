POPULAR PHILOSOPHY

  Dommy









1.Better to be a willing servant to our mind than an unwilling slave to a
tyrant?s will.

2.The physical self and mind as willing servants to a worthy cause is a form
of devotion. The physical self and mind as unwilling slaves to a despised
cause is physical and spiritual violation.

3.Controlled freedom is externally induced refrain, discretion and
responsibility .It is only when we are given the sovereignty of freewill do we
realise our susceptibility and vulnerability.

4.If a soothsayer predicts negative events in our lives, use freewill to avoid
them. If a soothsayer predicts positive events in our lives ,use  freewill to
fulfil them.

5.We should all generate our own knowledge not just absorb all that we have
learned. In order to attain our full intellectual potential ,we need both the
scholar and innovator in us.

6.When at last we realise how much we?ve lost when things have passed, we
have grasped both wisdom and folly.

7.A pessimist is plagued by dark vision. An optimist is embraced by clear
hope .A practical realist has both dark vision and clear hope .

8.Sweeping statements are uninsured ventures offering high risks of
swallowing our words and pride.

9.The course of one?s life is like a quest for a masterpiece. It hinges on just
the right intensity and apt strokes.

10.The best we thought we were at earlier times are sometimes not as good as
the best stage we are at now. Being at one?s best depends on the time scale it
is judged on. We peak differently at different times. All our peak points are
the summits of their own time.

11.A mortal fact here : Those who live within the century they were born in
and never get to see the next or those  fortunate enough to see the next.

12.Clich�s that we cannot do without are not clich�s but language essentials.

13.Anxiety to the mind is akin to a fractured leg to the body.

14.To maintain constant levels of alertness, for the prolific mind ; repose
while for the sedentary mind ; stimulation.

15.Moderate amounts of guidelines in convention and etiquette ensures that
civilization behaves in civil fashion. Excessive amounts of convention and
etiquette converts life into ritualistic enslavement of thought and action.

16.If you don?t know nothing you know something.

17.One insists because of truth. One insists because of prejudice.

18.Experience is when something becomes easier, more predictable with less
surprises with our ability to discern those worth cherishing and those
only worth  during their fleeting hour.

19.Innovation may spell the demise of erstwhile techniques which were
innovations of yesteryears or just muffle them. The possibility of revamps,
revivals cannot be overruled entirely be they in similar, related or different
fields of interest. Nostalgia has its charms.

20.In order to be profound in thoughts the mind must be liberated from the
immediate reality of trifles.

21.The inexperienced and strong pour all their power to complete a task.
     The experienced and not as strong place their power where it?s needed.

22.There are those who are weak with strong will and those strong with
     weak will.

23.Sharing is to be aware that we are not the absolute owner and to attune
ourselves to the pendulum cycle of holding and releasing.

24.Communication isn?t confined to mere expression. Communication
involves discretion and sensitivity as well to connotations and subtleties.

25.A wizened head is not necessarily a wise one, vice-versa.

26.To be educated with what we know and to expect them in a particular
form only is to be unprepared for exceptions.

27.Innovation brings changes to lifestyle , technology and attitude too.

28.To be comfortable with Falsehood is to be uneasy with Truth.

29.If conventional methods bind us  in a knot , let innovation undo it.

30.If conformity fills the world, inventiveness shapes it.

31.If conformity follows the charted course, innovation plots it.

32.Tradition is a method to get fledglings and elders involved. For a while,
regardless of seniority ,they are united by a common cause.

33.Daring, recklessness and folly are discerned by the odds, rational thought
and degree of desperation.

34.Observe interests before resolving the conflict.

35.Meet your Maker with readiness and anticipation , honour and humility ,
knowledge and receptiveness ,forgiveness in soul , remorse for vices , joy for
virtues and devoted willingness to be of service to the Omnipotent.

36.Some interpretations of morality and immorality change as humanity
evolves while the absolutes remain.

37.We labour for ourselves and for others.

38.Trends are variants and possibilities. They dock at the harbours of fashion
and drift away to the sea of pass�. From obscurity sometimes they do return.
Direction lies not there. Direction lies in rudiments upon which trends were
moulded.

39.Unbridled discerning divides us.

40.To know much of everything is extraordinary. To know much of
something or someone is a common norm.

41.Most of the time a-know-it-all is a know-less-than-all.

42.Having just adequate knowledge to exist is like being familiar with our
own dwelling. But once outside ,we become ignorant strangers.

43.Let us live and understand not just mere pride from knowing about things.

44.Search within and discover that
...we know more than we think
...we know less than we think
...we are less than what we think we are
..we are greater than what we think we are

45.It is a terrible affliction to underestimate and overestimate ourselves
frequently.

46.An identical replacement should be deemed as such without undue
expectations for it to resemble or be what was lost or unattainable. To have a
substitute subjected to endless comparisons brings agony and disillusionment.

47.Withholding, releasing, utilising and non utilising  information exacerbates
or brings peace.

48.To shape one?s own methods and principles , observe others. From that
emerges one?s identity with tolerance and understanding of others.

49.The best way to honour and cherish is to treasure and remember it at its
finest.

50.It is great to be flawlessly felicitous for the moment. It is greater to be
relevant always.

51.Blood is the fluid of life. Water is the fluid for sustaining life.

52.Two options to attain greatness and awareness. One, through conspicuous
actions .Two, through inconspicuous means.

53.We  realise mistakes
...while it?s been made
...after it has been made
...after been informed
...after admonishment
...after  been criticised
...after its consequences have befallen us
...before its occurrence

54.Acknowledgement comes while we are here or when we have left.

55.Opportunity is not a one way traffic flow. There are times when others and
events create opportunities for us. In our time of need, magnanimity ,
obligation or circumstantial twists of events, we create opportunities for
others.

56.Having an interest in a certain subject covers more than academic pursuits.
Practical pursuits come to play too. It can be a possession of something with
the potential to augment progress in a particular sector or more.

57.Interest may lead to growth or decline, conception or doom to those
affected.

58.When we realise that we are misfits in other matters, console ourselves
with our strengths.


59.It is not easy being a perfectionist. The mind has to live up with the
demands of the heart?s desire, the form has to toil while the conscience has to
answer whether to live with a flaw or eradicate it even if it means more effort.
The restless heart searches constantly for improvement. The final attainment
and result of work is left for the perfectionist to regard it as worth every iota
of distress, sacrifice , struggle and rumination invested or else the set up is
undone and rebuilt again.

60.Thinking is the means of marshalling our dormant memory, facts , ideas
and dreams while we coax them to form a cohesive logical fluxion.

61.Endurance and Faith are required in the advance into uncertainty for they
are our defiant impetus of resistance which pit against tempting surrender.

62.Rational judgment and discretion are imperative in an age when sources of
knowledge provide contradictory accounts. It aids those who are bemused
and buried in the quagmire of indecision.

63.Seekers seek for
...the purpose of conquering
...the purpose of cherishing
...for the sake of seeking
...in order to destroy


64.Bellicose seekers will be met with opposition while the one who comes in
peace will be greeted with cooperation.

65.Public opinion is what society considers you to be. Reputation is what you
have done to enable associates , rivals and strangers  to consider you to be.
Self-esteem is what you consider yourself to be .

66.Artists create
...what they think the public want  .... for the joys of creating
...what they think that the public should see ... according to their whims
...exactly what the public want ... or things which will invite controversy
...for the sake of creating  ... for the sake of their sanity.


67.It is much easier to yearn and possess than to cherish and preserve.

68.WHAT CAUSES CONFLICT ?
Differing points of view and no middle road for both to tread.

69.Actions are impulses and thoughts brought to the physical realm.

70.Curb fears that immobilise us. Value and harness those which mobilise us.

71.Sometimes the way to peace is to just accept the state of things.

72.The ability to adapt, learn , to be adept and improvise are methods  used
for mastering situations .The ability to amass possibilities are methods of
altering or avoiding situations in which we were cast in.

73.We may not welcome old age yet we ought to welcome wisdom from
experience.

74.Among us are those who treasure their childhood and wish to be children
and innocent. There are those who treasure adulthood .There are those willing
to remain in the world of adolescent joys and pain.

75.Be calm if one is as wise as one ought to be.
    Fear not if one is wiser too.
    Fear when one is less than one ought to be.


76.Situations influence our mood. We cannot deny that our moods do exist.
We are all moody people.

77.Fear for yourself and for others if you have no control over destructive
impulses.

78.A perfectionist can be one who demands perfection from oneself and/or
from others. Demands for perfection may be constant or occasional , realistic
or otherwise while dealing with human or technological limitations .


79.Swearing to keep secrets is easy. To refrain ourselves from disclosing is
the challenge.

80.Sometimes it is the average  person with common sense who puts things
right not experts weighed down by their theories and principles.

81.It is easy to disclose a secret. It is hard to live with the fact of having done
so.

82.Past brushes with fright make either the coward or the brave.

83.The make does not make a person.

84.There are times when changes appear to threaten our plans. They are
sometimes inevitable. At times it is our less than perfect ideals which are
threatened and to alter them will be to our advantage later.

85.Better to transform faces of the present and deal with the tide of
approaching time than undo an established past .

86.Truth can be blurred but its persistence ensures that its implications will
not be shrouded indefinitely. Truth outlives schemers .

87.Deny truth and believe delusions. Deny truth and be hounded by its
legitimacy .Deny truth but later come to terms with it.

88.We retain the exterior and keep the core  vice-versa .
     Keep both core and exterior or discard both for new.

89.If one searches and discovers common links in the mesh of basic
principles , dissimilarity floats on the surface and similarity is submerged
below.

90.Conformity tries to cajole individuality to apologise for its uniqueness.

91.If our expressions  of individuality in no way transgress human laws or
God?s ,there is no basis to demand for a renouncement or recant.


92.It is best that we allow not ourselves to be stunted by well worn methods
and well tried ways. Time will tell as to when we are secure and confident
enough to venture out from the narrow sphere.

93.If you have been spared certain labour, use the time allocated to your
leisure for self evaluation and elevation .

94.It is not adequate to just grow wiser. Disseminate your work so others
may derive the same joys as well.

95.The question is laid to every person. Will one travel along the lighted or
darkened passage ?

96.Sense of duty comes in various forms. Whatever the preference or nature
the end is for some benefit.

97.Society tends to consider us...
...too much of certain things too little of others
...capable of certain things incapable of others
...knowledgeable of some and ignorant of certain  things
...should be certain things and not be others
...apt for some and inappropriate for others
...too early for certain things too late for others
...just about right for some others.

98.Desire, goals and interest are among those which have another in place
when fulfilled.

99.It takes varying doses of effort to end below, equal to or grander than  the
manner in which we have started.

100. Biological and mental  age has a bearing towards our ambitions and
enthusiasm not just the environment. One extract does not make a compound.

101.Philosophy is the sum of experience and knowledge  regarding a matter
or a scope of matters compressed into blocks of wisdom or expressed in a full
length treatise form.

102.What seems to be the start or the end may turn out to be a brief term ,
long term or perpetual existence of a state.

103.The measure of courage is based on the manner in which we confront the
actual event or how one comes to grips with the outcome.

104.We know that we have become more discerning in taste when we are
more selective, are no longer smitten or persuaded by one of its elements .
We appreciate the entirety.

105.If  what that has been expressed does not correspond with what has been
done, language is unnecessary and superfluous.

106.When one has nothing to say it is time to reflect on that state of
emptiness.

107.There are those who want to prove themselves. There are those who
never wanted to. There are  those without the chance to do so. There are
those who have done so. There are those who go on until enough has been
done .

108.There are
...those who are not
...those who want to be
...those who do not want to
...those who will never be
...those who will be
...those who think they are
...those trying to be
...those who nearly are
...those who are

109.Banalities are the light and mundane touches to life. They do not make
the larger picture but they assist in completing it.

110.Sleep?s a cure and a disease.
	Sleep?s a necessity and an addiction.
	Sleep?s a willing servant and a temptor.
	Sleep clears the mind and muddles the head.

111.What we perceive as tools of leisure are another?s tools of trade.

112.There are people. There are names. We are known by them. We build
them, we besmirch them. We create and alter them. We are proud or
embarrassed of them. We remember or forget them. We honour, ridicule,
criticise or dishonour them. We play with them, use, abuse and share them.

113.To be fearful and survive, to have confronted countless deaths and lived,
breeds strength and calm nurtured by mastery of terror and vulnerability.

114.Victory and euphoria by itself is ephemeral. The spoils and the future
matter more.

115.At times we have to clear the conscience that we have expended our
most fervent efforts.

116.Sometimes the passage to comprehension is to derive first hand
experience. Sometimes it is done through other sources. In any method,
dedication is vital.

117.When there?s madness there?s chaos and consequences.
	When there is craving there is desire.
	When there?s madness and desire there breeds frenzy and obsession.
	 Reality is lost.

118.When there is a dream there is a drive. Where there are principles you
can find conviction. When there is dedication there is responsibility. Where
there is consideration, there breeds caution and care. There is a sense of
reality.



119.Be one?s life prominent or inconspicuous, hectic or laid back, complex or
simple, matters not. Whether one sees the pattern of occurrence and truth
matters.

120.A power failure is a bright flash which put us in the dark.

121.It is personal opinion which must be curtailed for fair judgment. Only
those who laud or maul know the extent of their personal opinions in their
judgment.

122.Those who appreciate most are those who understand best.

123.The world is a hive of variety and we beings of variety.

124.Perspiration forms not only upon the brow of those who toil. The
anxious, fearful, industrious, weary, and relieved have the salt on them too.

125.If nothing is of importance , we would not take anything or be taken
seriously.

126.When the initial passion had waned, conviction with rational reason
sustain interest.

127.In order to atone for past misdeeds, at times, the peace offering comes
with a returned opportunity.

128.We back away to avoid involvement, back away to watch.
	We back away when threatened, back away when instinct tells us.
	We back away when it?s time to leave, when we care enough for
	another to manage on their own.

129.You have to be either strong or weak enough to turn your back from
something.

130.In most cases, it is poor perception that hinders, not physical impediment.


131.At the commencement, new findings come to us in abundance. At later
stages when a sizeable amount had been unearthed, they come at a slower
pace.

132.When we worry because of the dearth of things to ruminate on, we have
found a chunk to ponder on. Closest things at hand are too often disregarded.

133.We ought to be grateful for all the circumstances which enabled us to
attain and those which inspired us.

134.Choices are made according to varying mixtures of rational reasoning and
emotions.

135.To bear with resentment is difficult .To take our leave from its misery is
happy relief.

136.Repetition enhances appreciation and zeal or heightens annoyance and
aversion.

137.To keep is to impede or nurture. To keep is to destroy or preserve.

138.Awareness is not only exploring the inner self but the outer environment
as well.

139.We go in pursuit for many aims, to learn, to inflate the ego, to serve a
cause, to heighten the reputation, to capture, to treasure, to harm and to
protect.

140.There is cost involved in both victory and defeat.

141.What others think of us may or may not be what they thought of us
previously. What others think of us may or may not be what we think
ourselves to be.

142.From what we know, we can decrease or augment, deplete or replenish,
waste or retain, discourage or nurture , obliterate or create.


143.Whether one?s labours are rewarded with favour or spurned, whatever
the outcome, one ought to be consoled with the comfort that the execution of
our labours were made under the cover of probabilities and guided by clarity
of conscience.

144.Sometimes gestures and silence are the most apt communication.

145.Far better to give a sterling performance without an audience rather than
to an unappreciative one.

146.Where love resides there is a bond. Where there?s a bond it may not
always have love as company.

147.When love is no more, mutual respect and tolerance are left. When these
due to friction are depleted, parting is best.

148.Rage so long as it reigns, obscures profundity of all else but raging fever.

149.Our scars and hurt have tales to tell. They are part of the cost of living
and experience.

150.Faith is trust.

151.In the imperfect cosmos, enhancement of one feature comes with
depletion or sacrifice of another.

152.When we serve for gain or from generosity, we still have to put up with
some personal discomfort.

153.One stroke of a thread ferrying needle undoes a stitch. One potent stroke
of a drug carrying needle undoes a life.

154.If matters were simpler, there would be more trust, less elaborate
schemes and less reading between the lines.

155.If we view valid individualism and idiosyncrasies as unacceptable, then
being ourselves is tantamount to an illegal act.

156.At times scarcity and limitations bring about excellence.

157.Our passion indicates our commitment .How our passion consumes and
endures testify to the intensity of conviction.

159.It takes effort to create well, duplicate well and emulate well.

160.As we progress what were once seen as luxuries become necessities.

161.To be ennobled through age is a reward. To be debased in character as
we age is a shame.

162.No one relishes the ill mannered fledgling or elder.

163.We all play our part towards the well being of civilization.

164.When you fear yourself you will fear your own shadow.
       When you fear for yourself, you will also fear your own shadow.

165.There is order in disorder when feuding factions champion similar
causes.

166.There is pain and relief in both holding on and letting go.

167.For most, fantasy?s encroachment into reality is better received than
reality?s rude burst into fantasy.

168.Most would wish to stay with fond fantasies if there are no fond realities.
When and where there are fond realities to live with, there we shall stay.

169.It is not sufficient to have one?s facts precise but also to be sure of them
and ourselves.

170.In anger it is too easy to draw exaggerated stereotypical conclusions. It
takes sensitivity towards conscience and a vigorous spirit to resolve
objectively.

171.Circumstances and distractions make the weary and wary fair game.

172.Reality deals with what is. Fantasy deals with what might be even if it is
impossible.

173.There is dignity and greatness in the grand and humble. Our eyes need to
seek the less obvious for our minds to appreciate them.

174.The pace with which we go about our work manifest calm or alarm.

175.Being immersed in concentration is like tuning out in order to tune in.

176.We came here unsoiled. Our misdeeds soil us.

177.Our struggles wear us away, our passions invigorate us.

178.Society spares neither those who speak too much or those who speak
little.

179.A wrinkled brow should not be the price of temporary discomfort.

180.When we try overzealously to be proper in appearance and manners, we
at times overdo it to the extent that we end up apologising and blushing over
matters which are normal and natural.

181.Let?s face it, not all are compensated equally in material comforts for
their troubles.

182.The measure of strength is the volume of abuse which it is capable of
withstanding.

183.Some buckle under pressure , some buckle under excessive sweetness.

184.To see truth ,  we have to see through deceit.

185.One is charred by one?s torch when one is snuffed by the flame of one?s
passion.

186.There is the disquiet of unease in either knowing or not knowing.
      There is the ease of calm knowing and not knowing.

187.Confusion brings forth fear, fear brings forth confusion.

188.In a serious surrounding, we tune in with ease to  the significant. In a
mundane surrounding , we have to wait for revelations from banalities to
help us delve into significance.

189.There is a drive to action or to the brake of passivity when we are overly
anxious.

190.Familiarity tends to make us take things for granted while the unknown
cautions us .

191.By using our strength we can either do a lot of good or a lot of damage
to ourselves or to our surroundings.

192.We appreciate by preserving, devouring, using and by being careful.

193.Control is present in creation and destruction.

unorthodox quarters.

or at best a nagging mystery.

203.Be thankful for having both food and shelter during intemperate weather.

204.We forget about others while drunk in our own comforts and pleasures.

205.There are escape artists who perform stunts by liberating themselves
from danger. There are escape artists who perform stunts by shirking
responsibility.

206.We are given the option to etch our niche in humankind?s odyssey as
those who follow the paved path or as those who hacked their own.

207.Fiction is when one?s work is courted by reality and possibility, the
logical and illogical.

208.If you want a recital, ask for what one knows. If you wish to witness an
accomplishment, ask for what one can do with what one knows.

many.

of  experience or knowledge.

       Being able to tell the difference assures us of our sanity.

221.Wishing for the worst for others bares the worst in us.

222.To commit ourselves truly, it is best that we make as few pledges as
possible.

223.We mostly refrain from requesting assistance because of pride, taciturn
nature ,fear or over confidence .

224.Pride is forgotten when one is threatened or desperate.

225.When inspiring thoughts leave us ,  we lose the fervour. We are left with
tokens of achievement and the longing to achieve more.

226.Reverberating thoughts impede or propel.


227.Results are produced through depletion of renewable and non renewable
resources.

228.We are spent or revitalised when we give or derive.

229.We are all tied to strings of some sort. Some strings are longer, firmer
and more essential than some others.

230.Discretion is found in those with many priorities or in those who
understand subtleties of human ways.

231.An act of disregard can set the stage for a succession of similar misdeeds
because those in a position to rectify chose not to commit and instead

order to derive compact and representative generalisations .

248.The fire within heats us to action or burns us to oblivion.

249.Desperation heeds not reason, decorum or consent.

250.We criticise others well and convincingly. Can we do the same for
ourselves or will it take another to see the cracks on our crystal ?

251.When one is too enmeshed in light matters, serious matters become
heavy burdens.

252.Being out of touch from the familiar makes the return strange.

253.The superfluous are decorations built from the base of essentials.

oneself to necessities in boom times.

290.A sober approach to birthdays  is to consider them as a time for
reflection and resolution in place of common revelry.

291.Material with knowledge and wisdom. Material with knowledge
but without wisdom. Material which give neither.

292.Thought and conduct are fused as a singular entity in wisdom.

293.If one were to be blamed, be blamed for zeal?s abundance rather  than
the pathetic lack of it.

294.When one is a compulsive achiever, a person of accomplishment at an
earlier than usual phase, one is at a state whereby it would have taken others
a much longer time to grasp. For those who prefer to progress gradually ,
early achievement  is a remarkable  exception / anomaly.


295.Prudence makes us servants of our needs and anxiety.

297.The beginning of our affection is selfish and self-serving. At its maturity
our affection is such that sacrifice becomes a viable option for the welfare and
happiness of another.

298.We adapt , adopt and  emulate  in order to progress and as we progress.

299.We are pained at the point of release for we know what we shall miss.

detached states.

301.When we are unfamiliar with something, we review it  often so that we
can assimilate it in our minds and to accustom our thoughts with it.
When we are familiar with something we become well versed  enough to kid
around with it.

302.We were born as dots among masses. We try to leave as complete
sentences. Yet the length of our trail hangs heavily upon circumstances.

303.We may holler out loud. We may be heard by all. All comes to nought
till another answers the call.

304.Our tongues make things great and ordinary sound as they are or contrary
to their significance and nature.

305.Waiting can be brief respite from outcome or torment of outcome?s
uncertainty.

306.Vision to create a cause. Conviction to stay and Effort to pursue it.

307.Dissatisfaction fuels both beneficial and destructive effects.

308.Carbonated drink makers are a jolly lot. They are in a bubbly profession.

309.Critics whine, critics praise, critics appraise, critics condemn , critics
dismiss , critics ignore , critics avoid.

310.We complain of work which drain us and we complain of a lack of work.

311.We can say what we really wish to. What hinders our speech are
variables in circumstances and its retinue of effects .

312.We recall because there was a yesterday and it has passed.
       We do because we have today and it passes but once.
       We plan because we believe in tomorrow and it will come to pass.

313. It is the tempered soul that outlasts the fury of the pyre, the mortality of
the flesh, the vicissitudes of fancies, impermanence of favours, the narcissism
of vanity and the intransigence of factions. For awhile, and while it lasts, the
soul wears the godhead and inspiration, and it sees the wisdom withheld from
foolishness and the dues of virtues. How one wishes to have that crowning
wisdom, on the strength of our worthiness, unhindered by our most personal
and private of pitfalls.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
