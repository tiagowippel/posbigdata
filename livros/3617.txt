Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:

Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

NOTE:

Dumas's 'Celebrated Crimes' was not written for children.  The novelist
has spared no language--has minced no words--to describe the violent
scenes of a violent time.

In some instances facts appear distorted out of their true perspective,
and in others the author makes unwarranted charges.  It is not within our
province to edit the historical side of Dumas, any more than it would be
to correct the obvious errors in Dickens's Child's History of England.
The careful, mature reader, for whom the books are intended, will
recognize, and allow for, this fact.




INTRODUCTION:

The contents of these volumes of 'Celebrated Crimes', as well as the
motives which led to their inception, are unique.  They are a series
of stories based upon historical records, from the pen of Alexandre
Dumas, pere, when he was not "the elder," nor yet the author of
D'Artagnan or Monte Cristo, but was a rising young dramatist and a
lion in the literary set and world of fashion.

Dumas, in fact, wrote his 'Crimes Celebres' just prior to launching
upon his wonderful series of historical novels, and they may
therefore be considered as source books, whence he was to draw so
much of that far-reaching and intimate knowledge of inner history
which has perennially astonished his readers.  The Crimes were
published in Paris, in 1839-40, in eight volumes, comprising eighteen
titles--all of which now appear in the present carefully translated
text.  The success of the original work was instantaneous.  Dumas
laughingly said that he thought he had exhausted the subject of
famous crimes, until the work was off the press, when he immediately
became deluged with letters from every province in France, supplying
him with material upon other deeds of violence!  The subjects which
he has chosen, however, are of both historic and dramatic importance,
and they have the added value of giving the modern reader a clear
picture of the state of semi-lawlessness which existed in Europe,
during the middle ages.  "The Borgias, the Cenci, Urbain Grandier,
the Marchioness of Brinvilliers, the Marchioness of Ganges, and the
rest--what subjects for the pen of Dumas!" exclaims Garnett.

Space does not permit us to consider in detail the material here
collected, although each title will be found to present points of
special interest.  The first volume comprises the annals of the
Borgias and the Cenci.  The name of the noted and notorious
Florentine family has become a synonym for intrigue and violence, and
yet the Borgias have not been without stanch defenders in history.

Another famous Italian story is that of the Cenci.  The beautiful
Beatrice Cenci--celebrated in the painting of Guido, the sixteenth
century romance of Guerrazi, and the poetic tragedy of Shelley, not
to mention numerous succeeding works inspired by her hapless fate--
will always remain a shadowy figure and one of infinite pathos.

The second volume chronicles the sanguinary deeds in the south of
France, carried on in the name of religion, but drenching in blood
the fair country round about Avignon, for a long period of years.

The third volume is devoted to the story of Mary Queen of Scots,
another woman who suffered a violent death, and around whose name an
endless controversy has waged.  Dumas goes carefully into the dubious
episodes of her stormy career, but does not allow these to blind his
sympathy for her fate.  Mary, it should be remembered, was closely
allied to France by education and marriage, and the French never
forgave Elizabeth the part she played in the tragedy.

The fourth volume comprises three widely dissimilar tales.  One of
the strangest stories is that of Urbain Grandier, the innocent victim
of a cunning and relentless religious plot.  His story was dramatised
by Dumas, in 1850.  A famous German crime is that of Karl-Ludwig
Sand, whose murder of Kotzebue, Councillor of the Russian Legation,
caused an international upheaval which was not to subside for many
years.

An especially interesting volume is number six, containing, among
other material, the famous "Man in the Iron Mask."  This unsolved
puzzle of history was later incorporated by Dumas in one of the
D'Artagnan Romances a section of the Vicomte de Bragelonne, to which
it gave its name.  But in this later form, the true story of this
singular man doomed to wear an iron vizor over his features during
his entire lifetime could only be treated episodically.  While as a
special subject in the Crimes, Dumas indulges his curiosity, and that
of his reader, to the full.  Hugo's unfinished tragedy,'Les Jumeaux',
is on the same subject; as also are others by Fournier, in French,
and Zschokke, in German.

Other stories can be given only passing mention.  The beautiful
poisoner, Marquise de Brinvilliers, must have suggested to Dumas his
later portrait of Miladi, in the Three Musketeers, the mast
celebrated of his woman characters.  The incredible cruelties of Ali
Pacha, the Turkish despot, should not be charged entirely to Dumas,
as he is said to have been largely aided in this by one of his
"ghosts," Mallefille.

"Not a mere artist"--writes M. de Villemessant, founder of the
Figaro,--"he has nevertheless been able to seize on those dramatic
effects which have so much distinguished his theatrical career, and
to give those sharp and distinct reproductions of character which
alone can present to the reader the mind and spirit of an age.  Not a
mere historian, he has nevertheless carefully consulted the original
sources of information, has weighed testimonies, elicited theories,
and .  .  .  has interpolated the poetry of history with its most
thorough prose."





                           WIDGER'S QUOTATIONS

                  FROM ALEXANDRE DUMAS CELEBRATED CRIMES





THE BORGIAS
borgs10.txt or borgs10.zip [Etext #2741]

Indeed, Caesar (Borgia) had the power of persuasion as a gift from
heaven; and though they perfectly well knew his duplicity, they had no
power of resisting, not so much his actual eloquence as that air of frank
good-nature which Macchiavelli so greatly admired, and which indeed more
than once deceived even him, wily politician as he was.

At a time when he was besieged on all sides by mediocrities....

Forgetfulness is the best cure for the losses we suffer.

The vice-chamberlain (a Cardinal) one day remarked in public, when
certain people were complaining of the venality of justice, "God wills
not that a sinner die, but that he live and pay."

The same day, the cardinal's mother sent the pope the 2000 ducats, and
the next day his mistress, in man's attire, came in person to bring the
missing pearl.  His Holiness, however, was so struck with her beauty in
this costume, that, we are told, he let her keep the pearl for the same
price she had paid for it.

Roderigo, retired from public affairs, was given up entirely to the
affections of a lover and a father, when he heard that his uncle, who
loved him like a son, had been elected pope under the name of Calixtus
III.  But the young man was at this time so much a lover that love
imposed silence on ambition; and indeed he was almost terrified at the
exaltation of his uncle, which was no doubt destined to force him once
more into public life.





THE CENCI
cenci10.txt or cenci10.zip[Etext #2742]

On the 11th of August, 1492, after the lingering death-agony of Innocent
VIII, during which two hundred and twenty murders were committed in the
streets of Rome, Alexander VI ascended the pontifical throne.  Son of a
sister of Pope Calixtus III, Roderigo Lenzuoli Borgia, before being
created cardinal, had five children by Rosa Vanozza, whom he afterwards
caused to be married to a rich Roman.

Having seen that Beatrice was sentenced to the torture ordinary and
extraordinary, and having explained the nature of these tortures, we
proceed to quote the official report:-- "And as in reply to every
question she would confess nothing, we caused her to be taken by two
officers and led from the prison to the torture chamber, where the
torturer was in attendance; there, after cutting off her hair, he made
her sit on a small stool, undressed her, pulled off her shoes, tied her
hands behind her back, fastened them to a rope passed over a pulley
bolted into the ceiling of the aforesaid chamber, and wound up at the
other end by a four lever windlass, worked by two men."





MASSACRES OF THE SOUTH
mssth10.txt or mssth10.zip [Etext #2743]

The massacres went on during the whole of the second day, though towards
evening the search for victims relaxed somewhat; but still many isolated
acts of murder took place during the night.  On the morrow, being tired
of killing, the people began to destroy, and this phase lasted a long
time, it being less fatiguing to throw stones about than corpses.  All
the convents, all the monasteries, all the houses of the priests and
canons were attacked in turn; nothing was spared except the cathedral,
before which axes and crowbars seemed to lose their power, and the church
of Ste. Eugenie, which was turned into a powder-magazine.  The day of the
great butchery was called "La Michelade," because it took place the day
after Michaelmas, and as all this happened in the year 1567 the Massacre
of St.  Bartholomew must be regarded as a plagiarism.

But from this period, each flux and reflux bears more and more the
peculiar character of the party which for the moment is triumphant; when
the Protestants get the upper hand, their vengeance is marked by
brutality and rage; when the Catholics are victorious, the retaliation is
full of hypocrisy and greed.  The Protestants pull down churches and
monasteries, expel the monks, burn the crucifixes, take the body of some
criminal from the gallows, nail it on a cross, pierce its side, put a
crown of thorns round its temples and set it up in the market-place--an
effigy of Jesus on Calvary.  The Catholics levy contributions, take back
what they had been deprived of, exact indemnities, and although ruined by
each reverse, are richer than ever after each victory.





Mary Stuart
marys10.txt or marys10.zip [Etext #2744]

Mary was a harmony in which the most ardent enthusiast for sculptured
form could have found nothing to reproach.  This was indeed Mary's great
and real crime: one single imperfection in face or figure, and she would
not have died upon the scaffold.  Besides, to Elizabeth, who had never
seen her, and who consequently could only judge by hearsay, this beauty
was a great cause of uneasiness and of jealousy, which she could not even
disguise, and which showed itself unceasingly in eager questions.

Unfortunately for her honour, Mary, always more the woman than the queen,
while, on the contrary, Elizabeth was always more the queen than the
woman, had no sooner regained her power than her first royal act was to
exhume Rizzio, who had been quietly buried on the threshold of the chapel
nearest Holyrood Palace, and to have him removed to the burial-place of
the Scottish kings, compromising herself still more by the honours she
paid him dead, than by the favour she had granted him living.






NISIDA
nisid10.txt or nisid10.zip [Etext #2747]

The priests had already begun to sing the death hymn; the executioner was
ready, the procession had set out, when Solomon the fisherman appeared
suddenly on the threshold of the prison, his eyes aflame and his brow
radiant with the halo of the patriarchs.  The old man drew himself up to
his full height, and raising in one hand the reddened knife, said in a
sublime voice, "The sacrifice is fulfilled.  God did not send His angel
to stay the hand of Abraham."

The crowd carried him in triumph!

[The details of this case are recorded in the archives of the Criminal
Court at Naples.  We have changed nothing in the age or position of the
persons who appear in this narrative.  One of the most celebrated
advocates at the Neapolitan bar secured the acquittal of the old man.]






KARL LUDWIG SAND
ksand10.txt or ksand10.zip [Etext #2745]

Fundamentally nothing is great, you see, and nothing small, when things
are looked at apart from one another.





URBAIN GRANDIER
ugran10.txt or ugran10.zip [Etext #2746]

Danger of driving the vanquished to despair.

Let fall from the height of his superiority a few of those disdainful
words which brand as deeply as a red-hot iron.

The more absurd the reports, the more credence did they gain.

....crowd of prejudices, which are sacred to the vulgar.

Fourneau having saluted Grandier, proceeded to carry out his orders,
whereupon a judge said it was not sufficient to shave the body of the
prisoner, but that his nails must also be torn out, lest the devil should
hide beneath them.  Grandier looked at the speaker with an expression of
unutterable pity, and held out his hands to Fourneau; but Forneau put
them gently aside, and said he would do nothing of the kind, even were
the order given by the cardinal-duke himself.





LA CONSTANTIN
const10.txt or const10.zip [Etext #2749]

Madly in love, which is the same as saying that he was hopelessly blind,
silly, and dense to everything around him.

It is singular how very clear-sighted we can be about things that don't
touch us.

There in semi-isolation and despoiled of her greatness lived
Angelique-Louise de Guerchi, formerly companion to Mademoiselle de Pons
and then maid of honour to Anne of Austria.  Her love intrigues and the
scandals they gave rise to had led to her dismissal from court.  Not that
she was a greater sinner than many who remained behind, only she was
unlucky enough or stupid enough to be found out.  Her admirers were so
indiscreet that they had not left her a shred of reputation, and in a
court where a cardinal is the lover of a queen, a hypocritical appearance
of decorum is indispensable to success.  So Angelique had to suffer for
the faults she was not clever enough to hide.





DERUES
derue10.txt or derue10.zip [Etext #2748]

"All passions," says La Bruyere,--"all passions are deceitful; they
disguise themselves as much as possible from the public eye; they hide
from themselves.  There is no vice which has not a counterfeit
resemblance to some virtue, and which does not profit by it."

The whole life of Derues bears testimony to the truth of this
observation.  An avaricious poisoner, he attracted his victims by the
pretence of fervent and devoted piety, and drew them into the snare where
he silently destroyed them.

As soon as his head was covered, the executioner gave the signal.  One
would have thought a very few blows would have finished so frail a being,
but he seemed as hard to kill as the venomous reptiles which must be
crushed and cut to pieces before life is extinct, and the 'coup de grace'
was found necessary.  The executioner uncovered his head and showed the
confessor that the eyes were closed and that the heart had ceased to
beat.  The body was then removed from the cross, the hands and feet
fastened together, and it was thrown on the funeral pile. While the
execution was proceeding the people applauded.  On the morrow they bought
up the fragments of bone, and hastened to buy lottery tickets, in the
firm conviction that these precious relics would bring luck to the
fortunate possessors!





THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK

Voltaire added a few further details which had been given him by M.  de
Bernaville, the successor of M. de Saint-Mars, and by an old physician of
the Bastille who had attended the prisoner whenever his health required a
doctor, but who had never seen his face, although he had "often seen his
tongue and his body."  He also asserted that M. de Chamillart was the
last minister who was in the secret, and that when his son-in-law,
Marshal de la Feuillade, besought him on his knees, de Chamillart being
on his deathbed, to tell him the name of the Man in the Iron Mask, the
minister replied that he was under a solemn oath never to reveal the
secret, it being an affair of state.  To all these details, which the
marshal acknowledges to be correct, Voltaire adds a remarkable note:
"What increases our wonder is, that when the unknown captive was sent to
the Iles Sainte-Marguerite no personage of note disappeared from the
European stage."






JOAN OF NAPLES
jonap10.txt or jonap10.zip [Etext #2750]

The next morning the people were beforehand with the executioner, loudly
demanding their prey.  All the national troops and mercenaries that the
judicial authorities could command were echelonned in the streets,
opposing a sort of dam to the torrent of the raging crowd.  The sudden
insatiable cruelty that too often degrades human nature had awaked in the
populace: all heads were turned with hatred and frenzy; all imaginations
inflamed with the passion for revenge; groups of men and women, roaring
like wild beasts, threatened to knock down the walls of the prison, if
the condemned were not handed over to them to take to the place of
punishment: a great murmur arose, continuous, ever the same, like the
growling of thunder: the queen's heart was petrified with terror.

That same evening the sentence, to the great joy of all, was proclaimed,
that Joan was innocent and acquitted of all concern in the assassination
of her husband.  But as her conduct after the event and the indifference
she had shown about pursuing the authors of the crime admitted of no
valid excuse, the pope declared that there were plain traces of magic,
and that the wrong-doing attributed to Joan was the result of some
baneful charm cast upon her, which she could by no possible means resist.





MARTIN GUERRE
mguer10.txt or mguer10.zip [Etext #2752]

On the 10th of, August 1557, an inauspicious day in the history of
France, the roar of cannon was still heard at six in the evening in the
plains of St. Quentin; where the French army had just been destroyed by
the united troops of England and Spain, commanded by the famous Captain
Emanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy.  An utterly beaten infantry, the
Constable Montmorency and several generals taken prisoner, the Duke
d'Enghien mortally wounded, the flower of the nobility cut down like
grass,--such were the terrible results of a battle which plunged France
into mourning, and which would have been a blot on the reign of Henry II,
had not the Duke of Guise obtained a brilliant revenge the following
year.

This sentence substituted the gallows for the decapitation decreed by the
first judge, inasmuch as the latter punishment was reserved for criminals
of noble birth, while hanging was inflicted on meaner persons.






ALI PACHA
alpac10.txt or alpac10.zip [Etext #2753]

Albania was one of the most difficult provinces to manage.  Its
inhabitants were poor, brave, and, the nature of the country was
mountainous and inaccessible.  The pashas had great difficulty in
collecting tribute, because the people were given to fighting for their
bread.  Whether Mahomedans or Christians, the Albanians were above all
soldiers.  Descended on the one side from the unconquerable Scythians, on
the other from the ancient Macedonians, not long since masters of the
world; crossed with Norman adventurers brought eastwards by the great
movement of the Crusades; they felt the blood of warriors flow in their
veins, and that war was their element.  Sometimes at feud with one
another, canton against canton, village against village, often even house
against house; sometimes rebelling against the government their sanjaks;
sometimes in league with these against the sultan; they never rested from
combat except in an armed peace.  Each tribe had its military
organisation, each family its fortified stronghold, each man his gun on
his shoulder.  When they had nothing better to do, they tilled their
fields, or mowed their neighbours', carrying off, it should be noted, the
crop; or pastured their, flocks, watching the opportunity to trespass
over pasture limits.  This was the normal and regular life of the
population of Epirus, Thesprotia, Thessaly, and Upper Albania.





MURAT
murat10.txt or murat10.zip [Etext #2755]

On the 18th June, 1815, at the very moment when the destiny of Europe was
being decided at Waterloo, a man dressed like a beggar was silently
following the road from Toulon to Marseilles.

Arrived at the entrance of the Gorge of Ollioulles, he halted on a little
eminence from which he could see all the surrounding country; then either
because he had reached the end of his journey, or because, before
attempting that forbidding, sombre pass which is called the Thermopylae
of Provence, he wished to enjoy the magnificent view which spread to the
southern horizon a little longer, he went and sat down on the edge of the
ditch which bordered the road, turning his back on the mountains which
rise like an amphitheatre to the north of the town, and having at his
feet a rich plain covered with tropical vegetation, exotics of a
conservatory, trees and flowers quite unknown in any other part of
France.





THE COUNTESS OF SAINT GERAN

"Could not, for instance," said the marquis, "a confinement be effected
without pain?"

"I don't know about that, but this I do" know, that I shall take very
good care not to practise any method contrary to the laws of nature."

"You are deceiving me: you are acquainted with this method, you have
already practised it upon a certain person whom I could name to you."

"Who has dared to calumniate me thus?  I operate only after the decision
of the Faculty.  God forbid that I should be stoned by all the
physicians, and perhaps expelled from France!"





MARQUISE DE BRINVILLIERS
brinv10.txt or brinv10.zip [Etext #2756]

When the prayer was done and the doctor raised his head, he saw before
him the executioner wiping his face.  "Well, sir," said he, "was not that
a good stroke?  I always put up a prayer on these occasions, and God has
always assisted me; but I have been anxious for several days about this
lady.  I had six masses said, and I felt strengthened in hand and heart."
He then pulled out a bottle from under his cloak, and drank a dram; and
taking the body under one arm, all dressed as it was, and the head in his
other hand, the eyes still bandaged, he threw both upon the faggots,
which his assistant lighted.

"The next day," says Madame de Sevigne, "people were looking for the
charred bones of Madame de Brinvilliers, because they said she was a
saint."





MARQUISE DE GANGES
gange10.txt or gange10.zip [Etext #2758]

The beginnings of this union were perfectly happy; the marquis was in
love for the first time, and the marquise did not remember ever to have
been in love.  A son and a daughter came to complete their happiness.
The marquise had entirely forgotten the fatal prediction, or, if she
occasionally thought of it now, it was to wonder that she could ever have
believed in it.  Such happiness is not of this world, and when by chance
it lingers here a while, it seems sent rather by the anger than by the
goodness of God.  Better, indeed, would it be for him who possesses and
who loses it, never to have known it.






VANINKA
vanin10.txt or vanin10.zip [Etext #2757]

About the end of the reign of the Emperor Paul I--that is to say, towards
the middle of the first year of the nineteenth century--just as four
o'clock in the afternoon was sounding from the church of St.  Peter and
St. Paul, whose gilded vane overlooks the ramparts of the fortress, a
crowd, composed of all sorts and conditions of people, began to gather in
front of a house which belonged to General Count Tchermayloff, formerly
military governor of a fair-sized town in the government of Pultava.  The
first spectators had been attracted by the preparations which they saw
had been made in the middle of the courtyard for administering torture
with the knout.  One of the general's serfs, he who acted as barber, was
to be the victim.

Although this kind of punishment was a common enough sight in St.
Petersburg, it nevertheless attracted all passers-by when it was publicly
administered.  This was the occurrence which had caused a crowd, as just
mentioned, before General Tchermayloff's house.





THE COMPLETE CELEBRATED CRIMES BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS, PERE
dcrim10.txt or dcrim10.zip [Etext #2760]

Air of frank good-nature which Macchiavelli so greatly admired
All passions are deceitful
Always in extremes, whether of enthusiasm or hatred
Besieged on all sides by mediocrities
Danger of driving the vanquished to despair
Determination to exact his strict legal rights
Disdainful words which brand as deeply as a red-hot iron
Doubting spirit which was unhappily so prevalent
Forgetfulness is the best cure for the losses we suffer
Fundamentally nothing is great, you see, and nothing small
God wills not that a sinner die, but that he live and pay
Influence he had gained over the narrow-minded
Interpolated according to the needs of the prosecution
Italy and Greece seemed to be mere suburbs of Venice
Jesus, Son of David and Mary
Knew how short was the space between a prison and a tomb
Let her keep the pearl for the same price she had paid for it
Madly in love-that is to say silly and blind
Method contrary to the laws of nature
More absurd the reports, the more credence did they gain
No vice which has not a counterfeit resemblance to some virtue
Prejudices, which are sacred to the vulgar
Put to the question ordinary and extraordinary
So much a lover that love imposed silence on ambition
The last thing I should desire would be to be as dead as he
To draw back was to acknowledge one's guilt
Too commonplace ever to arrive at a high position
Vanity and self-satisfaction
Very clear-sighted we can be about things that don't touch us
Without fear of being called to account
