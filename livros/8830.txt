Book 42 Luke

001:001 Seeing that many have attempted to draw up a narrative
        of the facts which are received with full assurance among us

001:002 on the authority of those who were from the beginning eye-witnesses
        and were devoted to the service of the divine Message,

001:003 it has seemed right to me also, after careful investigation
        of the facts from their commencement, to write for you,
        most noble Theophilus, a connected account,

001:004 that you may fully know the truth of the things which you
        have been taught by word of mouth.

001:005 There was in the time of Herod, the king of Judaea, a priest
        of the name of Zechariah, belonging to the class of Abijah.
        He had a wife who was a descendant of Aaron, and her
        name was Elizabeth.

001:006 They were both of them upright before God, blamelessly obeying
        all the Lord's precepts and ordinances.

001:007 But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren;
        and both of them were far advanced in life.

001:008 Now while he was doing priestly duty before God in the prescribed
        course of his class,

001:009 it fell to his lot--according to the custom of the priesthood--
        to go into the Sanctuary of the Lord and burn the incense;

001:010 and the whole multitude of the people were outside praying,
        at the hour of incense.

001:011 Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing
        on the right side of the altar of incense;

001:012 and Zechariah on seeing him was agitated and terrified.

001:013 But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your
        petition has been heard:  and your wife Elizabeth will bear
        you a son, and you are to call his name John.

001:014 Gladness and exultant joy shall be yours, and many will rejoice
        over his birth.

001:015 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; no wine or
        fermented drink shall he ever drink; but he will be filled
        with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth.

001:016 Many of the descendants of Israel will he turn to the Lord their God;

001:017 and he will be His forerunner in the spirit and power
        of Elijah, to turn fathers' hearts to the children,
        and cause the rebellious to walk in the wisdom of the upright,
        to make a people perfectly ready for the lord."

001:018 "By what proof," asked Zechariah, "shall I know this?
        For I am an old man, and my wife is far advanced in years."

001:019 "I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God,"
        answered the angel, "and I have been sent to talk with you
        and tell you this good news.

001:020 And now you will be dumb and unable to speak until the day
        when this has taken place; because you did not believe my words--
        words which will be fulfilled at their appointed time."

001:021 Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah, and were
        surprised that he stayed so long in the Sanctuary.

001:022 When, however, he came out, he was unable to speak to them;
        and they knew that he must have seen a vision in the Sanctuary;
        but he kept making signs to them and continued dumb.

001:023 When his days of service were at an end, he went to his home;

001:024 and in course of time his wife Elizabeth conceived, and kept
        herself secluded five months.

001:025 "Thus has the Lord dealt with me," she said, "now that He has
        graciously taken away my reproach among men."

001:026 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God
        to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,

001:027 to a maiden betrothed to a man of the name of Joseph,
        a descendant of David.  The maiden's name was Mary.

001:028 So Gabriel went into the house and said to her, "Joy be to you,
        favoured one! the Lord is with you."

001:029 She was greatly agitated at his words, and wondered what such
        a greeting meant.

001:030 But the angel said, "Do not be frightened, Mary, for you
        have found favour with God.

001:031 You will conceive in your womb and bear a son; and you are
        to call His name JESUS.

001:032 He will be great and He will be called `Son of the Most High.'
        And the Lord God will give Him the throne of His forefather David;

001:033 and He will be King over the House of Jacob for the Ages,
        and of His Kingdom there will be no end."

001:034 "How can this be," Mary replied, "seeing that I have no husband?"

001:035 The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
        and the power of the Most High will overshadow you;
        and for this reason your holy offspring will be called `the
        Son of God.'

001:036 And see, your relative Elizabeth--she also has conceived
        a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her
        who was called barren.

001:037 For no promise from God will be impossible of fulfilment."

001:038 "I am the Lord's maidservant," Mary replied; "may it be with me
        in accordance with your words!"  And then the angel left her.

001:039 Not long after this, Mary rose up and went in haste into the hill
        country to a town in Judah.

001:040 Here she came to the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth;

001:041 and as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe leapt
        within her.  And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,

001:042 and uttered a loud cry of joy.  "Blest among women are you,"
        she said, "and the offspring of your body is blest!

001:043 But why is this honour done me, that the mother of my Lord
        should come to me?

001:044 For, the moment your greeting reached my ears, the babe within
        me leapt for joy.

001:045 And blessed is she who has believed, for the word spoken
        to her from the Lord shall be fulfilled."

001:046 Then Mary said:  "My soul extols the Lord,

001:047 And my spirit triumphs in God my Saviour;

001:048 Because He has not turned from His maidservant in her lowly position;
        For from this time forward all generations will account me happy,

001:049 Because the mighty One has done great things for me--
        Holy is His name!--

001:050 And His compassion is, generation after generation, Upon those
        who fear Him.

001:051 He has manifested His supreme strength.  He has scattered
        those who were haughty in the thoughts of their hearts.

001:052 He has cast monarchs down from their thrones, And exalted men
        of low estate.

001:053 The hungry He has satisfied with choice gifts, But the rich
        He has sent empty-handed away.

001:054 His servant Israel He has helped, Remembering His compassion--

001:055 In fulfillment of His promises to our forefathers--For Abraham
        and his posterity for ever."

001:056 So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months,
        and then returned home.

001:057 Now when Elizabeth's full time was come, she gave birth to a son;

001:058 and her neighbours and relatives heard how the Lord had had
        great compassion on her; and they rejoiced with her.

001:059 And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child,
        and were going to call him Zechariah, after his father.

001:060 His mother, however, said, "No, he is to be called John."

001:061 "There is not one of your family," they said, "who has that name."

001:062 They asked his father by signs what he wished him to be called.

001:063 So he asked for a writing-tablet, and wrote, "His name is John."
        And they all wondered.

001:064 Instantly his mouth and his tongue were set free, and he began
        to speak and bless God.

001:065 And all who lived round about them were filled with awe,
        and throughout the hill country of Judaea reports of all
        these things were spread abroad.

001:066 All who heard the story treasured it in their memories.
        "What then will this child be?" they said.  For the lord's
        hand was indeed with him.

001:067 And Zechariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit,
        and spoke in a rapture of praise.

001:068 "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel," he said, "Because He has
        not forgotten His people but has effected redemption for them,

001:069 And has raised up a mighty Deliverer for us In the house
        of David His servant--

001:070 As He has spoken from all time by the lips of His holy Prophets--

001:071 To deliver us from our foes and from the power of all who hate us.

001:072 He dealt pitifully with our forefathers, And remembered
        His holy covenant,

001:073 The oath which He swore to Abraham our forefather,

001:074 To grant us to be rescued from the power of our foes And
        so render worship to Him free from fear,

001:075 In piety and uprightness before Him all our days.

001:076 And you moreover, O child, shall be called Prophet of
        the Most High; For you shall go on in front before the Lord
        to prepare the way for Him,

001:077 To give to His People a knowledge of salvation In the forgiveness
        of their sins,

001:078 Through the tender compassion of our God, Through which
        the daybreak from on high will come to us,

001:079 Dawning on those who now dwell in the darkness and shadow of death--
        To direct our feet into the path of peace."

001:080 And the child grew and became strong in character,
        and lived in the Desert till the time came for him to appear
        publicly to Israel.

002:001 Just at this time an edict was issued by Caesar Augustus
        for the registration of the whole Empire.

002:002 It was the first registration made during the governorship
        of Quirinius in Syria;

002:003 and all went to be registered--every one to the town to
        which he belonged.

002:004 So Joseph went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth,
        to Judaea, to David's town of Bethlehem, because he was
        of the house and lineage of David,

002:005 to have himself registered together with Mary, who was betrothed
        to him and was with child.

002:006 But while they were there, her full time came,

002:007 and she gave birth to her first-born son, and wrapped Him round,
        and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them
        in the inn.

002:008 Now there were shepherds in the same part of the country,
        keeping watch over their sheep by night in the open fields,

002:009 when suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory
        of the Lord shone round them; and they were filled with terror.

002:010 But the angel said to them, "Put away all fear; for I am
        bringing you good news of great joy--joy for all the People.

002:011 For a Saviour who is the Anointed Lord is born to you to-day,
        in the town of David.

002:012 And this is the token for you:  you will find a babe wrapped
        in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger."

002:013 And immediately there was with the angel a multitude of the army
        of Heaven praising God and saying,

002:014 "Glory be to God in the highest Heavens, And on earth peace
        among men who please Him!"

002:015 Then, as soon as the angels had left them and returned to Heaven,
        the shepherds said to one another, "Let us now go over as far
        as Bethlehem and see this that has happened, which the Lord
        has made known to us."

002:016 So they made haste and came and found Mary and Joseph,
        with the babe lying in the manger.

002:017 And when they saw the child, they told what had been said
        to them about Him;

002:018 and all who listened were astonished at what the shepherds told them.

002:019 But Mary treasured up all these things, often dwelling on them
        in her mind.

002:020 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all
        that they had heard and seen in accordance with the announcement
        made to them.

002:021 When eight days had passed and the time for circumcising Him
        had come, He was called JESUS, the name given Him by the angel
        before His conception in the womb.

002:022 And when the days for their purification appointed by the Law
        of Moses had passed, they took Him up to Jerusalem to present
        Him to the Lord--

002:023 as it is written in the Law of the Lord:  "Every first-born
        male shall be called holy to the Lord."

002:024 And they also offered a sacrifice as commanded in the Law
        of the Lord, "a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons."

002:025 Now there was a man in Jerusalem of the name of Symeon,
        an upright and God-fearing man, who was waiting for the consolation
        of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

002:026 To him it had been revealed by the Holy Spirit that he should
        not see death until he had seen the Lord's Anointed One.

002:027 Led by the Spirit he came to the Temple; and when the parents
        brought in the child Jesus to do with regard to Him according
        to the custom of the Law,

002:028 he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said,

002:029 "Now, O Sovereign Lord, Thou dost send Thy servant away in peace,
        in fulfilment of Thy word,

002:030 Because mine eyes have seen Thy salvation,

002:031 Which Thou hast made ready in the sight of all nations--

002:032 A light to shine upon the Gentiles, And the glory of
        Thy people Israel."

002:033 And while the child's father and mother were wondering at
        the words of Symeon concerning Him,

002:034 Symeon blessed them and said to Mary the mother, "This child
        is appointed for the falling and the uprising of many in Israel
        and for a token to be spoken against;

002:035 and a sword will pierce through your own soul also;
        that the reasonings in many hearts may be revealed."

002:036 There was also Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel,
        belonging to the tribe of Asher.  She was of a very great age,
        having had after her maidenhood seven years of married life,

002:037 and then being a widow of eighty-four years.  She was never
        absent from the Temple, but worshipped, by day and by night,
        with fasting and prayer.

002:038 And coming up just at that moment, she gave thanks to God,
        and spoke about the child to all who were expecting
        the deliverance of Jerusalem.

002:039 Then, as soon as they had accomplished all that the Law required,
        they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.

002:040 And the child grew and became strong and full of wisdom,
        and the favour of God rested upon Him.

002:041 Now His parents used to go up year by year to Jerusalem at
        the Feast of the Passover.

002:042 And when He was twelve years old they went up as was customary
        at the time of the Feast, and,

002:043 after staying the full number of days, when they started
        back home the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem.
        His parents did not discover this,

002:044 but supposing Him to be in the travelling company, they proceeded
        a day's journey.  Then they searched up and down for Him
        among their relatives and acquaintances;

002:045 but being unable to find Him they returned to Jerusalem,
        making anxious inquiry for Him.

002:046 On the third day they found Him in the Temple sitting among
        the Rabbis, both listening to them and asking them questions,

002:047 while all who heard Him were astonished at His intelligence
        and at the answers He gave.

002:048 When they saw Him, they were smitten with amazement, and His
        mother said to Him, "My child, why have you behaved thus to us?
        Your father and I have been searching for you in anguish."

002:049 "Why is it that you have been searching for me?"  He replied;
        "did you not know that it is my duty to be engaged upon
        my Father's business?"

002:050 But they did not understand the significance of these words.

002:051 Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was
        always obedient to them; but His mother carefully treasured
        up all these incidents in her memory.

002:052 And as Jesus grew older He gained in both wisdom and stature,
        and in favour with God and man.

003:001 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
        Pontius Pilate being Governor of Judaea, Herod Tetrarch of Galilee,
        his brother Philip Tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis,
        and Lysanias Tetrarch of Abilene,

003:002 during the High-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, a message
        from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the Desert.

003:003 John went into all the district about the Jordan proclaiming
        a baptism of the penitent for the forgiveness of sins;

003:004 as it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah, "The voice of
        one crying aloud!  `In the Desert prepare ye a road for the Lord:
        make His highway straight.

003:005 Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill
        levelled down, the crooked places shall be turned into
        straight roads, and the rugged ways into smooth;

003:006 and then shall all mankind see God's salvation.'"

003:007 Accordingly John used to say to the crowds who came out to be
        baptized by him, "O vipers' brood, who has warned you to flee
        from the coming wrath?

003:008 Live lives which shall prove your change of heart; and do not
        begin to say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our forefather,'
        for I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham
        from these stones.

003:009 And even now the axe is lying at the root of the trees,
        so that every tree which fails to yield good fruit will quickly
        be hewn down and thrown into the fire."

003:010 The crowds repeatedly asked him, "What then are we to do?"

003:011 "Let the man who has two coats," he answered, "give one
        to the man who has none; and let the man who has food share
        it with others."

003:012 There came also a party of tax-gatherers to be baptized,
        and they asked him, "Rabbi, what are we to do?"

003:013 "Do not exact more than the legal amount," he replied.

003:014 The soldiers also once and again inquired of him, "And we,
        what are we to do?"  His answer was, "Neither intimidate any
        one nor lay false charges; and be content with your pay."

003:015 And while the people were in suspense and all were debating
        in their minds whether John might possibly be the Anointed One,

003:016 he answered the question by saying to them all, "As for me,
        I am baptizing you with water, but One mightier than I is coming,
        whose very sandal-strap I am not worthy to unfasten:
        He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and with fire.

003:017 His winnowing-shovel is in His hand to clear out His threshing-floor,
        and to gather the wheat into His storehouse; but the chaff
        He will burn up in fire unquenchable."

003:018 With many exhortations besides these he declared the Good News
        to the people.

003:019 But Herod the Tetrarch, being repeatedly rebuked by him about
        Herodias his brother's wife, and about all the wicked deeds
        that he had done,

003:020 now added this to crown all the rest, that he threw
        John into prison.

003:021 Now when all the people had been baptized, and Jesus also had
        been baptized and was praying, the sky opened,

003:022 and the Holy Spirit came down in bodily shape, like a dove,
        upon Him, and a voice came from Heaven, which said, "Thou art
        My Son, dearly loved:  in Thee is My delight."

003:023 And He--Jesus--when He began His ministry, was about thirty
        years old.  He was the son (it was supposed) of Joseph,
        son of Heli,

003:024 son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Melchi, son of Jannai,
        son of Joseph,

003:025 son of Mattathias, son of Amos, son of Nahum, son of Esli,
        son of Naggai,

003:026 son of Mahath, son of Mattathias, son of Semein, son of Josech,
        son of Joda,

003:027 son of Johanan, son of Resa, son of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel,
        son of Neri,

003:028 son of Melchi, son of Addi, son of Cosam, son of Elmadam,
        son of Er,

003:029 son of Joshua, son of Eliezar, son of Jorim, son of Maththat,
        son of Levi,

003:030 son of Symeon, son of Judah, son of Joseph, son of Jonam,
        son of Eliakim, son of

003:031 Melea, son of Menna, son of Mattatha, son of Nathan,
        son of David,

003:032 son of Jesse, son of Obed, son of Boaz, son of Salmon,
        son of Nahshon,

003:033 son of Amminadab, son of Admin, son of Arni, son of Hezron,
        son of Perez, son of Judah,

003:034 son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, son of Terah,
        son of Nahor,

003:035 son of Serug, son of Reu, son of Peleg, son of Eber,
        son of Shelah,

003:036 son of Cainan, son of Arpachshad, son of Shem, son of Noah,
        son of Lamech,

003:037 son of Methuselah, son of Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalalel,
        son of Kenan,

003:038 son of Enosh, son of Seth, son of Adam, son of God.

004:001 Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan,
        and was led about by the Spirit in the Desert for forty days,

004:002 tempted all the while by the Devil.  During those days He
        ate nothing, and at the close of them He suffered from hunger.

004:003 Then the Devil said to Him, "If you are God's Son, tell this
        stone to become bread."

004:004 "It is written," replied Jesus, "`It is not on bread alone
        that a man shall live.'"

004:005 The Devil next led Him up and caused Him to see at a glance
        all the kingdoms of the world.

004:006 And the Devil said to Him, "To you will I give all this authority
        and this splendour; for it has been handed over to me,
        and on whomsoever I will I bestow it.

004:007 If therefore you do homage to me, it shall all be yours.'

004:008 Jesus answered him, "It is written, `To the Lord thy God thou
        shalt do homage, and to Him alone shalt thou render worship.'"

004:009 Then he brought Him to Jerusalem and caused Him to stand on
        the roof of the Temple, and said to Him, "If you are God's Son,
        throw yourself down from here; for it is written,

004:010 `He will give orders to His angels concerning thee,
        to guard thee safely;'

004:011 and `On their hands they shall bear thee up, Lest at any moment
        thou shouldst strike thy foot against a stone.'"

004:012 The reply of Jesus was, "It is said, `Thou shalt not put
        the Lord they God to the proof.'"

004:013 So the Devil, having fully tried every kind of temptation on Him,
        left Him for a time.

004:014 Then Jesus returned in the Spirit's power to Galilee;
        and His fame spread through all the adjacent districts.

004:015 And He proceeded to teach in their synagogues, winning
        praise from all.

004:016 He came to Nazareth also, where He had been brought up;
        and, as was His custom, He went to the synagogue on the Sabbath,
        and stood up to read.

004:017 And there was handed to Him the book of the Prophet Isaiah, and,
        opening the book, He found the place where it was written,

004:018 "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me
        to proclaim Good News to the poor; He has sent me to announce
        release to the prisoners of war and recovery of sight to the blind:
        to send away free those whom tyranny has crushed,

004:019 to proclaim the year of acceptance with the Lord."

004:020 And rolling up the book, He returned it to the attendant,
        and sat down--to speak.  And the eyes of all in the synagogue
        were fixed on Him.

004:021 Then He proceeded to say to them, "To-day is this Scripture
        fulfilled in your hearing."

004:022 And they all spoke well of Him, wondering at the sweet words of
        kindness which fell from His lips, while they asked one another,
        "Is not this Joseph's son?"

004:023 "Doubtless," said He, "you will quote to me the proverb,
        `Physician, cure yourself:  all that we hear that you have
        done at Capernaum, do here also in your native place.'"

004:024 "I tell you in solemn truth," He added, "that no Prophet
        is welcomed among his own people.

004:025 But I tell you in truth that there was many a widow in Israel
        in the time of Elijah, when there was no rain for three years
        and six months and there came a severe famine over all the land;

004:026 and yet to not one of them was Elijah sent:  he was only sent
        to a widow at Zarephath in the Sidonian country.

004:027 And there was also many a leper in Israel in the time of
        the Prophet Elisha, and yet not one of them was cleansed,
        but Naaman the Syrian was."

004:028 Then all in the synagogue, while listening to these words,
        were filled with fury.

004:029 They rose, hurried Him outside the town, and brought Him
        to the brow of the hill on which their town was built,
        to throw Him down the cliff;

004:030 but He passed through the midst of them and went His way.

004:031 So He came down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, where He
        frequently taught the people on the Sabbath days.

004:032 And they were greatly impressed by His teaching, because He
        spoke with the language of authority.

004:033 But in the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit
        of a foul demon.  In a loud voice he cried out,

004:034 "Ha!  Jesus the Nazarene, what have you to do with us?
        I know who you are--God's Holy One!"

004:035 But Jesus rebuked the demon.  "Silence!"  He exclaimed;
        "come out of him."  Upon this, the demon hurled the man
        into the midst of them, and came out of him without doing
        him any harm.

004:036 All were astonished and awe-struck; and they asked one another,
        "What sort of language is this?  For with authority and real
        power He gives orders to the foul spirits and they come out."

004:037 And the talk about Him spread into every part of
        the neighbouring country.

004:038 Now when He rose and left the synagogue He went to Simon's house.
        Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from an acute attack of fever;
        and they consulted Him about her.

004:039 Then standing over her He rebuked the fever, and it left her;
        and she at once rose and waited on them.

004:040 At sunset all who had friends suffering from any illness brought
        them to Him, and He laid His hands on them all, one by one,
        and cured them.

004:041 Demons also came out of many, loudly calling out, "You are
        the Son of God."  But He rebuked them and forbad them to speak,
        because they knew Him to be the Christ.

004:042 Next morning, at daybreak, He left the town and went away
        to a solitary place; but the people flocked out to find Him,
        and, coming to the place where He was, they endeavoured
        to detain Him that He might not leave them.

004:043 But He said to them, "I have to tell the Good News of the Kingdom
        of God to the other towns also, because for this purpose
        I was sent."

004:044 And for some time He preached in the synagogues in Galilee.

005:001 On one occasion the crowd was pressing on Him and listening to
        God's Message, while He was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret.

005:002 He, however, saw two fishing-boats drawn up on the beach
        (for the men had gone away from them and were washing the nets),

005:003 and going on board one of them, which was Simon's He asked him
        to push out a little from land.  Then He sat down and taught
        the crowd of people from the boat.

005:004 When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, "Push out
        into deep water, and let down your nets for a haul."

005:005 "Rabbi," replied Peter, "all night long we have worked
        hard and caught nothing; but at your command I will let
        down the nets."

005:006 This they did, and enclosed a vast number of fish; and their
        nets began to break.

005:007 So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come
        and help them; they came, and they filled both the boats
        so that they almost sank.

005:008 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at the knees of Jesus,
        and exclaimed, "Master, leave my boat, for I am a sinful man."

005:009 (For he was astonished and terrified--he and all his companions--
        at the haul of fish which they had taken;

005:010 and so were Simon's partners James and John, the sons of Zabdi.)
        But Jesus replied to Simon, "Fear not:  from this time you
        shall be a catcher of men."

005:011 Then, after bringing their boats to land, they left everything
        and followed Him.

005:012 On another occasion, when He was in one of the towns,
        there was a man there covered with leprosy, who, seeing Jesus,
        threw himself at His feet and implored Him, saying, "Sir,
        if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean."

005:013 Reaching out His hand and touching him, Jesus said, "I am willing;
        be cleansed!"  And instantly the leprosy left him.

005:014 He ordered him to tell no one.  "But go," He said, "show yourself
        to the Priest, and make the offering for your purification
        which Moses appointed, as evidence for them."

005:015 But all the more the report about Him spread abroad,
        and great multitudes crowded to hear Him and to be cured
        of their diseases;

005:016 but Jesus Himself constantly withdrew into the Desert
        and there prayed.

005:017 One day He was teaching, and there were Pharisees
        and teachers of the Law sitting there who had come from
        every village in Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem.
        And the power of the Lord was present for Him to cure people.

005:018 And a party of men came carrying a palsied man on a bed,
        and they endeavoured to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.

005:019 But when they could find no way of doing so because of the crowd,
        they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiling--
        bed and all--into the midst, in front of Jesus.

005:020 He saw their faith and said to him, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."

005:021 Then the Scribes and Pharisees began to cavil, asking, "Who is this,
        uttering blasphemies?  Who but God alone can forgive sins?"

005:022 Well aware of their reasonings, Jesus answered their questions
        by asking in turn, "What is this that you are debating
        in your hearts?

005:023 Which is easier?--to say, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say,
        `Rise and walk'?

005:024 But to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on
        earth to forgive sins"--Turning to the paralytic He said,
        "I bid you, Rise, take up your bed, and go home."

005:025 Instantly he stood up in their presence, took up the mattress
        on which he had been lying, and went away to his home,
        giving glory to God.

005:026 Amazement seized them all.  "Glory to God!" was the abiding feeling.
        Yet fear flashed through their minds and they said, "We have
        seen strange things to-day."

005:027 After this He went out and noticed a tax-gatherer, Levi by name,
        sitting at the Toll office; and He said to him, "Follow me."

005:028 He rose, left everything, and followed Him.

005:029 Levi also gave a great entertainment at his house in honour
        of Jesus, and there was a large party of tax-gatherers
        and others at table with them.

005:030 This led the Pharisees and Scribes of their party to expostulate
        with His disciples and ask, "Why are you eating and drinking
        with these tax-gatherers and notorious sinners?"

005:031 But Jesus replied to them, "It is not men in good health
        who require a physician, but the sick.

005:032 I have not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners."

005:033 Again they said to Him, "John's disciples fast often and pray,
        as do also those of the pharisees; but yours eat and drink."

005:034 "Can you compel the bridal party to fast," replied Jesus,
        "so long as they have the bridegroom among them?

005:035 But a time for this will come, when the Bridegroom has been
        taken away from them:  then, at that time, they will fast."

005:036 He also spoke in figurative language to them.  "No one,"
        He said, "tears a piece from a new garment to mend an old one.
        Otherwise he would not only spoil the new, but the patch
        from the new would not match the old.

005:037 Nor does any one pour new wine into old wine-skins. Otherwise
        the new wine would burst the skins, the wine itself would
        be spilt, and the skins be destroyed.

005:038 But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.

005:039 Nor does any one after drinking old wine wish for new;
        for he says, `The old is better.'"

006:001 Now on the second-first Sabbath while He was passing through
        the wheatfields, His disciples were plucking the ears and
        rubbing them with their hands to eat the grain.

006:002 And some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what the Law
        forbids on the Sabbath?"

006:003 "Have you never read so much as this," answered Jesus--"what David
        did when he and his followers were hungry;

006:004 how he entered the house of God and took and ate the Presented Loaves
        and gave some to his followers--loaves which none but the Priests
        are allowed to eat?"

006:005 "The Son of Man," He added, "is Lord of the Sabbath also."

006:006 On another Sabbath He had gone to the synagogue and was
        teaching there; and in the congregation was a man whose
        right arm was withered.

006:007 The Scribes and the Pharisees were on the watch to see whether
        He would cure him on the Sabbath that they might be able
        to bring an accusation against Him.

006:008 He knew their thoughts, and said to the man with the
        withered arm, "Rise, and stand there in the middle."
        And he rose and stood there.

006:009 Then Jesus said to them, "I put it to you all whether we
        are allowed to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil;
        to save a life, or to destroy it."

006:010 And looking round upon them all He said to the man, "Stretch out
        your arm."  He did so, and the arm was restored.

006:011 But they were filled with madness, and began to discuss
        with one another what they should do to Jesus.

006:012 About that time He went out on one occasion into the hill
        country to pray; and He remained all night in prayer to God.

006:013 When it was day, He called His disciples; and He selected
        from among them twelve, whom He also named Apostles.

006:014 These were Simon, to whom also He had given the name of Peter,
        and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;

006:015 Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus and Simon
        called the Zealot;

006:016 James's relative Judas, and Judas Iscariot who proved to
        be a traitor.

006:017 With these He came down till He reached a level place,
        where there was a great crowd of His disciples, and a multitude
        of people from every part of Judaea, from Jerusalem,
        and from the sea-side district of Tyre and Sidon, who came
        to hear Him and to be cured of their diseases;

006:018 and those who were tormented by foul spirits were cured.

006:019 The whole crowd were eager to touch Him, because power went
        forth from him and cured every one.

006:020 Then fixing His eyes upon His disciples, Jesus said to them,
        "Blessed are you poor, because the Kingdom of God is yours.

006:021 "Blessed are you who hunger now, because your hunger shall
        be satisfied.  "Blessed are you who now weep aloud,
        because you shall laugh.

006:022 "Blessed are you when men shall hate you and exclude you
        from their society and insult you, and spurn your very names
        as evil things, for the Son of Man's sake.

006:023 "Be glad at such a time, and dance for joy; for your reward
        is great in Heaven; for that is just the way their forefathers
        behaved to the Prophets!

006:024 "But alas for you rich men, because you already
        have your consolation!

006:025 "Alas for you who now have plenty to eat, because you will be hungry!
        "Alas for you who laugh now, because you will mourn
        and weep aloud!

006:026 "Alas for you when men shall all have spoken well of you;
        for that is just the way their forefathers behaved to
        the false Prophets!

006:027 "But to you who are listening to me I say, Love your enemies;
        seek the welfare of those who hate you;

006:028 bless those who curse you; pray for those who revile you.

006:029 To him who gives you a blow on one side of the face offer
        the other side also; and to him who is robbing you of your
        outer garment refuse not the under one also.

006:030 To every one who asks, give; and from him who takes away
        your property, do not demand it back.

006:031 And behave to your fellow men just as you would have them
        behave to you.

006:032 "If you love those who love you, what credit is it to you?
        Why, even bad men love those who love them.

006:033 And if you are kind to those who are kind to you, what credit
        is it to you?  Even bad men act thus.

006:034 And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive,
        what credit is it to you?  Even bad men lend to their fellows
        so as to receive back an equal amount.

006:035 Nevertheless love your enemies, be beneficent; and lend
        without hoping for any repayment.  Then your recompense
        shall be great, and you will be sons of the Most High;
        for He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.

006:036 Be compassionate just as your Father is compassionate.

006:037 "Judge not, and you shall not be judged; condemn not, and you
        shall not be condemned; pardon, and you shall be pardoned;

006:038 give, and gifts shall be bestowed on you.  Full measure, pressed,
        shaken down, and running over, shall they pour into your laps;
        for with the same measure that you use they shall measure
        to you in return."

006:039 He also spoke to them in figurative language.  "Can a blind
        man lead a blind man?"  He asked; "would not both fall
        into the ditch?

006:040 There is no disciple who is superior to his teacher; but every
        one whose instruction is complete will be like his teacher.

006:041 "And why look at the splinter in your brother's eye instead
        of giving careful attention to the beam in your own?

006:042 How can you say to your brother, `Brother, let me take that
        splinter out of your eye,' when all the while you yourself
        do not see the beam in your own eye?  Vain pretender! take
        the beam out of your own eye first, and then you will see
        clearly to take the splinter out of your brother's eye.

006:043 "There is no good tree that yields unsound fruit, nor again
        any unsound tree that yields good fruit.

006:044 Every tree is known by its own fruit.  It is not from thorns
        that men gather figs, nor from the bramble that they can get
        a bunch of grapes.

006:045 A good man from the good stored up in his heart brings
        out what is good; and an evil man from the evil stored up
        brings out what is evil; for from the overflow of his heart
        his mouth speaks.

006:046 "And why do you all call me `Master, Master' and yet not do
        what I tell you?

006:047 Every one who comes to me and listens to my words and puts
        them in practice, I will show you whom he is like.

006:048 He is like a man building a house, who digs and goes deep,
        and lays the foundation on the rock; and when a flood comes,
        the torrent bursts upon that house, but is unable to shake it,
        because it is securely built.

006:049 But he who has heard and not practised is like a man who has
        built a house upon the soft soil without a foundation,
        against which the torrent bursts, and immediately it collapses,
        and terrible is the wreck and ruin of that house."

007:001 After He had finished teaching all these things in the hearing
        of the people, He went into Capernaum.

007:002 Here the servant of a certain Captain, a man dear to his master,
        was ill and at the point of death;

007:003 and the Captain, hearing about Jesus, sent to Him some
        of the Jewish Elders, begging Him to come and restore his
        servant to health.

007:004 And they, when they came to Jesus, earnestly entreated Him,
        pleading, "He deserves to have this favour granted him,

007:005 for he loves our nation, and at his own expense he built our
        synagogue for us."

007:006 Then Jesus went with them.  But when He was not far from
        the house, the Captain sent friends to Him with the message:
        "Sir, do not trouble to come.  I am not worthy of having you
        come under my roof;

007:007 and therefore I did not deem myself worthy to come to you.
        Only speak the word, and let my young man be cured.

007:008 For I too am a man obedient to authority, and have soldiers
        under me; and I say to one, `Go,' and he goes; to another,
        `Come,' and he comes; and to my slave, `Do this or that,'
        and he does it."

007:009 Jesus listened to the Captain's message and was astonished at him,
        and He turned and said to the crowd that followed Him, "I tell
        you that not even in Israel have I found faith like that."

007:010 And the friends who had been sent, on returning to the house,
        found the servant in perfect health.

007:011 Shortly afterwards He went to a town called Nain, attended by His
        disciples and a great crowd of people.

007:012 And just as He reached the gate of the town, they happened to be
        bringing out for burial a dead man who was his mother's only son;
        and she was a widow; and a great number of the townspeople
        were with her.

007:013 The Lord saw her, was moved with pity for her, and said to her,
        "Do not weep."

007:014 Then He went close and touched the bier, and the bearers halted.
        "Young man," He said, "I command you, wake!"

007:015 The dead man sat up and began to speak; and He restored him
        to his mother.

007:016 All were awe-struck, and they gave glory to God--some saying,
        "A Prophet, a great Prophet, has risen up among us."
        Others said, "God has not forgotten His People."

007:017 And the report of what Jesus had done spread through the whole
        of Judaea and in all the surrounding districts.

007:018 John's disciples brought him an account of all these things;

007:019 so John called two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord.
        "Are you the Coming One?" he asked, "or is there another
        that we are to expect?"

007:020 The men came to Jesus and said, "John the Baptist has sent
        us to you with this question:  `Are you the Coming One,
        or is there another that we are to expect?'"

007:021 He immediately cured many of diseases, severe pain, and evil spirits,
        and to many who were blind He gave the gift of sight.

007:022 Then He answered the messengers, "Go and report to John what you
        have seen and heard.  Blind men receive sight, the lame walk,
        lepers are purified, deaf persons hear, the dead are raised
        to life, the poor have the Good News proclaimed to them.

007:023 And blessed is every one who does not stumble and fall because
        of my claims."

007:024 When John's messengers were gone, He proceeded to say to the multitude
        concerning John, "What did you go out into the Desert to gaze at?
        A reed waving in the wind?

007:025 But what did you go out to see?  A man wearing luxurious clothes?
        People who are gorgeously dressed and live in luxury are
        found in palaces.

007:026 But what did you go out to see?  A Prophet?  Aye, I tell you,
        and far more than a Prophet.

007:027 John is the man about whom it is written, `See, I am sending
        My messenger before thy face, and he shall make ready thy
        way before thee.'

007:028 "I tell you that among all of women born there is not one greater
        than John.  Yet one who is of lower rank in the Kingdom of God
        is greater than he.

007:029 And all the people, including the tax-gatherers, when they
        listened to him upheld the righteousness of God, by being
        baptized with John's baptism.

007:030 But the Pharisees and expounders of the Law have frustrated God's
        purpose as to their own lives, by refusing to be baptized.

007:031 "To what then shall I compare the men of the present generation,
        and what do they resemble?

007:032 They are like children sitting in the public square and calling
        out to one another, `We have played the flute to you,
        and you have not danced:  we have sung dirges, and you have
        not shown sorrow.'

007:033 For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking
        no wine, and you say, `He has a demon!'

007:034 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say,
        `Look, there is a man who is overfond of eating and drinking--
        he is a friend of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners!'

007:035 But wisdom is justified by all who are truly wise."

007:036 Now one of the Pharisees repeatedly invited Him to a meal at
        his house; so He entered the house and reclined at the table.

007:037 And there was a woman in the town who was a notorious sinner.
        Having learnt that Jesus was at table in the Pharisee's house
        she brought a flask of perfume,

007:038 and, standing behind close to His feet, weeping, began to wet
        His feet with her tears; and with her hair she wiped the tears
        away again, while she lovingly kissed His feet and poured
        the perfume over them.

007:039 Noticing this, the Pharisee, His host, said to himself,
        "This man, if he were really a Prophet, would know who and
        what sort of person this woman is who is touching him--
        and would know that she is an immoral woman."

007:040 In answer to his thoughts Jesus said to him, "Simon, I have
        a word to say to you."  "Rabbi, say on," he replied.

007:041 "There were once two men in debt to one money-lender," said Jesus;
        "one owed him five hundred shillings and the other fifty.

007:042 But neither of them could pay anything; so he freely forgave
        them both.  Tell me, then, which of them will love him most?"

007:043 "I suppose," replied Simon, "the one to whom he forgave most."
        "You have judged rightly," Jesus rejoined.

007:044 Then turning towards the woman He said to Simon, "Do you see
        this woman?  I came into your house:  you gave me no water
        for my feet; but she has made my feet wet with her tears,
        and then wiped the tears away with her hair.

007:045 No kiss did you give me; but she from the moment I came in has
        not left off tenderly kissing my feet.

007:046 No oil did you pour even on my head; but she has poured perfume
        upon my feet.

007:047 This is the reason why I tell you that her sins, her many sins,
        are forgiven--because she has loved much; but he who is
        forgiven little, loves little."

007:048 And He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."

007:049 Then the other guests began to say to themselves, "Who can
        this man be who even forgives sins?"

007:050 But He said to the woman, "Your faith has cured you:
        go, and be at peace."

008:001 Shortly after this He visited town after town, and village
        after village, proclaiming His Message and telling the Good News
        of the Kingdom of God.  The Twelve were with Him,

008:002 and certain women whom He had delivered from evil spirits
        and various diseases--Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven
        demons had come,

008:003 and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna,
        and many other women, all of whom contributed to the support
        of Jesus and His Apostles.

008:004 And when a great crowd was assembling, and was receiving additions
        from one town after another, He spoke a parable to them.

008:005 "The sower," He said, "goes out to sow his seed; and as he sows,
        some of the seed falls by the way-side, and is trodden upon,
        or the birds of the air come and peck it up.

008:006 Another part drops upon the rock, and after growing up it
        withers away for want of moisture.

008:007 Another part falls among the thorns, and the thorns grow up
        with it and stifle it.

008:008 But some of the seed falls into good ground, and grows up and
        yields a return of a hundred for one."  While thus speaking,
        He cried aloud and said, "Listen, every one who has ears
        to listen with!"

008:009 The disciples proceeded to ask Him what this parable meant.

008:010 "To you," He replied, "it is granted to know the secrets
        of the Kingdom of God; but all others are taught by parables,
        in order that they may see and yet not see, and may hear
        and yet not understand.

008:011 The meaning of the parable is as follows.  The seed
        is God's Message.

008:012 Those by the way-side are those who have heard, and then
        the Devil comes and carries away the Message from their hearts,
        lest they should believe and be saved.

008:013 Those on the rock are the people who on hearing the Message receive
        it joyfully; but they have no root:  for a time they believe,
        but when trial comes they fall away.

008:014 That which fell among the thorns means those who have heard,
        but as they go on their way, the Message is stifled by
        the anxieties, wealth and gaieties of time, and they yield
        nothing in perfection.

008:015 But as for that in the good ground, it means those who,
        having listened to the Message with open minds and in a
        right spirit, hold it fast, and patiently yield a return.

008:016 "When any one lights a lamp, he does not cover it with a
        vessel or hide it under a couch; he puts it on a lampstand,
        that people who enter the room may see the light.

008:017 There is nothing hidden, which shall not be openly seen;
        nor anything secret, which shall not be known and come into
        the light of day.

008:018 Be careful, therefore, how you hear; for whoever has anything,
        to him more shall be given, and whoever has nothing,
        even that which he thinks he has shall be taken away from him."

008:019 Then came to Him His mother and His brothers, but could not get
        near Him for the crowd.

008:020 But He was told, "Your mother and brothers are standing on
        the edge of the crowd, and want to see you."

008:021 "My mother and my brothers," He replied, "are these who hear
        God's Message and obey it."

008:022 One day He went on board a boat--both He and his disciples; and He
        said to them, "Let us cross over to the other side of the Lake."
        So they set sail.

002:023 During the passage He fell asleep, and there came down a squall
        of wind on the Lake, so that the boat began to fill and they
        were in deadly peril.

008:024 So they came and woke Him, crying, "Rabbi, Rabbi, we are drowning."
        Then He roused Himself and rebuked the wind and the surging
        of the water, and they ceased and there was a calm.

008:025 "Where is your faith?"  He asked them.  But they were filled
        with terror and amazement, and said to one another,
        "Who then is this? for He gives orders both to wind and waves,
        and they obey Him."

008:026 Then they put in to shore in the country of the Gerasenes,
        which lies opposite to Galilee.

008:027 Here, on landing, He was met by one of the townsmen who was
        possessed by demons--for a long time he had not put on any garment,
        nor did he live in a house, but in the tombs.

008:028 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him,
        and said in a loud voice, "What have you to do with me,
        Jesus, Son of God Most High?  Do not torture me, I beseech you."

008:029 For already He had been commanding the foul spirit to come
        out of the man.  For many a time it had seized and held him,
        and they had repeatedly put him in chains and fetters and kept
        guard over him, but he used to break the chains to pieces,
        and, impelled by the demon, to escape into the Desert.

008:030 "What is your name?"  Jesus asked him.  "Legion," he replied--
        because a great number of demons had entered into him;

008:031 and they besought Him not to command them to be gone into
        the Bottomless Pit.

008:032 Now there was a great herd of swine there feeding on the hill-side;
        and the demons begged Him to give them leave to go into them,
        and He gave them leave.

008:033 The demons came out of the man and left him, and entered
        into the swine; and the herd rushed violently over the cliff
        into the Lake and were drowned.

008:034 The swineherds, seeing what had happened, fled and reported
        it both in town and country;

008:035 whereupon the people came out to see what had happened.
        They came to Jesus, and they found the man from whom the demons
        had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his
        right mind; and they were terrified.

008:036 And those who had seen it told them how the demoniac was cured.

008:037 Then the whole population of the Gerasenes and of the adjacent
        districts begged Him to depart from them; for their terror
        was great.  So He went on board and returned.

008:038 But the man from whom the demons had gone out earnestly asked
        permission to go with Him; but He sent him away.

008:039 "Return home," He said, "and tell there all that God has done
        for you."  So he went and published through the whole town
        all that Jesus had done for him.

008:040 Now when Jesus was returning, the people gave Him a warm welcome;
        for they had all been looking out for Him.

008:041 Just then there came a man named Jair, a Warden of the Synagogue,
        who threw himself at the feet of Jesus, and entreated Him
        to come to his house;

008:042 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she
        was dying.  And as He went, the dense throng crowded on Him.

008:043 And a woman who for twelve years had been afflicted with haemorrhage--
        and had spent on doctors all she had, but none of them had
        been able to cure her--

008:044 came close behind Him and touched the tassel of His robe;
        and instantly her flow of blood stopped.

008:045 "Who is it touched me?"  Jesus asked.  And when all denied
        having done so, Peter and the rest said, "Rabbi, the crowds
        are hemming you in and pressing on you."

008:046 "Some one has touched me," Jesus replied, "for I feel that power
        has gone out from me."

008:047 Then the woman, perceiving that she had not escaped notice,
        came trembling, and throwing herself down at His feet she
        stated before all the people the reason why she had touched
        Him and how she was instantly cured.

008:048 "Daughter," said He, "your faith has cured you; go, and be at peace."

008:049 While He was still speaking, some one came to the Warden of
        the Synagogue from his house and said, "Your daughter is dead;
        trouble the Rabbi no further."

008:050 Jesus heard the words and said to him, "Have no fear.
        Only believe, and she shall be restored to life."

008:051 So He came to the house, but allowed no one to go in with Him
        but Peter and John and James and the girl's father and mother.

008:052 The people were all weeping aloud and beating their breasts for her;
        but He said, "Leave off wailing; for she is not dead, but asleep."

008:053 And they jeered at Him, knowing that she was dead.

008:054 He, however, took her by the hand and called aloud, "Child, awake!"

008:055 And her spirit returned, and instantly she stood up;
        and He directed them to give her some food.

008:056 Her parents were astounded; but He forbad them to mention
        the matter to any one.

009:001 Then calling the Twelve together He conferred on them power
        and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases;

009:002 and sent them out to proclaim the Kingdom of God and to
        cure the sick.

009:003 And He commanded them, "Take nothing for your journey;
        neither stick nor bag nor bread nor money; and do not have
        an extra under garment.

009:004 Whatever house you enter, make that your home, and from
        it start afresh.

009:005 Wherever they refuse to receive you, as you leave that town shake
        off the very dust from your feet as a protest against them."

009:006 So they departed and visited village after village,
        spreading the Good News and performing cures everywhere.

009:007 Now Herod the Tetrarch heard of all that was going on;
        and he was bewildered because of its being said by some
        that John had come back to life,

009:008 by others that Elijah had appeared, and by others that some
        one of the ancient Prophets had come back to life.

009:009 And Herod said, "John I have beheaded; but who is this,
        of whom I hear such reports?"  And he sought for an opportunity
        of seeing Jesus.

009:010 The Apostles, on their return, related to Jesus all they had done.
        Then He took them and withdrew to a quiet retreat,
        to a town called Bethsaida.

009:011 But the immense crowd, aware of this, followed Him; and receiving
        them kindly He proceeded to speak to them of the Kingdom of God,
        and those who needed to be restored to health, He cured.

009:012 Now when the day began to decline, the Twelve came to Him and said,
        "Send the people away, that they may go to the villages
        and farms round about and find lodging and a supply of food;
        because here we are in an uninhabited district."

009:013 "You yourselves," He said, "must give them food."
        "We have nothing," they replied, "but five loaves and a couple
        of fish, unless indeed we were to go and buy provisions
        for all this host of people."

009:014 (For there were about 5,000 adult men.)  But He said to His disciples,
        "Make them sit down in parties of about fifty each."

009:015 They did so, making them all, without exception, sit down.

009:016 Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking
        up to Heaven He blessed them and broke them into portions
        which He gave to the disciples to distribute to the people.

009:017 So they ate and were fully satisfied, all of them; and what they
        had remaining over was gathered up, twelve baskets of fragments.

009:018 One day when He was praying by Himself the disciples were present;
        and He asked them, "Who do the people say that I am?"

009:019 "John the Baptist," they replied; "but others say Elijah;
        and others that some one of the ancient Prophets has come
        back to life."

009:020 "But you," He asked, "who do you say that I am?"
        "God's Anointed One," replied Peter.

009:021 And Jesus strictly forbad them to tell this to any one;

009:022 and He said, "The Son of Man must suffer much cruelty, be rejected
        by the Elders and High Priests and Scribes, and be put to death,
        and on the third day be raised to life again."

009:023 And He said to all, "If any one is desirous of following me,
        let him ignore self and take up his cross day by day,
        and so be my follower.

009:024 For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it, and whoever
        loses his life for my sake shall save it.

009:025 Why, what benefit is it to a man to have gained the whole world,
        but to have lost or forfeited his own self.

009:026 For whoever shall have been ashamed of me and my teachings,
        of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His
        own and the Father's glory and in that of the holy angels.

009:027 I tell you truly that there are some of those who stand
        here who will certainly not taste death till they have seen
        the Kingdom of God."

009:028 It was about eight days after this that Jesus, taking with
        Him Peter, John, and James, went up the mountain to pray.

009:029 And while He was praying the appearance of His face underwent
        a change, and His clothing became white and radiant.

009:030 And suddenly there were two men conversing with Him, who were
        Moses and Elijah.

009:031 They came in glory, and kept speaking about His death,
        which He was so soon to undergo in Jerusalem.

009:032 Now Peter and the others were weighed down with sleep;
        but, keeping themselves awake all through, they saw His glory,
        and the two men standing with Him.

009:033 And when they were preparing to depart from Him, Peter said
        to Jesus, "Rabbi, we are thankful to you that we are here.
        Let us put up three tents--one for you, one for Moses,
        and one for Elijah."  He did not know what he was saying.

009:034 But while he was thus speaking, there came a cloud which spread
        over them; and they were awe-struck when they had entered
        into the cloud.

009:035 Then there came a voice from within the cloud:
        "This is My Son, My Chosen One:  listen to Him."

009:036 After this voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone.
        They kept it to themselves, and said not a word to any one
        at that time about what they had seen.

009:037 On the following day, when they were come down from the mountain,
        a great crowd came to meet Him;

009:038 and a man from the crowd called out, "Rabbi, I beg you to pity
        my son, for he is my only child.

009:039 At times a spirit seizes him and he suddenly cries out.
        It convulses him, and makes him foam at the mouth, and does
        not leave him till it has well-nigh covered him with bruises.

009:040 I entreated your disciples to expel the spirit, but they could not."

009:041 "O unbelieving and perverse generation!" replied Jesus;
        "how long shall I be with you and bear with you?
        Bring your son here to me."

009:042 Now while the youth was coming, the spirit dashed him to the ground
        and cruelly convulsed him.  But Jesus rebuked the foul spirit,
        and cured the youth and gave him back to his father.

009:043 And all were awe-struck at the mighty power of God.
        And while every one was expressing wonder at all that He
        was doing, He said to his disciples,

009:044 "As for you, store these my sayings in your memory; for, before long,
        the Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men."

009:045 But they did not understand His meaning:  it was veiled from
        them that they might not perceive it, and they were afraid
        to ask Him about it.

009:046 Now there arose a dispute among them, which of them was to
        be the greatest.

009:047 And Jesus, knowing the reasoning that was in their hearts,
        took a young child and made him stand by His side

009:048 and said to them, "Whoever for my sake receives this little child,
        receives me; and whoever receives me, receives Him who sent me.
        For the lowliest among you all--he is the greatest."

009:049 "Rabbi," replied John, "we have seen a man making use of your
        name to expel demons; and we forbad him, because he does
        not come with us."

009:050 "Do not forbid him," said Jesus, "for he who is not against you
        is on your side."

009:051 Now when the time drew near for Him to be received up again
        into Heaven, He proceeded with fixed purpose towards Jerusalem,
        and sent messengers before Him.

009:052 They went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make
        ready for Him.

009:053 But the people there would not receive Him, because He was
        evidently going to Jerusalem.

009:054 When the disciples James and John saw this, they said, "Master,
        do you wish us to order fire to come down from Heaven
        and consume them?"

009:055 But He turned and rebuked them.

009:056 And they went to another village.

009:057 And, as they proceeded on their way, a man came to Him and said,
        "I will follow you wherever you go."

009:058 "The foxes have holes," said Jesus, "and the birds of the air
        have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."

009:059 "Follow me," He said to another.  "Master," the man replied,
        "allow me first to go and bury my father."

009:060 "Leave the dead," Jesus rejoined, "to bury their own dead;
        but you must go and announce far and wide the coming of
        the Kingdom of God."

009:061 "Master," said yet another, "I will follow you; but allow me
        first to go and say good-bye to my friends at home."

009:062 Jesus answered him, "No one who has put his hand to the plough,
        and then looks behind him, is fit for the Kingdom of God.

010:001 After this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them
        before Him, by twos, to go to every town or place which
        He Himself intended to visit.

010:002 And He addressed them thus:  "The harvest is abundant,
        but the reapers are few:  therefore entreat the Owner
        of the harvest to send out more reapers into His fields.
        And now go.

010:003 Remember that I am sending you out as lambs into the midst of wolves.

010:004 Carry no purse, bag, nor change of shoes; and salute no one
        on your way."

010:005 "Whatever house you enter, first say, `Peace be to this house!'

010:006 And if there is a lover of peace there, your peace shall rest
        upon it; otherwise come back upon you.

010:007 And in that same house stay, eating and drinking at their table;
        for the labourer deserves his wages.  Do not move from one
        house to another.

010:008 "And whatever town you come to and they receive you,
        eat what they put before you.

010:009 Cure the sick in that town, and tell them, "`The Kingdom of God
        is now at your door.'

010:010 "But whatever town you come to and they will not receive you,
        go out into the broader streets and say,

010:011 "`The very dust of your town that hangs about us we wipe off
        as a protest.  Only be sure of this, that the Kingdom of God
        is close at hand.'

010:012 "I tell you that it will be more endurable for Sodom on
        the great day than for that town.

010:013 "Alas for thee, Chorazin!  Alas for thee, Bethsaida!  For had
        the miracles been performed in Tyre and Sidon which have been
        performed in you, long ere now they would have repented,
        sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

010:014 However, for Tyre and Sidon it will be more endurable at
        the Judgement than for you.

010:015 And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be lifted high as Heaven?  Thou shalt
        be driven down as low as Hades.

010:016 "He who listens to you listens to me; and he who disregards
        you disregards me, and he who disregards me disregards Him
        who sent me."

010:017 When the Seventy returned, they exclaimed joyfully, "Master,
        even the demons submit to us when we utter your name."

010:018 "I saw Satan fall like a lightning-flash out of Heaven," He replied.

010:019 "I have given you power to tread serpents and scorpions underfoot,
        and to trample on all the power of the Enemy; and in no case
        shall anything do you harm.

010:020 Nevertheless rejoice not at this, that the spirits submit to you;
        but rejoice that your names are registered in Heaven."

010:021 On that same occasion Jesus was filled by the Holy Spirit
        with rapturous joy.  "I give Thee fervent thanks,"
        He exclaimed, "O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that Thou
        hast hidden these things from sages and men of understanding,
        and hast revealed them to babes.  Yes, Father, for such has
        been Thy gracious will.

010:022 All things are delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows
        who the Son is but the Father, nor who the Father is but the Son,
        and he to whom the Son may choose to reveal Him."

010:023 And He turned towards His disciples and said to them apart,
        "Blessed are the eyes which see what you see!

010:024 For I tell you that many Prophets and kings have desired to see
        the things you see, and have not seen them, and to hear
        the things you hear, and have not heard them."

010:025 Then an expounder of the Law stood up to test Him with a question.
        "Rabbi," he asked, "what shall I do to inherit the Life
        of the Ages?"

010:026 "Go to the Law," said Jesus; "what is written there? how
        does it read?"

010:027 "`Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,'" he replied, "`with thy
        whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole strength, and thy whole mind;
        and thy fellow man as much as thyself.'"

010:028 "A right answer," said Jesus; "do that, and you shall live."

010:029 But he, desiring to justify himself, said, "But what is meant
        by my `fellow man'?"

010:030 Jesus replied, "A man was once on his way down from Jerusalem
        to Jericho when he fell among robbers, who after both stripping
        and beating him went away, leaving him half dead.

010:031 Now a priest happened to be going down that way, and on seeing
        him passed by on the other side.

010:032 In like manner a Levite also came to the place, and seeing
        him passed by on the other side.

010:033 But a certain Samaritan, being on a journey, came where he lay,
        and seeing him was moved with pity.

010:034 He went to him, and dressed his wounds with oil and wine and
        bound them up.  Then placing him on his own mule he brought
        him to an inn, where he bestowed every care on him.

010:035 The next day he took out two shillings and gave them to
        the innkeeper.  "`Take care of him,' he said, `and whatever
        further expense you are put to, I will repay it you at
        my next visit.'

010:036 "Which of those three seems to you to have acted like a fellow
        man to him who fell among the robbers?"

010:037 "The one who showed him pity," he replied.  "Go," said Jesus,
        "and act in the same way."

010:038 As they pursued their journey He came to a certain village,
        where a woman named Martha welcomed Him to her house.

010:039 She had a sister called Mary, who seated herself at the Lord's
        feet and listened to His teaching.

010:040 Martha meanwhile was busy and distracted in waiting at table,
        and she came and said, "Master, do you not care that my sister
        is leaving me to do all the waiting?  Tell her to assist me."

010:041 "Martha, Martha," replied Jesus, "you are anxious and worried
        about a multitude of things;

010:042 and yet only one thing is really necessary.  Mary has chosen
        the good portion and she shall not be deprived of it."

011:001 At one place where He was praying, when He rose from His knees
        one of His disciples said to Him, "Master, teach us to pray,
        just as John taught his disciples."

011:002 So He said to them, "When you pray, say, `Father may Thy name
        be kept holy; let Thy Kingdom come;

011:003 give us day after day our bread for the day;

011:004 and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive every one
        who fails in his duty to us; and bring us not into temptation.'"

011:005 And He said to them, "Which of you shall have a friend and shall
        go to him in the middle of the night and say, "`Friend, lend me
        three loaves of bread;

011:006 for a friend of mine has just come to my house from a distance,
        and I have nothing for him to eat'?

011:007 "And he from indoors shall answer, "`Do not pester me.
        The door is now barred, and I am here in bed with my children.
        I cannot get up and give you bread.'

011:008 "I tell you that even if he will not rise and give him the loaves
        because he is his friend, at any rate because of his persistency
        he will rouse himself and give him as many as he requires.

011:009 "So I say to you, `Ask, and what you ask for shall be given
        to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and the door shall
        be opened to you.'

011:010 For every one who asks, receives; and he who seeks, finds;
        and to him who knocks, the door shall be opened.

011:011 And what father is there among you, who, if his son asks
        for a slice of bread, will offer him a stone? or if he asks
        for a fish, will instead of a fish offer him a snake?

011:012 or if he asks for an egg, will offer him a scorpion?

011:013 If you then, with all your human frailty, know how to give
        your children gifts that are good for them, how much more
        certainly will your Father who is in Heaven give the Holy Spirit
        to those who ask Him!"

011:014 On once occasion He was expelling a dumb demon;
        and when the demon was gone out the dumb man could speak,
        and the people were astonished.

011:015 But some among them said, "It is by the power of Baal-zebul,
        the Prince of the demons, that he expels the demons."

011:016 Others, to put Him to the test, asked Him for a sign in the sky.

011:017 And, knowing their thoughts, He said to them, "Every kingdom
        in which civil war rages goes to ruin:  family attacks family
        and is overthrown.

011:018 And if Satan really has engaged in fierce conflict with himself,
        how shall his kingdom stand?--because you say that I expel
        demons by the power of Baal-zebul.

011:019 And if it is by the power of Baal-zebul that I expel the demons,
        by whom do your disciples expel them?  They therefore shall
        be your judges.

011:020 But if it is by the power of God that I drive out the demons,
        it is evident that the Kingdom of God has come upon you.

011:021 "Whenever a strong man, fully armed and equipped, is guarding
        his own castle, he enjoys peaceful possession of his property;

011:022 but as soon as another stronger than he attacks him and overcomes him,
        he takes away that complete armour of his in which he trusted,
        and distributes the plunder he has collected.

011:023 Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever is not
        gathering with me is scattering abroad.

011:024 "When a foul spirit has left a man, it roams about in the Desert,
        seeking a resting-place; but, unable to find any, it says,
        `I will return to the house I have left;"

011:025 and when it comes, it finds the house swept clean and
        in good order.

011:026 Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more
        malignant than itself, and they enter and dwell there;
        and in the end that man's condition becomes worse than it
        was at first.

011:027 As He thus spoke a woman in the crowd called out in a loud voice,
        "Blessed is the mother who carried you, and the breasts
        that you have sucked."

011:028 "Nay rather," He replied, "they are blessed who hear God's Message
        and carefully keep it."

011:029 Now when the crowds came thronging upon Him, He proceeded
        to say, "The present generation is a wicked generation:
        it requires some sign, but no sign shall be given to it except
        that of Jonah.

011:030 For just as Jonah became a sign to the men of Nineveh,
        so the Son of Man will be a token to the present generation.

011:031 The Queen of the South will awake at the Judgement together
        with the men of the present generation, and will condemn them;
        because she came from the extremity of the earth to hear the wisdom
        of Solomon; but mark!  One greater than Solomon is here.

011:032 There will stand up men of Nineveh at the Judgement
        together with the present generation, and will condemn it;
        because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and mark!
        One greater than Jonah is here.

011:033 "When any one lights a lamp, he never puts it in the cellar
        or under the bushel, but on the lampstand, that people who come
        in may see the light.

011:034 The lamp of the body is the eye.  When your eyesight is good,
        your whole body also is lighted up; but when it is defective,
        your body is darkened.

011:035 Consider therefore whether the light that is in you is anything
        but mere darkness.

011:036 If, however, your whole body is penetrated with light,
        and has no part dark, it will be so lighted, all of it,
        as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light."

011:037 When He had thus spoken, a Pharisee invited Him to breakfast
        at his house; so He entered and took His place at table.

011:038 Now the Pharisee saw to his surprise that He did not wash His
        hands before breakfasting.

011:039 The Master however said to him, "Here we see how you Pharisees
        clean the outside of the cup or plate, while your secret
        hearts are full of greed and selfishness.

011:040 Foolish men!  Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?

011:041 But as to what is within, give alms, and instantly all is
        clean in you.

011:042 "But alas for you Pharisees! for you pay tithes on your mint
        and rue and every kind of garden vegetable, and are indifferent
        to justice and the love of God.  These are the things you
        ought to have attended to, while not neglecting the others.

011:043 Alas for you Pharisees! for you love the best seats in the synagogues,
        and you like to be bowed to in places of public resort.

011:044 Alas for you! for you are like the tombs which lie hidden,
        and the people who walk over them are not aware of their existence."

011:045 Hereupon one of the expounders of the Law exclaimed, "Rabbi,
        in saying such things you reproach us also."

011:046 "Alas too for you expounders of the Law!" replied Jesus,
        "for you load men with cumbrous burdens which you yourselves
        will not touch with one of your fingers.

011:047 Alas for you! for you repair the tombs of the Prophets,
        whom your forefathers killed.

011:048 It follows that you bear testimony to the actions of
        your forefathers and that you fully approve thereof.
        They slew, you build.

011:049 "For this reason also the Wisdom of God has said, `I will send
        Prophets and Apostles to them, of whom they will kill some
        and persecute others,'

011:050 so that the blood of all the Prophets, that is being shed
        from the creation of the world onwards, may be required
        from the present generation.

011:051 Yes, I tell you that, from the blood of Abel down to the blood
        of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the House,
        it shall all be required from the present generation.

011:052 "Alas for you expounders of the Law! for you have taken away
        the key of knowledge:  you yourselves have not entered,
        and those who wanted to enter you have hindered."

011:053 After He had left the house, the Scribes and Pharisees commenced
        a vehement attempt to entangle Him and make Him give off-hand
        answers on numerous points,

011:054 lying in wait to catch some unguarded expression from His lips.

012:001 Meanwhile the people had come streaming towards Him by tens
        of thousands, so that they were trampling one another under foot.
        And now He proceeded to say to His disciples first,
        "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, that is to say,
        beware of hypocrisy.

012:002 There is nothing that is covered up which will not be uncovered,
        nor hidden which will not become known.

012:003 Whatever therefore you have said in the dark, will be heard
        in the light; and what you have whispered within closed doors
        will be proclaimed from the house-tops.

012:004 "But to you who are my friends I say, "`Be not afraid of those
        who kill the body and after that can do nothing further.

012:005 I will warn you whom to fear:  fear him who after killing has
        power to throw into Gehenna:  yes, I say to you, fear him.

012:006 Are not five sparrows sold for a penny? and yet not one of them
        is a thing forgotten in God's sight.

012:007 But the very hairs on your heads are all counted.  Away with fear:
        you are more precious than a multitude of sparrows.'

012:008 "And I tell you that every man who shall have acknowledged
        me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before
        the angels of God.

012:009 But he who disowns me before men will be disowned before
        the angels of God.

012:010 "Moreover every one who shall speak against the Son of Man,
        may obtain forgiveness; but he who blasphemes the Holy Spirit
        will never obtain forgiveness.

012:011 And when they are bringing you before synagogues and magistrates
        and governors, do not anxiously ponder the manner or matter
        of your defence, nor what you are to say;

012:012 for the Holy Spirit shall teach you at that very moment
        what you must say."

012:013 Just then a man in the crowd appealed to Him.  "Rabbi," he said,
        "tell my brother to give me a share of the inheritance."

012:014 "Man," He replied, "who has constituted me a judge or
        arbitrator over you?"

012:015 And to the people He said, "Take care, be on your guard
        against all covetousness, for no one's life consists in
        the superabundance of his possessions."

012:016 And He spoke a parable to them.  "A certain rich man's lands,"
        He said, "yielded abundant crops,

012:017 and he debated within himself, saying, "`What am I to do?
        for I have no place in which to store my crops.'

012:018 "And he said to himself, "`This is what I will do:
        I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and in them
        I will store up all my harvest and my wealth;

012:019 and I will say to my life, "`Life, you have ample possessions
        laid up for many years to come:  take your ease,
        eat, drink, enjoy yourself.'

012:020 "But God said to him, "`Foolish man, this night your life
        is demanded from you; and these preparations--for whom
        shall they be?'

012:021 "So is it with him who amasses treasure for himself, but has
        no riches in God."

012:022 Then turning to His disciples He said, "For this reason
        I say to you, `Dismiss all anxious care for your lives,
        inquiring what you are to eat, and for your bodies, what you
        are to put on.'

012:023 For life is a greater gift than food, and the body is a greater
        gift than clothing.

012:024 Observe the ravens.  They neither sow nor reap, and have
        neither store-chamber nor barn.  And yet God feeds them.
        How far more precious are you than the birds!

012:025 And which of you is able by anxious thought to add a moment
        to his life?

012:026 If then you are unable to do even a very little thing,
        why be over-anxious about other matters?

012:027 Observe the lilies, how they grow.  They neither labour nor spin.
        And yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendour
        was as beautifully dressed as one of these.

012:028 But if God so clothes the vegetation in the fields, that blooms
        to-day and to-morrow will be thrown into the oven, how much
        more certainly will He clothe you, you men of feeble faith!

012:029 "Therefore, do not be asking what you are to eat nor what you
        are to drink; and do not waver between hope and fear.

012:030 For though the nations of the world pursue these things,
        as for you, your Father knows that you need them.

012:031 But make His Kingdom the object of your pursuit, and these things
        shall be given you in addition.

012:032 "Dismiss your fears, little flock:  your Father finds a pleasure
        in giving you the Kingdom.

012:033 Sell your possessions and give alms.  Provide yourselves with purses
        that will never wear out, a treasure inexhaustible in Heaven,
        where no thief can come nor moth consume.

012:034 For where your wealth is stored, there also will your heart be.

012:035 "Have your girdles on, and let your lamps be alight;

012:036 and be yourselves like men waiting for their master--
        on the look-out till he shall return from the wedding feast--
        that, when he comes and knocks, they may open the door instantly.

012:037 Blessed are those servants, whom their Master when He comes
        shall find on the watch.  I tell you in solemn truth,
        that He will tie an apron round Him, and will bid them recline
        at table while He comes and waits on them.

012:038 And whether it be in the second watch or in the third that He
        comes and finds them so, blessed are they.

012:039 Of this be sure, that if the master of the house had known
        what time the robber was coming, he would have kept awake
        and not have allowed his house to be broken into.

012:040 Be you also ready, for at an hour when you are not expecting
        Him the Son of Man will come."

012:041 "Master," said Peter, "are you addressing this parable to us,
        or to all alike?"

012:042 "Who, then," replied the Lord, "is the faithful and intelligent
        steward whom his Master will put in charge of His household
        to serve out their rations at the proper times?

012:043 Blessed is that servant whom his Master when He comes shall
        find so doing.

012:044 I tell you truly that He will put him in authority over
        all His possessions.

012:045 But if that servant should say in his heart, `My Master is a long
        time in coming,' and should begin to beat the menservants
        and the maids, and to eat and drink, drinking even to excess;

012:046 that servant's Master will come on a day when he is not expecting
        Him and at an hour that he knows not of, and will punish
        him severely, and make him share the lot of the unfaithful.

012:047 And that servant who has been told his Master's will
        and yet made no preparation and did not obey His will,
        will receive many lashes.

012:048 But he who had not been told it and yet did what deserved
        the scourge, will receive but few lashes.  To whomsoever
        much has been given, from him much will be required;
        and to whom much has been entrusted, of him a larger amount
        will be demanded.

012:049 "I came to throw fire upon the earth, and what is my desire?
        Oh that it were even now kindled!

012:050 But I have a baptism to undergo; and how am I pent up till
        it is accomplished!

012:051 Do you suppose that I came to give peace on earth?  No, I tell
        you that I came to bring dissension.

012:052 For from this time there will be in one house five persons
        split into parties.  Three will form a party against two
        and two will form a party against three;

012:053 father against son and son against father; mother attacking daughter
        and daughter her mother, mother-in-law her daughter-in-law,
        and daughter-in-law her mother-in-law."

012:054 Then He said to the people also, "When you see a cloud rising
        in the west, you immediately say, `There is to be a shower;'
        and it comes to pass.

012:055 And when you see a south wind blowing, you say, `It will be
        burning hot;' and it comes to pass.

012:056 Vain pretenders!  You know how to read the aspect of earth and sky.
        How is it you cannot read this present time?

012:057 "Why, too, do you not of yourselves arrive at just conclusions?

012:058 For when, with your opponent, you are going before the magistrate,
        on the way take pains to get out of his power; for fear that,
        if he should drag you before the judge, the judge may hand
        you over to the officer of the court, and the officer lodge
        you in prison.

012:059 Never, I tell you, will you get free till you have paid
        the last farthing."

013:001 Just at that time people came to tell Him about the Galilaeans
        whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

013:002 "Do you suppose," He asked in reply, "that those Galilaeans
        were worse sinners than the mass of the Galilaeans,
        because this happened to them?

013:003 I tell you, certainly not.  On the contrary, if you are not
        penitent you will all perish as they did.

013:004 Or those eighteen on whom the tower at Siloam fell, do you
        suppose they had failed in their duty more than all the rest
        of the people who live in Jerusalem?

013:005 I tell you, certainly not.  On the contrary, if you do not
        repent you will all perish just as they did."

013:006 And He gave them the following parable.  "A man," He said,
        "who had a fig-tree growing in his garden came to look
        for fruit on it and could find none.

013:007 So he said to the gardener, "`See, this is the third year I have
        come to look for fruit on this fig-tree and cannot find any.
        Cut it down.  Why should so much ground be actually wasted?'

013:008 "But the gardener pleaded, "`Leave it, Sir, this year also,
        till I have dug round it and manured it.

013:009 If after that it bears fruit, well and good; if it does not,
        then you shall cut it down.'"

013:010 Once He was teaching on the Sabbath in one of the synagogues

013:011 where a woman was present who for eighteen years had been
        a confirmed invalid:  she was bent double, and was unable
        to lift herself to her full height.

013:012 But Jesus saw her, and calling to her, He said to her, "Woman,
        you are free from your weakness."

013:013 And He put His hands on her, and she immediately stood upright
        and began to give glory to God.

013:014 Then the Warden of the Synagogue, indignant that Jesus
        had cured her on a Sabbath, said to the crowd, "There are
        six days in the week on which people ought to work.
        On those days therefore come and get yourselves cured,
        and not on the Sabbath day."

013:015 But the Lord's reply to him was, "Hypocrites, does not each of you
        on the Sabbath untie his bullock or his ass from the stall
        and lead him to water?

013:016 And this woman, daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan
        had bound for no less than eighteen years, was she not to be
        loosed from this chain because it is the Sabbath day?"

013:017 When He had said this, all His opponents were ashamed,
        while the whole multitude was delighted at the many glorious
        things continually done by Him.

013:018 This prompted Him to say, "What is the Kingdom of God like?
        and to what shall I compare it?

013:019 It is like a mustard seed which a man drops into the soil
        in his garden, and it grows and becomes a tree in whose
        branches the birds roost."

013:020 And again He said, "To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?

013:021 It is like yeast which a woman takes and buries in a bushel
        of flour, to work there till the whole is leavened."

013:022 He was passing through town after town and village after village,
        steadily proceeding towards Jerusalem,

013:023 when some one asked Him, "Sir, are there but few who are
        to be saved?"

013:024 "Strain every nerve to force your way in through the narrow gate,"
        He answered; "for multitudes, I tell you, will endeavour
        to find a way in and will not succeed.

013:025 As soon as the Master of the house shall have risen and shut the door,
        and you have begun to stand outside and knock at the door
        and say, "`Sir, open the door for us'--"`I do not know you,'
        He answers; `you are no friends of mine.'

013:026 "Then you will plead, "`We have eaten and drunk in your company
        and you have taught in our streets.'

013:027 "But He will reply, "`I tell you that you are no friends of mine.
        Begone from me, all of you, wrongdoers that you are.'

013:028 "There will be the weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see
        Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the Prophets in the Kingdom
        of God, and yourselves being driven far away.

013:029 They will come from east and west, from north and south,
        and will sit down at the banquet in the Kingdom of God.

013:030 And I tell you that some now last will then be first,
        and some now first will then be last."

013:031 Just at that time there came some Pharisees who warned Him,
        saying, "Leave this place and continue your journey;
        Herod means to kill you."

013:032 "Go," He replied, "and take this message to that fox:
        "`See, to-day and to-morrow I am driving out demons and
        effecting cures, and on the third day I finish my course.'

013:033 "Yet I must continue my journey to-day and to-morrow and
        the day following; for it is not conceivable that a Prophet
        should perish outside of Jerusalem.

013:034 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou who murderest the Prophets
        and stonest those who have been sent to thee, how often
        have I desired to gather thy children just as a hen gathers
        her brood under her wings, and you would not come!

013:035 See, your house is left to you.  But I tell you that you will
        never see me again until you say, `Blessed is He who comes
        in the name of the Lord!'"

014:001 One day--it was a Sabbath--He was taking a meal at the house
        of one of the Rulers of the Pharisee party, while they were
        closely watching Him.

014:002 In front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy.

014:003 This led Jesus to ask the lawyers and Pharisees, "Is it
        allowable to cure people on the Sabbath?"

014:004 They gave Him no answer; so He took hold of the man, cured him,
        and sent him away.

014:005 Then He turned to them and said, "Which of you shall have
        a child or an ox fall into a well on the Sabbath day,
        and will not immediately lift him out?"

014:006 To this they could make no reply.

014:007 Then, when He noticed that the invited guests chose the best seats,
        He used this as an illustration and said to them,

014:008 "When any one invites you to a wedding banquet, do not take
        the best seat, lest perhaps some more honoured guest than you
        may have been asked,

014:009 and the man who invited you both will come and will say to you,
        `Make room for this guest,' and then you, ashamed, will move
        to the lowest place.

014:010 On the contrary, when you are invited go and take the lowest place,
        that when your host comes round he may say to you, `My friend,
        come up higher.'  This will be doing you honour in the presence
        of all the other guests.

014:011 For whoever uplifts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles
        himself will be uplifted.

014:012 Also to His host, who had invited Him, He said, "When you
        give a breakfast or a dinner, do not invite your friends
        or brothers or relatives or rich neighbours, lest perhaps
        they should invite you in return and a requital be made you.

014:013 But when you entertain, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame,
        and the blind;

014:014 and you will be blessed, because they have no means of requiting you,
        but there will be requital for you at the Resurrection
        of the righteous."

014:015 After listening to this teaching, one of His fellow guests said
        to Him, "Blessed is he who shall feast in God's Kingdom."

014:016 "A man once gave a great dinner," replied Jesus, "to which
        he invited a large number of guests.

014:017 At dinner-time he sent his servant to announce to those who had
        been invited, "`Come, for things are now ready.'

014:018 "But they all without exception began to excuse themselves.
        The first told him, "`I have purchased a piece of land,
        and must of necessity go and look at it.  Pray hold me excused.'

014:019 "A second pleaded, "`I have bought five yoke of oxen, and am
        on my way to try them.  Pray hold me excused.'

014:020 "Another said, "`I am just married.  It is impossible for
        me to come.'

014:021 "So the servant came and brought these answers to his master,
        and they stirred his anger.  "`Go out quickly,' he said,
        `into the streets of the city--the wide ones and the narrow.
        You will see poor men, and crippled, blind, lame:  fetch them
        all in here.'

014:022 "Soon the servant reported the result, saying, "`Sir, what you
        ordered is done, and there is room still.'

014:023 "`Go out,' replied the master, `to the high roads and hedge-rows,
        and compel the people to come in, so that my house may be filled.

014:024 For I tell you that not one of those who were invited shall
        taste my dinner.'"

014:025 On His journey vast crowds attended Him, towards whom He
        turned and said,

014:026 "If any one is coming to me who does not hate his father
        and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters,
        yes and his own life also, he cannot be a disciple of mine.

014:027 No one who does not carry his own cross and come after me can
        be a disciple of mine.

014:028 "Which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not sit down
        first and calculate the cost, asking if he has the means
        to finish it?--

014:029 lest perhaps, when he has laid the foundation and is unable
        to finish, all who see it shall begin to jeer at him,

014:030 saying, `This man began to build, but could not finish.'

014:031 Or what king, marching to encounter another king in war,
        does not first sit down and deliberate whether he is able
        with ten thousand men to meet the one who is advancing against
        him with twenty thousand?

014:032 If not, while the other is still a long way off, he sends
        messengers and sues for peace.

014:033 Just as no one of you who does not detach himself from all
        that belongs to him can be a disciple of mine.

014:034 "Salt is good:  but if even the salt has become tasteless,
        what will you use to season it?

014:035 Neither for land nor dunghill is it of any use; they throw
        it away.  Listen, every one who has ears to listen with!"

015:001 Now the tax-gatherers and the notorious sinners were everywhere
        in the habit of coming close to Him to listen to Him;

015:002 and this led the Pharisees and the Scribes indignantly
        to complain, saying, "He gives a welcome to notorious sinners,
        and joins them at their meals!"

015:003 So in figurative language He asked them,

015:004 "Which of you men, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost
        one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in their pasture
        and go in search of the lost one till he finds it?

015:005 And when he has found it, he lifts it on his shoulder,
        glad at heart.

015:006 Then coming home he calls his friends and neighbours together,
        and says, `Congratulate me, for I have found my sheep--
        the one I had lost.'

015:007 I tell you that in the same way there will be rejoicing in Heaven
        over one repentant sinner--more rejoicing than over ninety-nine
        blameless persons who have no need of repentance.

015:008 "Or what woman who has ten silver coins, if she loses one of them,
        does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully
        till she finds it?

015:009 And when she has found it, she calls together her friends
        and neighbours, and says, "`Congratulate me, for I have found
        the coin which I had lost.'

015:010 "I tell you that in the same way there is rejoicing in the presence
        of the angels of God over one repentant sinner."

015:011 He went on to say, "There was a man who had two sons.

015:012 The younger of them said to his father, "`Father, give me
        the share of the property that comes to me.'  "So he divided
        his wealth between them.

015:013 No long time afterwards the younger son got all together
        and travelled to a distant country, where he wasted his money
        in debauchery and excess.

015:014 At last, when he had spent everything, there came a terrible
        famine throughout that country, and he began to feel
        the pinch of want.

015:015 So he went and hired himself to one of the inhabitants
        of that country, who sent him on to his farm to tend swine;

015:016 and he longed to make a hearty meal of the pods the swine
        were eating, but no one gave him any.

015:017 "But on coming to himself he said, "`How many of my father's
        hired men have more bread than they want, while I here am
        dying of hunger!

015:018 I will rise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have
        sinned against Heaven and before you:

015:019 I no longer deserve to be called a son of yours:
        treat me as one of your hired men.'

015:020 "So he rose and came to his father.  But while he was still
        a long way off, his father saw him and pitied him, and ran
        and threw his arms round his neck and kissed him tenderly.

015:021 "`Father,' cried the son, `I have sinned against Heaven
        and before you:  no longer do I deserve to be called
        a son of yours.'

015:022 "But the father said to his servants, "`Fetch a good coat quickly--
        the best one--and put it on him; and bring a ring for his
        finger and shoes for his feet.

015:023 Fetch the fat calf and kill it, and let us feast and enjoy ourselves;

015:024 for my son here was dead and has come to life again:
        he was lost and has been found.'  "And they began to be merry.

015:025 "Now his elder son was out on the farm; and when he returned
        and came near home, he heard music and dancing.

015:026 Then he called one of the lads to him and asked what all this meant.

015:027 "`Your brother has come,' he replied; `and your father
        has had the fat calf killed, because he has got him home
        safe and sound.'

015:028 "Then he was angry and would not go in.  But his father came
        out and entreated him.

015:029 "`All these years,' replied the son, `I have been slaving for you,
        and I have never at any time disobeyed any of your orders,
        and yet you have never given me so much as a kid, for me
        to enjoy myself with my friends;

015:030 but now that this son of yours is come who has eaten up
        your property among his bad women, you have killed the fat
        calf for him.'

015:031 "`You my dear son,' said the father, `are always with me,
        and all that is mine is also yours.

015:032 We are bound to make merry and rejoice, for this brother
        of yours was dead and has come back to life, he was lost
        and has been found.'"

016:001 He said also to His disciples:  "There was a rich man
        who had a steward, about whom a report was brought to him,
        that he was wasting his property.

016:002 He called him and said, "`What is this I hear about you?
        Render an account of your stewardship, for I cannot let you
        hold it any longer.'

016:003 "Then the steward said within himself, "`What am I to do?
        For my master is taking away the stewardship from me.
        I am not strong enough for field labour:  to beg,
        I should be ashamed.

016:004 I see what to do, in order that when I am discharged from
        the stewardship they may give me a home in their own houses.'

016:005 "So he called all his master's debtors, one by one, and asked
        the first, `How much are you in debt to my master?'

016:006 "`A hundred firkins of oil,' he replied.  "`Here is your account,'
        said the steward:  `sit down quickly and change it
        into fifty firkins.'

016:007 "To a second he said, "`And how much do you owe?'  "`A hundred
        quarters of wheat,' was the answer.  "`Here is your account,'
        said he:  `change it into eighty quarters.'

016:008 "And the master praised the dishonest steward for his shrewdness;
        for, in relation to their own contemporaries, the men of this
        age are shrewder than the sons of Light.

016:009 "But I charge you, so to use the wealth which is ever
        tempting to dishonesty as to win friends who, when it fails,
        shall welcome you to the tents that never perish.

016:010 The man who is honest in a very small matter is honest
        in a great one also; and he who is dishonest in a very small
        matter is dishonest in a great one also.

016:011 If therefore you have not proved yourselves faithful in dealing
        with the wealth that is tainted with fraud, who will entrust
        to you the true good?

016:012 And if you have not been faithful in dealing with that which is
        not your own, who will give you that which is your own?

016:013 "No servant can be in bondage to two masters.
        For either he will hate one and love the other,
        or else he will cling fast to one and scorn the other.
        You cannot be bondservants both of God and of gold."

016:014 To all this the Pharisees listened, bitterly jeering at Him;
        for they were lovers of money.

016:015 "You are they," He said to them, "who boast of their own goodness
        before men, but God sees your hearts; for that which holds
        a proud position among men is detestable in God's sight.

016:016 The Law and the Prophets continued until John came:
        from that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God has
        been spreading, and all classes have been forcing their
        way into it.

016:017 But it is easier for earth and sky to pass away than for one
        smallest detail of the Law to fall to the ground.

016:018 Every man who divorces his wife and marries another
        commits adultery; and he who marries her when so divorced
        from her husband commits adultery.

016:019 "There was once a rich man who habitually arrayed himself in purple
        and fine linen, and enjoyed a splendid banquet every day,

016:020 while at his outer door there lay a beggar, Lazarus by name,

016:021 covered with sores and longing to make a full meal off
        the scraps flung on the floor from the rich man's table.
        Nay, the dogs, too, used to come and lick his sores.

016:022 "But in course of time the beggar died; and he was carried
        by the angels into Abraham's bosom.  The rich man also died,
        and had a funeral.

016:023 And in Hades, being in torment, he looked and saw Abraham
        in the far distance, and Lazarus resting in his arms.

016:024 So he cried aloud, and said, "`Father Abraham, take pity
        on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water
        and cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.'

016:025 "`Remember, my child,' said Abraham, `that you had all
        your good things during your lifetime, and that Lazarus
        in like manner had his bad things.  But, now and here,
        he is receiving consolation and you are in agony.

016:026 And, besides all this, a vast chasm is immovably fixed between
        us and you, put there in order that those who desire to cross
        from this side to you may not be able, nor any be able to cross
        over from your side to us.'

016:027 "`I entreat you then, father,' said he, `to send him to
        my father's house.

016:028 For I have five brothers.  Let him earnestly warn them,
        lest they also come to this place of torment.'

016:029 "`They have Moses and the Prophets,' replied Abraham;
        `let them hear them.'

016:030 "`No, father Abraham,' he pleaded; `but if some one goes
        to them from the dead, they will repent.'

016:031 "`If they are deaf to Moses and the Prophets,' replied Abraham,
        `they would not be led to believe even if some one should rise
        from the dead.'"

017:001 Jesus said to His disciples, "It is inevitable that causes of
        stumbling should come; but alas for him through whom they come!

017:002 It would be well for him if, with a millstone round his neck,
        he were lying at the bottom of the sea, rather than that
        he should cause even one of these little ones to fall.

017:003 Be on your guard.  "If your brother acts wrongly, reprove him;
        and if he is sorry, forgive him;

017:004 and if seven times in a day he acts wrongly towards you,
        and seven times turns again to you and says, `I am sorry,'
        you must forgive him."

017:005 And the Apostles said to the Lord, "Give us faith."

017:006 "If your faith," replied the Lord, "is like a mustard seed,
        you might command this black-mulberry-tree, `Tear up your
        roots and plant yourself in the sea,' and instantly it
        would obey you.

017:007 But which of you who has a servant ploughing, or tending sheep,
        will say to him when he comes in from the farm, `Come at once
        and take your place at table,'

017:008 and will not rather say to him, `Get my dinner ready,
        make yourself tidy, and wait upon me till I have finished
        my dinner, and then you shall have yours'?

017:009 Does he thank the servant for obeying his orders?

017:010 So you also, when you have obeyed all the orders given you,
        must say, "`There is no merit in our service:  what we have
        done is only what we were in duty bound to do.'"

017:011 As they pursued their journey to Jerusalem, He passed through
        Samaria and Galilee.

017:012 And as He entered a certain village, ten men met Him who were
        lepers and stood at a distance.

017:013 In loud voices they cried out, "Jesus, Rabbi, take pity on us."

017:014 Perceiving this, He said to them, "Go and show yourselves
        to the Priests."  And while on their way to do this they
        were made clean.

017:015 One of them, seeing that he was cured, came back, adoring and
        praising God in a loud voice,

017:016 and he threw himself at the feet of Jesus, thanking Him.
        He was a Samaritan.

017:017 "Were not all ten made clean?"  Jesus asked; "but where
        are the nine?

017:018 Have none been found to come back and give glory to God
        except this foreigner?"

017:019 And He said to him, "Rise and go:  your faith has cured you."

017:020 Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God was coming,
        He answered, "The Kingdom of God does not so come that you
        can stealthily watch for it.

017:021 Nor will they say, `See here!' or `See there!'--for the Kingdom
        of God is within you."

017:022 Then, turning to His disciples, He said, "There will come a time
        when you will wish you could see a single one of the days
        of the Son of Man, but will not see one.

017:023 And they will say to you, `See there!'  `See here!'
        Do not start off and go in pursuit.

017:024 For just as the lightning, when it flashes, shines from one part
        of the horizon to the opposite part, so will the Son of Man
        be on His day.

017:025 But first He must endure much suffering, and be rejected
        by the present generation.

017:026 "And as it was in the time of Noah, so will it also be in the time
        of the Son of Man.

017:027 Men were eating and drinking, taking wives and giving wives,
        up to the very day on which Noah entered the Ark, and the Deluge
        came and destroyed them all.

017:028 The same was true in the time of Lot:  they were eating
        and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building;

017:029 but on the day that Lot left Sodom, God rained fire and brimstone
        from the sky and destroyed them all.

017:030 Exactly so will it be on the day that the veil is lifted
        from the Son of Man.

017:031 "On that day, if a man is on the roof and his property indoors,
        let him not go down to fetch it; and, in the same way,
        he who is in the field, let him not turn back.

017:032 Remember Lot's wife.

017:033 Any man who makes it his object to keep his own life safe,
        will lose it; but whoever loses his life will preserve it.

017:034 On that night, I tell you, there will be two men in one bed:
        one will be taken away and the other left behind.

017:035 There will be two women turning the mill together:
        one will be taken away and the other left behind."

017:036 []

017:037 "Where, Master?" they inquired.  "Where the dead body is,"
        He replied, "there also will the vultures flock together."

018:001 He also taught them by a parable that they must always pray
        and never lose heart.

018:002 "In a certain town," He said, "there was a judge who had no
        fear of God and no respect for man.

018:003 And in the same town was a widow who repeatedly came and
        entreated him, saying, "`Give me justice and stop my oppressor.'

018:004 "For a time he would not, but afterwards he said to himself,
        "`Though I have neither reverence for God nor respect for man,

018:005 yet because she annoys me I will give her justice, to prevent
        her from constantly coming to pester me.'"

018:006 And the Lord said, "Hear those words of the unjust judge.

018:007 And will not God avenge the wrongs of His own People who cry
        aloud to Him day and night, although He seems slow in taking
        action on their behalf?

018:008 Yes, He will soon avenge their wrongs.  Yet, when the Son
        of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?"

018:009 And to some who relied on themselves as being righteous men,
        and looked down upon all others, He addressed this parable.

018:010 "Two men went up to the Temple to pray," He said; "one being
        a Pharisee and the other a tax-gatherer.

018:011 The Pharisee, standing erect, prayed as follows by himself:
        "`O God, I thank Thee that I am not like other people--
        I am not a thief nor a cheat nor an adulterer, nor do I
        even resemble this tax-gatherer.

018:012 I fast twice a week.  I pay the tithe on all my gains.'

018:013 "But the tax-gatherer, standing far back, would not so much as lift
        his eyes to Heaven, but kept beating his breast and saying,
        "`O God, be reconciled to me, sinner that I am.'

018:014 "I tell you that this man went home more thoroughly absolved
        from guilt than the other; for every one who uplifts himself
        will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be uplifted."

018:015 On one occasion people also brought with them their infants,
        for Him to touch them; but the disciples, noticing this,
        proceeded to find fault with them.

018:016 Jesus however called the infants to Him.  "Let the little
        children come to me," He said; "do not hinder them; for it
        is to those who are childlike that the Kingdom of God belongs.

018:017 I tell you in solemn truth that, whoever does not receive
        the Kingdom of God like a little child will certainly
        not enter it."

018:018 The question was put to Him by a Ruler:  "Good Rabbi,
        what shall I do to inherit the Life of the Ages?"

018:019 "Why do you call me good?" replied Jesus; "there is no one
        good but One, namely God.

018:020 You know the Commandments:  `Do not commit adultery;'
        `Do not murder;' `Do not steal;' `Do not lie in giving evidence;'
        `Honour thy father and thy mother.'"

018:021 "All of those," he replied, "I have kept from my youth."

018:022 On receiving this answer Jesus said to him, "There is still
        one thing wanting in you.  Sell everything you possess and give
        the money to the poor, and you shall have wealth in Heaven;
        and then come, follow me."

018:023 But on hearing these words he was deeply sorrowful,
        for he was exceedingly rich.

018:024 Jesus saw his sorrow, and said, "With how hard a struggle
        do the possessors of riches ever enter the Kingdom of God!

018:025 Why, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye
        than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God."

018:026 "Who then can be saved?" exclaimed the hearers.

018:027 "Things impossible with man," He replied, "are possible with God."

018:028 Then Peter said, "See, we have given up our homes and
        have followed you."

018:029 "I solemnly tell you," replied Jesus, "that there is no one
        who has left house or wife, or brothers or parents or children,
        for the sake of God's Kingdom,

018:030 who shall not certainly receive many times as much in this life,
        and in the age that is coming the Life of the Ages."

018:031 Then He drew the Twelve to Him and said, "See, we are going
        up to Jerusalem, and everything written in the Prophets
        which refers to the Son of Man will be fulfilled.

018:032 For He will be given up to the Gentiles, and be mocked,
        outraged and spit upon.

018:033 They will scourge Him and put Him to death, and on the third
        day He will rise to life again."

018:034 Nothing of this did they understand.  The words were a mystery
        to them, nor could they see what He meant.

018:035 As Jesus came near to Jericho, there was a blind man sitting
        by the way-side begging.

018:036 He heard a crowd of people going past, and inquired what
        it all meant.

018:037 "Jesus the Nazarene is passing by," they told him.

018:038 Then, at the top of his voice, he cried out, "Jesus, son of David,
        take pity on me."

018:039 Those in front reproved him and tried to silence him;
        but he continued shouting, louder than ever, "Son of David,
        take pity on me."

018:040 At length Jesus stopped and desired them to bring the man to Him;
        and when he had come close to Him He asked him,

018:041 "What shall I do for you?"  "Sir," he replied, "let me
        recover my sight."

018:042 "Recover your sight," said Jesus:  "your faith has cured you."

018:043 No sooner were the words spoken than the man regained his sight
        and followed Jesus, giving glory to God; and all the people,
        seeing it, gave praise to God.

019:001 So He entered Jericho and was passing through the town.

019:002 There was a man there called Zacchaeus, who was the local
        surveyor of taxes, and was wealthy.

019:003 He was anxious to see what sort of man Jesus was; but he could
        not because of the crowd, for he was short in stature.

019:004 So he ran on in front and climbed up a mulberry tree to see Him;
        for He was about to pass that way.

019:005 As soon as Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said
        to him, "Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for I must stay at
        your house to-day."

019:006 So he came down in haste, and welcomed Him joyfully.

019:007 When they all saw this, they began to complain with indignation.
        "He has gone in to be the guest of a notorious sinner!" they said.

019:008 Zacchaeus however stood up, and addressing the Lord said,
        "Here and now, Master, I give half my property to the poor,
        and if I have unjustly exacted money from any man, I pledge
        myself to repay to him four times the amount."

019:009 Turning towards him, Jesus replied, "To-day salvation has come
        to this house, seeing that he too is a son of Abraham.

019:010 For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that
        which was lost."

019:011 As they were listening to His words, He went on to teach them
        by a parable, because He was near to Jerusalem and they supposed
        that the Kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.

019:012 So He said to them, "A man of noble family travelled to a distant
        country to obtain the rank of king, and to return.

019:013 And he called ten of his servants and gave each of them a pound,
        instructing them to trade with the money during his absence.

019:014 "Now his countrymen hated him, and sent a deputation after him
        to say, `We are not willing that he should become our king.'

019:015 And upon his return, after he had obtained the sovereignty,
        he ordered those servants to whom he had given the money
        to be summoned before him, that he might learn their
        success in trading.

019:016 "So the first came and said, "`Sir, your pound has produced
        ten pounds more.'

019:017 "`Well done, good servant,' he replied; `because you have been
        faithful in a very small matter, be in authority over ten towns.'

019:018 "The second came, and said, "`Your pound, Sir, has produced
        five pounds.'

019:019 "So he said to this one also, "`And you, be the governor
        of five towns.'

019:020 "The next came.  "`Sir,' he said, `here is your pound,
        which I have kept wrapt up in a cloth.

019:021 For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man:
        you take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you
        did not sow.'

019:022 "`By your own words,' he replied, `I will judge you, you bad servant.
        You knew me to be a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down,
        and reaping what I did not sow:

019:023 why then did you not put my money into a bank, that when I
        came I might have received it back with interest?

019:024 "And he said to those who stood by, "`Take the pound from him
        and give it to him who has the ten pounds.'

019:025 ("They said to him, "`Sir, he already has ten pounds.')

019:026 "`I tell you that to every one who has anything, more shall
        be given; and from him who has not anything, even what he has
        shall be taken away.

019:027 But as for those enemies of mine who were unwilling that I
        should become their king, bring them here, and cut them
        to pieces in my presence.'"

019:028 After thus speaking, He journeyed onward, proceeding up to Jerusalem.

019:029 And when he was come near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount
        called the Oliveyard, He sent two of the disciples on in front,

019:030 saying to them, "Go into the village facing you.  On entering it you
        will find an ass's foal tied up which no one has ever yet ridden:
        untie it, and bring it here.

019:031 And if any one asks you, `Why are you untying the colt?'
        simply say, `The Master needs it.'"

019:032 So those who were sent went and found things as He had told them.

019:033 And while they were untying the colt the owners called out,
        "Why are you untying the colt?"

019:034 and they replied, "The Master needs it."

019:035 Then they brought it to Jesus, and after throwing their outer
        garments on the colt they placed Jesus on it.

019:036 So He rode on, while they carpeted the road with their garments.

019:037 And when He was now getting near Jerusalem, and descending
        the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began
        in their joy to praise God in loud voices for all the mighty
        deeds they had witnessed.

019:038 "Blessed is the King," they cried, "who comes in the name of
        the Lord:  in Heaven peace, and glory in the highest realms."

019:039 Thereupon some of the Pharisees in the crowd appealed to Him,
        saying, "Rabbi, reprove your disciples."

019:040 "I tell you," He replied, "that if *they* became silent,
        the very stones would cry out."

019:041 When He came into full view of the city, He wept aloud
        over it, and exclaimed,

019:042 "O that at this time thou hadst known--yes even thou--
        what makes peace possible!  But now it is hid from thine eyes.

019:043 For the time is coming upon thee when thy foes will throw up
        around thee earthworks and a wall, investing thee and hemming
        thee in on every side.

019:044 And they will dash thee to the ground and thy children within thee,
        and will not leave one stone upon another within thee;
        because thou hast not recognized the time of thy visitation."

019:045 Then Jesus entered the Temple and proceeded to drive
        out the dealers.

019:046 "It is written," He said, "`And My house shall be the House
        of Prayer,' but you have made it a robbers' cave."

019:047 And day after day He taught in the Temple, while the High Priests
        and the Scribes were devising some means of destroying Him,
        as were also the leading men of the people.

019:048 But they could not find any way of doing it, for the people
        all hung upon His lips.

020:001 On one of those days while He was teaching the people in the Temple
        and proclaiming the Good News, the High Priests came upon Him,
        and the Scribes,

020:002 together with the Elders, and they asked Him, "Tell us,
        By what authority are you doing these things?  And who is it
        that gave you this authority?"

020:003 "I also will put a question to you, "He said;

020:004 "was John's baptism of Heavenly or of human origin?"

020:005 So they debated the matter with one another.  "If we say `Heavenly,'"
        they argued, "he will say, `Why did you not believe him?'

020:006 And if we say, `human,' the people will all stone us;
        for they are thoroughly convinced that John was a Prophet."

020:007 And they answered that they did not know the origin of it.

020:008 "Nor will I tell you," said Jesus, "by what authority I
        do these things."

020:009 Then He proceeded to speak a parable to the people.
        "There was a man," He said, "who planted a vineyard, let it
        out to vine-dressers, and went abroad for a considerable time.

020:010 At vintage-time he sent a servant to the vine-dressers,
        for them to give him a share of the crop; but the vine-dressers
        beat him cruelly and sent him away empty-handed.

020:011 Then he sent a second servant; and him too they beat and ill
        treated and sent away empty-handed.

020:012 Then again he sent a third; and this one also they wounded
        and drove away.

020:013 Then the owner of the vineyard said, "`What am I to do?
        I will send my son--my dearly-loved son:  they will
        probably respect him.'

020:014 "But when the vine-dressers saw him, they discussed
        the matter with one another, and said, "`This is the heir:
        let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'

020:015 "So they turned him out of the vineyard and murdered him.
        What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

020:016 He will come and put these vine-dressers to death, and give
        the vineyard to others."  "God forbid!" exclaimed the hearers.

020:017 He looked at them and said, "What then does that mean which
        is written, "`The Stone which the builders rejected has been
        made the cornerstone'?

020:018 Every one who falls on that stone will be severely hurt,
        but on whomsoever it falls, he will be utterly crushed."

020:019 At this the Scribes and the High Priests wanted to lay hands
        on Him, then and there; only they were afraid of the people.
        For they saw that in this parable He had referred to them.

020:020 So, after impatiently watching their opportunity, they sent
        spies who were to act the part of good and honest men,
        that they might fasten on some expression of His, so as to hand
        Him over to the ruling power and the Governor's authority.

020:021 So they put a question to Him.  "Rabbi," they said,
        "we know that you say and teach what is right and that you
        make no distinctions between one man and another, but teach
        God's way truly.

020:022 Is it allowable to pay a tax to Caesar, or not?"

020:023 But He saw through their knavery and replied,

020:024 "Show me a shilling; whose likeness and inscription does
        it bear?"  "Caesar's," they said.

020:025 "Pay therefore," He replied, "what is Caesar's to Caesar--
        and what is God's to God."

020:026 There was nothing here that they could lay hold of before
        the people, and marvelling at His answer they said no more.

020:027 Next some of the Sadducees came forward (who deny that there
        is a Resurrection), and they asked Him,

020:028 "Rabbi, Moses made it a law for us that if a man's brother
        should die, leaving a wife but no children, the man shall
        marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother.

020:029 Now there were seven brothers.  The first of them took a wife
        and died childless.

020:030 The second and the third also took her;

020:031 and all seven, having done the same, left no children
        when they died.

020:032 Finally the woman also died.

020:033 The woman, then--at the Resurrection--whose wife shall she
        be? for they all seven married her."

020:034 "The men of this age," replied Jesus, "marry, and the women
        are given in marriage.

020:035 But as for those who shall have been deemed worthy to find a place
        in that other age and in the Resurrection from among the dead,
        the men do not marry and the women are not given in marriage.

020:036 For indeed they cannot die again; they are like angels,
        and are sons of God through being sons of the Resurrection.

020:037 But that the dead rise to life even Moses clearly implies
        in the passage about the Bush, where he calls the Lord `The God
        of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'

020:038 He is not a God of dead, but of living men, for to Him
        are all living."

020:039 Then some of the Scribes replied, "Rabbi, you have spoken well."

020:040 From that time, however, no one ventured to challenge Him
        with a single question.

020:041 But He asked them, "How is it they say that the Christ is
        a son of David?

020:042 Why, David himself says in the Book of Psalms, "`The Lord said
        to my Lord, Sit at My right hand

020:043 Until I have made thy foes a footstool under they feet.'

020:044 "David himself therefore calls Him Lord, and how can He
        be his son?"

020:045 Then, in the hearing of all the people, He said to the disciples,

020:046 "Beware of the Scribes, who like to walk about in long robes,
        and love to be bowed to in places of public resort and to occupy
        the best seats in the synagogues or at a dinner party;

020:047 who swallow up the property of widows and mask their wickedness
        by making long prayers.  They will be punished far more
        severely than others."

021:001 Looking up He saw the people throwing their gifts into the Treasury--
        the rich people.

021:002 He also saw a poor widow dropping in two farthings,

021:003 and He said, "In truth I tell you that this widow, so poor,
        has thrown in more than any of them.

021:004 For from what they could well spare they have all of them
        contributed to the offerings, but she in her need has thrown
        in all she had to live on."

021:005 When some were remarking about the Temple, how it was embellished
        with beautiful stones and dedicated gifts, He said,

021:006 "As to these things which you now admire, the time is coming
        when there will not be one stone left here upon another
        which will not be pulled down."

021:007 "Rabbi, when will this be?" they asked Him, "and what will be
        the token given when these things are about to take place?"

021:008 "See to it," He replied, "that you are not misled;
        for many will come assuming my name and professing,
        `I am He,' or saying, `The time is close at hand.'
        Do not go and follow them.

021:009 But when you hear of wars and turmoils, be not afraid;
        for these things must happen first, but the end does
        not come immediately."

021:010 Then He said to them, "Nation will rise in arms against nation,
        and kingdom against kingdom.

021:011 And there will be great earthquakes, and in places famines
        and pestilence; and there will be terrible sights and wonderful
        tokens from Heaven.

021:012 "But before all these things happen they will lay hands on you
        and persecute you.  They will deliver you up to synagogues
        and to prison, and you will be brought before kings and governors
        for my sake.

021:013 In the end all this will be evidence of your fidelity.

021:014 "Make up your minds, however, not to prepare a defence beforehand,

021:015 for I will give you utterance and wisdom which none of your
        opponents will be able to withstand or reply to.

021:016 You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives, friends;
        and some of you they will put to death.

021:017 You will be the objects of universal hatred because you are
        called by my name;

021:018 and yet not a hair of your heads shall perish.

021:019 By your patient endurance you will purchase your lives.

021:020 "But when you see Jerusalem with armies encamping round
        her on every side, then be certain that her overthrow is
        close at hand.

021:021 Then let those who shall be in Judaea escape to the hills;
        let those who are in the city leave it, and those who are
        in the country not enter in.

021:022 For those are the days of vengeance and of fulfilling all
        that is written.

021:023 "Alas for the women who at that time are with child or who
        have infants; for there will be great distress in the land,
        and anger towards this People.

021:024 They will fall by the sword, or be carried off into slavery
        among all the Gentiles.  And Jerusalem will be trampled
        under foot by the Gentiles, till the appointed times of
        the Gentiles have expired.

021:025 "There will be signs in sun, moon, and stars; and on earth
        anguish among the nations in their bewilderment at the roaring
        of the sea and its billows;

021:026 while men's hearts are fainting for fear, and for anxious
        expectation of what is coming on the world.  For the forces
        which control the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.

021:027 And then will they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud
        with great power and glory.

021:028 But when all this is beginning to take place, grieve no longer.
        Lift up your heads, because your deliverance is drawing near."

021:029 And He spoke a parable to them.  "See," He said, "the fig-tree
        and all the trees.

021:030 As soon as they have shot out their leaves, you know at a glance
        that summer is now near.

021:031 So also, when you see these things happening, you may be sure
        that the Kingdom of God is near.

021:032 I tell you in solemn truth that the present generation will
        certainly not pass away without all these things having
        first taken place.

021:033 Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words
        will not pass away.

021:034 "But take heed to yourselves, lest your souls be weighed down with
        self-indulgence and drunkenness or the anxieties of this life,
        and that day come upon you, suddenly, like a falling trap;

021:035 for it will come on all dwellers on the face of the whole earth.

021:036 But beware of slumbering; and every moment pray that you may
        be fully strengthened to escape from all these coming evils,
        and to take your stand in the presence of the Son of Man."

021:037 His habit at this time was to teach in the Temple by day, but to go
        out and spend the night on the Mount called the Oliveyard.

021:038 And all the people came to Him in the Temple, early in the morning,
        to listen to Him.

022:001 Meanwhile the Festival of the Unleavened Bread,
        called the Passover, was approaching,

022:002 and the High Priests and the Scribes were contriving how to
        destroy Him.  But they feared the people.

022:003 Satan, however, entered into Judas (the man called Iscariot)
        who was one of the Twelve.

022:004 He went and conferred with the High Priests and Commanders
        as to how he should deliver Him up to them.

022:005 This gave them great pleasure, and they agreed to pay him.

022:006 He accepted their offer, and then looked out for an opportunity
        to betray Him when the people were not there.

022:007 When the day of the Unleavened Bread came--the day for the Passover
        lamb to be sacrificed--

022:008 Jesus sent Peter and John with instructions.  "Go," He said,
        "and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it."

022:009 "Where shall we prepare it?" they asked.

022:010 "You will no sooner have entered the city," He replied,
        "than you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water.
        Follow him into the house to which he goes,

022:011 and say to the master of the house, "`The Rabbi asks you,
        Where is the room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'

022:012 "And he will show you a large furnished room upstairs.
        There make your preparations."

022:013 So they went and found all as He had told them; and they got
        the Passover ready.

022:014 When the time was come, and He had taken His place at table,
        and the Apostles with Him,

022:015 He said to them, "Earnestly have I longed to eat this Passover
        with you before I suffer;

022:016 for I tell you that I certainly shall not eat one again till
        its full meaning has been brought out in the Kingdom of God."

022:017 Then, having received the cup and given thanks, He said,
        "Take this and share it among yourselves;

022:018 for I tell you that from this time I will never drink the produce
        of the vine till the Kingdom of God has come."

022:019 Then, taking a Passover biscuit, He gave thanks and broke it,
        and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body which is being
        given on your behalf:  this do in remembrance of me."

022:020 He gave them the cup in like manner, when the meal was over.
        "This cup," He said, "is the new Covenant ratified by my blood
        which is to be poured out on your behalf.

022:021 Yet the hand of him who is betraying me is at the table with me.

022:022 For indeed the Son of Man goes on His way--His pre-destined way;
        yet alas for that man who is betraying Him!"

022:023 Thereupon they began to discuss with one another which of them
        it could possibly be who was about to do this.

022:024 There arose also a dispute among them which of them should be
        regarded as greatest.

022:025 But He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles are their masters,
        and those who exercise authority over them are called Benefactors.

022:026 With you it is not so; but let the greatest among you be
        as the younger, and the leader be like him who serves.

022:027 For which is the greater--he who sits at table,
        or he who waits on him?  Is it not he who sits at table?
        But my position among you is that of one who waits on others.

022:028 You however have remained with me amid my trials;

022:029 and I covenant to give you, as my Father has covenanted
        to give me, a Kingdom--

022:030 so that you shall eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom,
        and sit on thrones as judges over the twelve tribes of Israel.

022:031 "Simon, Simon, I tell you that Satan has obtained permission
        to have all of you to sift as wheat is sifted.

022:032 But *I* have prayed for *you* that your faith may not fail,
        and you, when at last you have come back to your true self,
        must strengthen your brethren."

022:033 "Master," replied Peter, "with you I am ready to go both
        to prison and to death."

022:034 "I tell you, Peter," said Jesus, "that the cock will not crow
        to-day till you have three times denied that you know me."

022:035 Then He asked them, "When I sent you out without purse
        or bag or shoes, was there anything you needed?"
        "No, nothing," they replied.

022:036 "But now," said He, "let the one who has a purse take it,
        and he who has a bag must do the same.  And let him who has
        no sword sell his outer garment and buy one.

022:037 For I tell you that those words of Scripture must yet find their
        fulfilment in me:  `And He was reckoned among the lawless';
        for indeed that saying about me has its accomplishment."

022:038 "Master, here are two swords," they exclaimed.
        "That is enough," He replied.

022:039 On going out, He proceeded as usual to the Mount of Olives,
        and His disciples followed Him.

022:040 But when He arrived at the place, He said to them, "Pray that you
        may not come into temptation."

022:041 But He Himself withdrew from them about a stone's throw,
        and knelt down and prayed repeatedly, saying,

022:042 "Father, if it be Thy will, take this cup away from me;
        yet not my will but Thine be done!"

022:043 And there appeared to Him an angel from Heaven, strengthening Him;

022:044 while He--an agony of distress having come upon Him--
        prayed all the more with intense earnestness, and His sweat
        became like clots of blood dropping on the ground.

022:045 When He rose from his prayer and came to His disciples,
        He found them sleeping for sorrow.

022:046 "Why are you sleeping?"  He said; "stand up; and pray that you
        may not come into temptation."

022:047 While He was still speaking there came a crowd with Judas,
        already mentioned as one of the Twelve, at their head.
        He went up to Jesus to kiss Him.

022:048 "Judas," said Jesus, "are you betraying the Son of Man
        with a kiss?"

022:049 Those who were about Him, seeing what was likely to happen,
        asked Him, "Master, shall we strike with the sword?"

022:050 And one of them struck a blow at the High Priest's servant
        and cut off his right ear.

022:051 "Permit me thus far," said Jesus.  And He touched the ear
        and healed it.

022:052 Then Jesus said to the High Priests and Commanders of the Temple
        and Elders, who had come to arrest Him, "Have you come out
        as if to fight with a robber, with swords and cudgels?

022:053 While day after day I was with you in the Temple, you did
        not lay hands upon me; but to you belongs this hour--
        and the power of darkness."

022:054 And they arrested Him and led Him away, and brought Him to the
        High Priest's house, while Peter followed a good way behind.

022:055 And when they had lighted a fire in the middle of the court
        and had seated themselves in a group round it, Peter was
        sitting among them,

022:056 when a maidservant saw him sitting by the fire, and, looking fixedly
        at him, she said, "This man also was with him."

022:057 But he denied it, and declared, "Woman, I do not know him."

022:058 Shortly afterwards a man saw him and said, "You, too, are one
        of them."  "No, man, I am not," said Peter.

022:059 After an interval of about an hour some one else stoutly maintained:
        "Certainly this fellow also was with him, for in fact
        he is a Galilaean."

022:060 "Man, I don't know what you mean," replied Peter.
        No sooner had he spoken than a cock crowed.

022:061 The Master turned and looked on Peter; and Peter recollected
        the Master's words, how He had said to him, "This very day,
        before the cock crows, you will disown me three times."

022:062 And he went out and wept aloud bitterly.

022:063 Meanwhile the men who held Jesus in custody repeatedly beat
        Him in cruel sport,

022:064 or blindfolded Him, and then challenged Him.  "Prove to us,"
        they said, "that you are a prophet, by telling us who it
        was that struck you."

022:065 And they said many other insulting things to Him.

022:066 As soon as it was day, the whole body of the Elders,
        both High Priests and Scribes, assembled.  Then He was brought
        into their Sanhedrin, and they asked Him,

022:067 "Are you the Christ?  Tell us."  "If I tell you," He replied,
        "you will certainly not believe;

022:068 and if I ask you questions, you will certainly not answer.

022:069 But from this time forward the Son of Man will be seated
        at the right hand of God's omnipotence."

022:070 Thereupon they cried out with one voice, "You, then, are the Son
        of God?"  "It is as you say," He answered; "I am He."

022:071 "What need have we of further evidence?" they said; "for we
        ourselves have heard it from his own lips."

023:001 Then the whole assembly rose and brought Him to Pilate,
        and began to accuse Him.

023:002 "We have found this man," they said, "an agitator among
        our nation, forbidding the payment of tribute to Caesar,
        and claiming to be himself an anointed king."

023:003 Then Pilate asked Him, "You, then, are the King of the Jews?"  "It is
        as you say," He replied.

023:004 Pilate said to the High Priests and to the crowd, "I can find
        no crime in this man."

023:005 But they violently insisted.  "He stirs up the people," they said,
        "throughout all Judaea with His teaching--even from Galilee
        (where He first started) to this city."

023:006 On hearing this, Pilate inquired, "Is this man a Galilaean?"

023:007 And learning that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction he sent
        Him to Herod, for he too was in Jerusalem at that time.

023:008 To Herod the sight of Jesus was a great gratification, for, for a
        long time, he had been wanting to see Him, because he had
        heard so much about Him.  He hoped also to see some miracle
        performed by Him.

023:009 So he put a number of questions to Him, but Jesus gave
        him no reply.

023:010 Meanwhile the High Priests and the Scribes were standing there
        and vehemently accusing Him.

023:011 Then, laughing to scorn the claims of Jesus, Herod (and his soldiers
        with him) made sport of Him, dressed Him in a gorgeous costume,
        and sent Him back to Pilate.

023:012 And on that very day Herod and Pilate became friends again,
        for they had been for some time at enmity.

023:013 Then calling together the High Priests and the Rulers and
        the people, Pilate said,

023:014 "You have brought this man to me on a charge of corrupting
        the loyalty of the people.  But, you see, I have examined him
        in your presence and have discovered in the man no ground
        for the accusations which you bring against him.

023:015 No, nor does Herod; for he has sent him back to us; and, you see,
        there is nothing he has done that deserves death.

023:016 I will therefore give him a light punishment and release him."

023:017 []

023:018 Then the whole multitude burst out into a shout.
        "Away with this man," they said, "and release Barabbas to us"

023:019 --Barabbas! who had been lodged in jail for some time
        in connexion with a riot which had occurred in the city,
        and for murder.

023:020 But Pilate once more addressed them, wishing to set Jesus free.

023:021 They, however, persistently shouted, "Crucify, crucify him!"

023:022 A third time he appealed to them:  "Why, what crime has
        the man committed?  I have discovered in him nothing that
        deserves death.  I will therefore give him a light punishment
        and release him."

023:023 But they urgently insisted, demanding with frantic outcries
        that He should be crucified; and their clamour prevailed.

023:024 So Pilate gave judgement, yielding to their demand.

023:025 The man who was lying in prison charged with riot and murder
        and for whom they clamoured he set free, but Jesus he gave
        up to be dealt with as they desired.

023:026 As soon as they led Him away, they laid hold on one Simon,
        a Cyrenaean, who was coming in from the country, and on his
        shoulders they put the cross, for him to carry it behind Jesus.

023:027 A vast crowd of the people also followed Him, and of women
        who were beating their breasts and wailing for Him.

023:028 But Jesus turned towards them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem,
        weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.

023:029 For a time is coming when they will say, `Blessed are
        the women who never bore children, and the breasts which have
        never given nourishment.'

023:030 Then will they begin to say to the mountains, `Fall on us;'
        and to the hills, `Cover us.'

023:031 For if they are doing these things in the case of the green tree,
        what will be done in that of the dry?"

023:032 They brought also two others, criminals, to put them to
        death with Him.

023:033 When they reached the place called `The Skull,' there they
        nailed Him to the cross, and the criminals also, one at His
        right hand and one at His left.

023:034 Jesus prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what
        they are doing."  And they divided His garments among them,
        drawing lots for them;

023:035 and the people stood looking on.  The Rulers, too, repeatedly uttered
        their bitter taunts.  "This fellow," they said, "saved others:
        let him save himself, if he is God's Anointed, the Chosen One."

023:036 And the soldiers also made sport of Him, coming and offering
        Him sour wine and saying,

023:037 "Are *you* the King of the Jews?  Save yourself, then!"

023:038 There was moreover a writing over His head:
        THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

023:039 Now one of the criminals who had been crucified insulted Him,
        saying, "Are not you the Christ?  Save yourself and us."

023:040 But the other, answering, reproved him.  "Do you also not fear God,"
        he said, "when you are actually suffering the same punishment?

023:041 And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving due
        requital for what we have done.  But He has done nothing amiss."

023:042 And he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come in your Kingdom."

023:043 "I tell you in solemn truth," replied Jesus, "that this very day
        you shall be with me in Paradise."

023:044 It was now about noon, and a darkness came over the whole
        country till three o'clock in the afternoon.

023:045 The sun was darkened, and the curtain of the Sanctuary was torn
        down the middle,

023:046 and Jesus cried out in a loud voice, and said, "Father, to Thy
        hands I entrust my spirit."  And after uttering these words
        He yielded up His spirit.

023:047 The Captain, seeing what had happened, gave glory to God,
        saying, "Beyond question this man was innocent."

023:048 And all the crowds that had come together to this sight,
        after seeing all that had occurred, returned to the city
        beating their breasts.

023:049 But all His acquaintances, and the women who had been His
        followers after leaving Galilee, continued standing at a distance
        and looking on.

023:050 There was a member of the Council of the name of Joseph,
        a kind-hearted and upright man,

023:051 who came from the Jewish town of Arimathaea and was awaiting
        the coming of the Kingdom of God.  He had not concurred
        in the design or action of the Council,

023:052 and now he went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.

023:053 Then, taking it down, he wrapped it in a linen sheet and laid
        it in a tomb in the rock, where no one else had yet been put.

023:054 It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was near at hand.

023:055 The women--those who had come with Jesus from Galilee--
        followed close behind, and saw the tomb and how His
        body was placed.

023:056 Then they returned, and prepared spices and perfumes.
        On the Sabbath they rested in obedience to the Commandment.

024:001 And, on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came
        to the tomb bringing the spices they had prepared.

024:002 But they found the stone rolled back from the tomb,

024:003 and on entering they found that the body of the Lord Jesus
        was not there.

024:004 At this they were in great perplexity, when suddenly there
        stood by them two men whose raiment flashed like lightning.

024:005 The women were terrified; but, as they stood with their faces
        bowed to the ground, the men said to them, "Why do you search
        among the dead for Him who is living?

024:006 He is not here.  He has come back to life.  Remember how He
        spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,

024:007 when He told you that the Son of Man must be betrayed into
        the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third
        day rise again."

024:008 Then they remembered His words,

024:009 and returning from the tomb they reported all this to the Eleven
        and to all the rest.

024:010 The women were Mary of Magdala, Joanna, and Mary the mother
        of James; and they and the rest of the women related all this
        to the Apostles.

024:011 But the whole story seemed to them an idle tale; they could
        not believe the women.

024:012 Peter, however, rose and ran to the tomb.  Stooping and looking in,
        he saw nothing but the linen cloths:  so he went away to his
        own home, wondering at what had happened.

024:013 On that same day two of the disciples were walking to Emmaus,
        a village seven or eight miles from Jerusalem,

024:014 and were conversing about all these recent events;

024:015 and, in the midst of their conversation and discussion,
        Jesus Himself came and joined them,

024:016 though they were prevented from recognizing Him.

024:017 "What is the subject," He asked them, "on which you are
        talking so earnestly, as you walk?"  And they stood still,
        looking full of sorrow.

024:018 Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered, "Are you a stranger
        lodging alone in Jerusalem, that you have known nothing
        of the things that have lately happened in the city?"

024:019 "What things?"  He asked.  "The things about Jesus the Nazarene,"
        they said, "who was a Prophet powerful in work and word
        before God and all the people;

024:020 and how our High Priests and Rulers delivered Him up to be
        sentenced to death, and crucified Him.

024:021 But we were hoping that it was He who was about to ransom Israel.
        Yes, and moreover it was the day before yesterday that
        these things happened.

024:022 And, besides, some of the women of our company have amazed us.
        They went to the tomb at daybreak,

024:023 and, finding that His body was not there, they came and declared
        to us that they had also seen a vision of angels who said
        that He was alive.

024:024 Thereupon some of our party went to the tomb and found things
        just as the women had said; but Jesus Himself they did not see."

024:025 "O dull-witted men," He replied, "with minds so slow to believe
        all that the Prophets have spoken!

024:026 Was there not a necessity for the Christ thus to suffer,
        and then enter into His glory?"

024:027 And, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained
        to them the passages in Scripture which refer to Himself.

024:028 When they had come near the village to which they were going,
        He appeared to be going further.

024:029 But they pressed Him to remain with them.  "Because," said they,
        "it is getting towards evening, and the day is nearly over."
        So He went in to stay with them.

024:030 But as soon as He had sat down with them, and had taken the bread
        and had blessed and broken it, and was handing it to them,

024:031 their eyes were opened and they recognized Him.
        But He vanished from them.

024:032 "Were not our hearts," they said to one another, "burning
        within us while He talked to us on the way and explained
        the Scriptures to us?"

024:033 So they rose and without an hour's delay returned to Jerusalem,
        and found the Eleven and the rest met together, who said to them,

024:034 "Yes, it is true:  the Master has come back to life.
        He has been seen by Simon."

024:035 Then they related what had happened on the way, and how He
        had been recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.

024:036 While they were thus talking, He Himself stood in their midst
        and said, "Peace be to you!"

024:037 Startled, and in the utmost alarm, they thought they were
        looking at a spirit;

024:038 but He said to them, "Why such alarm?  And why are there
        such questionings in your minds?

024:039 See my hands and my feet--it is my very self.  Feel me and see,
        for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see I have."

024:040 And then He showed them His hands and His feet.

024:041 But, while they still could not believe it for joy and were full
        of astonishment, He asked them, "Have you any food here?"

024:042 And they gave Him a piece of roasted fish,

024:043 and He took it and ate it in their presence.

024:044 And He said to them, "This is what I told you while I
        was still with you--that everything must be fulfilled
        that is written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets
        and the Psalms concerning me."

024:045 Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,

024:046 and He said, "Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer
        and on the third day rise again from among the dead;

024:047 and that proclamation would be made, in His name,
        of repentance and forgiveness of sins to all the nations,
        beginning in Jerusalem.

024:048 You are witnesses as to these things.

024:049 And remember that I am about to send out my Father's promised
        gift to rest upon you.  But, as for you, wait patiently
        in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."

024:050 And He brought them out to within view of Bethany, and then
        lifted up His hands and blessed them.

024:051 And while He was blessing them, He parted from them and was
        carried up into Heaven.

024:052 They worshipped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.

024:053 Afterwards they were continually in attendance at the Temple,
        blessing God.

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
