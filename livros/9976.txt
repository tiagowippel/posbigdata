HERNANI

A DRAMA BY VICTOR HUGO


_EDITED WITH NOTES AND AN ESSAY ON VICTOR HUGO_

PREFACE.


The text of this edition is the same as that of the _�dition
d�finitive_, Paris, 1880. The unusual length of the introduction will
be pardoned, it is hoped, in view of the paucity of general reviews of
modern French literature that are available for students in schools
and some colleges. It contains the matter which I should require a
class of my own to get up for examination in connection with reading
this play or any other of Hugo's works. The Historical Note is a
necessity, and is introduced before the play to save students from
confusion and waste of time.

Mr. H.A. Perry and Dr. John E. Matzke, in their editions of �Hernani�,
have so thoroughly annotated it that it has been impossible to avoid
the appearance of following them very closely; and there are indeed
several notes for which I am directly indebted to them. Without their
indications, I should in other cases have been obliged to spend a
great deal more time in looking up references than has been necessary.
It would be unfair to Dr. Matzke, in particular, not to pay tribute to
the completeness of his notes, which leave his successor little chance
for originality.

VICTOR HUGO.


For American and English readers who are at all well informed about
modern European literature the name of Victor Hugo stands out more
prominently than any other as representing the intellectual life of
France since the fall of Napoleon. Even the defects of his character
are by many considered typically French. They see him excessively
conceited, absurdly patriotic, a too voluminous producer of very
varied works; and it is not unusual to find that such readers believe
him to be all the more French for these peculiarities. It would open
their eyes if they should read what M. Ferdinand Bruneti�re, the most
authoritative French critic of our generation, says of Victor Hugo.
They would be surprised, if they conversed with intelligent Frenchmen
generally, to hear their opinions of him. Indeed if they had a wider
acquaintance with French letters and French character they would not
need M. Bruneti�re or any other guide, because they would feel for
themselves that Hugo must seem to the French just as peculiar, just as
phenomenal, as he does to foreigners. For it is only to superficial
readers that French literature can appear to be in the main frivolous
or eccentric. Dignity is not necessarily severe. It cannot be heavy;
indeed, grace is of its essence. And dignity is the note of French
literature in the seventeenth century, its Augustan age. To say that
seriousness is the note of the eighteenth-century literature in France
may sound less axiomatic, but I think it is even more true. No men
are more serious than those who believe it to be their mission to
revolutionize and reform society. We may not now take Diderot and
Voltaire and Rousseau as seriously as they took themselves; but that
is partly because their purposes have been to a large extent achieved,
and the result is an old story to us. The note of the nineteenth
century in French literature is harder to catch, perhaps cannot be
caught; for the voices are many, and we are too near the stage. But
if anything is evident it is that this epoch is marked by severe and
conscientious industry. Criticism has been developed into an almost
perfect instrument for quick, sure testing of literary claims. A
perverse book may, through neglect, through its insignificance, or
indeed through its very absurdity, find a large number of gentle
readers in England or America. In France less favor would be shown
it. The artistic sense is more widely diffused there; life centres
in Paris, where values can be readily compared; and, above all, the
custom of personal journalism prevails in France. A man is not going
to waste his time in reading a new book if the critic most competent
to judge condemns it over his own signature in the morning paper.
And if a new book is so insignificant that no critic reviews it, the
condemnation of silence is even more annihilating. Then, too, the
competition for literary honors is intense. The rewards are greater
than in any other country: a seat in the Academy; a professor's chair
in the College de France; an office of dignity and pecuniary value
under government; the knowledge that a successful French book
will sell from St. Petersburg to Madrid, and from Amsterdam to
Constantinople--all over the world, in fact; for in nearly every
country people read two languages--their own and French. In this
competition it may not always be the best-written books that come to
the front; but the chance of their doing so is immensely greater than
elsewhere. And another beneficial result is the careful toil bestowed
upon the preparation of books, the training to which authors submit
themselves, the style and finish, the lopping off of eccentricities
and crudities, the infinite pains, in short, which a writer will take
when he knows that his fate depends on his pleasing first of all a
select and cultivated audience of _connoisseurs_. No journeyman work
will do.

It was by such a tribunal that Victor Hugo was judged, long before his
name was known outside of France. And yet, although the popular voice
has been immensely favorable to him for two generations, this high
court of criticism has not decided the case. The position of Victor
Hugo is by no means definitely established, as Alfred de Musset's is
established, and Balzac's. But, whatever be the verdict, Victor Hugo,
because of the power and quantity of his work, and his long life,
certainly is the most imposing figure of this century in French
literature.

It is often a questionable proceeding to make one man's life and works
interpret for us the doings of his contemporaries, to try to find in
one term the expression for a whole series of events. It is the most
convenient method, to be sure, but not on that account the most
reliable. When therefore I remembered that Victor Hugo entered into
prominence only a little after the beginning of our century, and that
although dead he yet speaks, for the definitive edition of his works
is not completed, and every year adds new volumes of posthumous books
to that enormous succession; when I perceived how convenient it would
be to make him the central and distributive figure of this whole epoch
in French literary history,--I regarded the chronological coincidence
rather as a temptation than as a help, and resolved not to yield to
the solicitations of a mere facile arrangement. For I had no great
belief in Victor Hugo's fitness to be called the representative and
interpreter of his age. I was under the influence of the prevailing
Anglo-Saxon opinion of him as an egoist, whom even the impulsions of
his mighty genius could not break loose from absorbed contemplation of
self.

Even a critic so appreciative of national differences as Lowell
expressed this opinion when he said: �In proportion as solitude
and communion with self lead the sentimentalist to exaggerate the
importance of his own personality, he comes to think that the least
event connected with it is of consequence to his fellow-men. If he
change his shirt, he would have mankind aware of it. Victor Hugo, the
greatest living representative of the class, considers it necessary to
let the world know by letter from time to time his opinions on every
conceivable subject about which it is not asked nor is of the least
value unless we concede to him an immediate inspiration.�

Let us take another of these estimates, which might well deter one
from considering Hugo as capable of representing any body of men or
any mass of life. I quote Mr. W. E. Henley, in �Views and Reviews�, a
little volume of bright and suggestive �appreciations�, as he calls
them: �All his life long he was addicted to attitude; all his
life long he was a _poseur_ of the purest water. He seems to have
considered the affectation of superiority an essential quality in art;
for just as the cock in Mrs. Poyser's Apothegm believed that the sun
got up to hear him crow, so to the poet of the �L�gende� and the
�Contemplations� it must have seemed as if the human race existed but
to consider the use he made of his oracular tongue.�

These are but two of the many expressions of disgust anybody may
encounter in reading English or American criticism of Victor Hugo. But
not discouraged by such estimates, and fortifying myself rather with
the thought of how the French themselves esteem him, I began to read
Victor Hugo again with a view of determining whether or not he
could be accepted as the unifying representative, the continuous
interpreter, of French literature since the fall of Napoleon. And as a
result I can say that, for me, this one man's life and works formulate
nearly all the phenomena of French literary history from the battle
of Waterloo down to the present day. Except comedy and the realistic
novel, be has excelled in every kind of literature which the
French have cultivated during this century. With these two notable
exceptions, he has been a champion, a precursor, what the Germans call
a _Vorfechter_, in every great literary movement.

Nothing more deplorable can be conceived than the intellectual
condition of France under the First Empire. The fine ideals of the
young republic were a laughingstock, a butt of saddest ridicule. For
there is nothing men hate so much as the thought of a pure ideal they
have once cherished and since shrunk away from; and the remembrance of
a lost opportunity to be one's true self is the bitterest of griefs;
and no reproach stings deeper than this, of a former and nobler state
of conscience which was not obeyed. Liberty was borne down under a
weight of circumstance all the more oppressive because it was
thought that the new order of things was the natural product of the
Revolution; and indeed it looked so. Literature was bidden to flourish
by the despot. He posed as a protector of the arts, and at his command
the seventeenth century was to begin again and a new Corneille, a new
Boileau, a new Moli�re, were to adorn his reign. But he who conquered
Italy could not compel unwilling Minerva, and the victor of the
Pyramids could not reanimate a dead past. The writings of the period
1800-1815, indeed the whole intellectual life of that time, its art,
its music, its literature, its philosophy, are what might have been
expected.

After the downfall of Napoleon what intellectual ideals remained in
France? With what equipment of thoughts and moral forces did she set
out at the beginning of this new epoch? With no equipment that was at
all adequate for solving the staggering problems set for her to solve.
Just think of them! She had to deal with monarchy and a state church
all over again. She had to decide between the spirit of the old r�gime
and the spirit of '89. There was a contradiction in her past, and she
had to turn her back on one or the other fascinating epoch in her
history--either on Louis Quatorze and the _grand si�cle_ with all its
glory of treasured acquirement, its shining names, its illustrious and
venerable institutions, or on the less attractive men and measures and
purposes of the Revolution; and these latter, though apparently less
worthy of proud contemplation, impressed the conscience and the
political sense as being the things fullest of life for the dawning
future. The most loyal conservative must have felt an awkward
consciousness that the things he hated would in the end prevail.

Such, then, was the intellectual condition of France in
1815--uncertainty and division and dearth of ideals and purposes,
in the face of a future full of perplexing problems. But she was
strangely hopeful. She has never been otherwise. The French are the
most elastic people in Europe, and no defeat has ever discouraged
them. And she was in love with herself as much as ever, and as fully
convinced of her right to the leading place among all nations. Indeed
it did not occur to her that she had ever surrendered that right.

What have been the principal lines of movement in French literature
since 1815? In order to answer this question we must not merely follow
the traces of political history and say that literature changed with
the government. Such a solution would be facile, but would do violence
to the facts. The matter is verv indeterminate, and the best way to
bring it into a clear arrangement is to ask ourselves who were the
influential writers of any given period and what did they stand for.
In 1815 there were three men prominent in French letters and life:
Chateaubriand, Lamartine, and Lamennais. Victor Hugo was born in 1802,
and by 1817 he had become a literary man, not by intention merely, but
by writing. He came upon the scene, therefore, when these three men
were at the height of their activity; for Chateaubriand was born in
1768, Lamartine in 1790, and Lamennais in 1782; and they, appreciating
the need of leadership in France under the newly restored monarchy,
had thrown themselves enthusiastically into the work of instructing
the people. Let us inquire who they were and what was the nature of
their activity; or, in other words, what was the first public literary
atmosphere that surrounded Victor Hugo.

Chateaubriand at the age of seventeen was a captain of cavalry under
Louis XVI. When the Revolution broke out he came to America on a
royal commission to find the northwest passage. He brought letters of
introduction to the chief personages of the new world, and was
much impressed with the simple and gracious reception given him by
Washington, and with his unpretentious mode of life. After the failure
of his geographical researches, the young officer plunged into the
forest and started alone, on foot, for the Southwest, his head full of
romantic ideas about the beauty of primitive civilization, or absence
of civilization, put there no doubt by Jean Jacques Rousseau, of whom
he was an ardent admirer and a disciple. We are told that one evening
in an Indian wigwam he discovered a torn page of an English newspaper
and read of the ravages of the Revolution and the flight and arrest
of Louis XVI. His loyalty was awakened, and after two years of
sentimental wanderings in the forests of the Mississippi valley he
returned to France and enlisted with the Royalists. They received him
with suspicion, and even after his recovery, in exile, from a severe
wound received in their cause, they refused him fellowship. He lived
in London and Belgium and the island of Jersey, composing his first
work, an �Essai sur les R�volutions�, 1797, in which his ideas,
both of politics and of religion, are still in a line with those of
Rousseau. Shortly after its publication some inward experience of the
reality of life and its dependence upon God gave him an impulsion in a
new direction, and he began his great apology for the Christian faith,
entitled �Le G�nie du Christianisme�, 1802, of which �Atala� and
�Ren� are only episodes. At this time Napoleon was re-establishing
order, and as he considered religion necessary to political security,
and was just then courting the Pope, he showered favors upon the young
author, to the latter's manifest harm, for they made him fickle
and ambitious, and turned his natural sentimentality into the most
repulsive egoism. His masterpiece was �Les Martyrs�, a sort of
Christian epic, which appeared in 1809; and thereafter he was regarded
as the leader in a conservative reaction back to Rome and back to
royalty.

Alphonse de Lamartine was a poet of greater significance, though
in his early years he stood in a secondary place, owing to
Chateaubriand's influence with the clerical and royalist party, and
indeed with all those who longed for peace and a revival of religious
faith in France. His early life was as interesting as Chateaubriand's,
and, like his, its years of transition from boyhood to active manhood
were spent in foreign lands. His poetry is characterized by a certain
softness and sweetness peculiar to itself, reminding one somewhat of
English Cowper. It is contemplative and religious; but that does not
say all, for its range is wide, and Wordsworth has demonstrated to us
what a world of thought and fancy there may be in meditative poetry.
The chief of his works are: the volume entitled �Les Meditations�,
which contains that fine poem �Le Lac�; �Les Harmonies�; �Jocelyn�;
�La Chute d'un Ange�; �Graziella�; �Voyage en Orient�, and �L'Histoire
des Girondins�. Lamartine succeeded in being a guide to his people in
so far as he attracted them by his beautiful verse to a more serious
contemplation of themselves and the world, to a renewed interest in
true religion, to an appreciation of the fact that Christianity was
still alive and capable of inspiring enthusiasm. The feeling had
prevailed in France that vital Christianity was incompatible with the
cultivation of the fine arts. Lamartine proved this to be untrue.
He failed, however, when it came to writing history or engaging in
politics, because, as Lowell long ago perceived, and as people now
generally acknowledge, Lamartine was a sentimentalist, that is, a man
who cultivated fine sentiments because they were beautiful and not
because they were right, and who performed fine actions to be seen of
men; in other words, an egoist, an artist spoiled by artificiality.
Apart, however, from all question of the intrinsic merit of his work,
his tendency was, like that of Chateaubriand, in the direction of
recognizing religion and looking back to monarchical rather than
republican France for inspiration and example.

F�licit� de Lamennais lived a life whose details belong as much to the
history of philosophy, or to ecclesiastical history, as to that of
belles-lettres. First a priest, and the most ardent Catholic in
France, he afterward turned against Rome and led a movement towards
religious independence. There are few more interesting figures,
chiefly because great religious leaders have been so rare in modern
France. At the time when Victor Hugo was beginning to write, Lamennais
was ardently engaged in an effort to establish the supremacy of Rome,
not only over private conscience, but over political institutions, and
although from his subsequent actions he is known to the world as a
liberal and a heretic, yet at that time, having published in 1817 his
�Essai sur l'Indiff�rence en Mati�re de Religion�, he was the most
jealous conservative and the most fiery churchman in France.

Thus a superficial glance has sufficed to show that the first movement
which stirred literary France after 1815 was a reaction in favor of
monarchy and Rome; that its champions were Chateaubriand, Lamartine,
and Lamennais; that its effort was mainly through poetry; that its
honor was its high political and moral purity; that its defect was its
sentimentality; that its ultimate inefficacy was due to its running
counter to the tendency of the age. Into this movement Victor Hugo
inevitably fell; by it he was for a long time carried; with it he at
first kept step bravely.

At this point let us take a glance at Victor Hugo's early life. He was
born in 1802, of respectable and educated parents. His father was an
army officer of increasing distinction under the Empire; his mother a
sympathizer with the exiled Bourbons. During Victor's early childhood
he, with his mother and brothers, moved about through Italy, following
his father's campaignings under Joseph Bonaparte; but when the boys
were old enough to attend school their mother took them to Paris,
while the father fought through a guerilla war against the brigands
headed by Fra Diavolo. After several years of tranquillity in France,
Madame Hugo and her sons were again called to follow the fortunes
of the head of the family, this time in Spain. The father won a
generalship in the French army in that conquered country, and became
majordomo of the palace at Madrid. The boys attended school in a
college for noblemen's sons, and were badly treated by the young
Spaniards, who could not forget that the French lads were the children
of one of their conquerors. But after a brief sojourn in Spain they
returned to Paris, and there the poet-life of Victor Hugo began, and
began in earnest; for during three years, at school and at home, he
composed verses of all sorts, and in 1817, in competition for a prize
offered by the National Academy, he wrote an ode which, although not
successful in the contest, brought him into public notice.

The next year he won a prize in the Floral Games of Toulouse, with a
poem which is published among his other works, and which is one of the
most remarkable productions of precocious genius known to literary
history. In 1821 he had his first taste of the bitterness of life,
and his boyhood came to an abrupt termination, in the death of his
excellent mother. On the same day he became engaged to a young girl
who had for a long time been his schoolmate and almost a member of
his own home-circle. Her parents allowed his suit, but postponed the
marriage until he should have proved himself capable of supporting a
family. He set to work with feverish ardor and undertook almost every
kind of literary production--odes, plays, novels. The first of his
successes under this new stimulus were two remarkable stories, �Bug
Jargal� and �Han d'Islande�, stories which indicate a strange and
exuberant imagination, tropical in its fervor, its singularity, its
fecundity.

But it was in 1826, by the publication of his �Odes et Ballades�, that
he laid the real corner-stone of his fame. The king, Louis XVIII,
liked the poems, for a natural reason, as we shall see, and gave their
author a pension of one thousand francs, which in those days, and
in economical France, seemed a large sum, and the young people were
permitted to marry. It will be interesting to observe what was the
character of the �Odes et Ballades�. They are almost all political
and religious, and all thoroughly conservative; all in praise of the
Bourbons, condemnatory of the Revolution; silent as to Napoleon, or
nearly so, and glowing with devotion to the Roman Catholic Church.
They remind us of what Wordsworth twenty-five years earlier wrote,
in a precisely contrary spirit, when he was influenced by the hopes
inspired by the first events of 1789, and before the subsequent
outrages changed him into a stiff British church-and-state
conservative. These early effusions of Hugo are noble pieces of
versification, and wonderful enough as the works of a very young man;
but they cannot be called poetry of a high order, nor do they even
give promise of what he was to do later, except that towards the last
we begin to find poems which bid us expect great things in the way of
style.

Two years afterward, in 1828, appeared a second volume of poems,
�Les Orientales�, a collection of dream-pictures of Eastern life, in
somewhat the same manner as the efforts of Thomas Moore which were
popular with young ladies of the last generation, but infinitely
superior to all the �Lalla Rookhs� and other impossibilities of that
little Irish dandy. The fact is that some of Hugo's most beautiful
lyrics are to be found in this collection, and certainly some of his
greatest successes in passionate, highly-colored description. He was a
man whose heart grew slowly, however, and we look in vain as yet
for poems which could teach us much about life and how to bear it
patiently or enjoy it nobly.

But we are now in the midst of the four years during which Victor Hugo
was changing his attitude towards art entirely, 1826-1830. Up to this
time he had not entered specially into the business of criticism,
had not made theories about writing, but simply written, either
celebrating his political heroes or letting his fancy wander through
distant lands, which were full of glamour because distant. He had
gathered about him a circle of interesting people; indeed he was
already the young king of nearly all the rising literary men and
women in Paris. It was natural that there should be a great deal of
discussion among them about the rules and proprieties of their art;
but Victor Hugo was still, in this matter as in every other, a
conservative.

In 1827 he surprised this little world of admirers with a drama,
�Cromwell�, in the preface to which he expounded some advanced views
in regard to dramatic writing. His opinions were debated, and all
Paris was divided into their supporters and opponents. In 1830
appeared �Hernani�, which he succeeded in having played at the Th��tre
fran�ais, in spite of the opposition of the Academy, which saw in it a
menace to good literature.

There are few exciting events in the history of literature. It is in
the main a record of quiet, intellectual lives, a story of thoughts
and tendencies. The account of a single border feud will present a
greater number of striking incidents than the history of the forces
which have produced our English poetry or Germany's philosophy.
And the few memorable anecdotes of a concrete character which are
scattered here and there in the chronicles of literature usually
attract more attention than they deserve. They are suitable chiefly
to awaken the interest of children and ignorant people. Out of ten
persons who will tell you that Demosthenes practised oratory by the
sea-shore, with a pebble in his mouth, not more than one has any
notion what his orations themselves were about. The man who is most
set agog by the story of Shakespeare's poaching exploit is the least
likely to have read his plays. The same thing might be said of the
hubbub occasioned by the first representation of Victor Hugo's
�Hernani�, on February 25, 1830. There is a temptation to make
�Hernani� the text of disquisitions on Romanticism, forgetting that it
is a drama of high intrinsic merit, and that the question of positive
value is, after all, the essential one.

Word was passed about among those who regarded Hugo's new theories
with aversion, and a large and mainly hostile audience was assembled
on that memorable night, the most eventful _premiere_ since the first
representation of Corneille's �Cid�, nearly two hundred years before.
Everybody knows what happened. Everybody knows how fashion and
aristocracy and journalism combined to kill the new piece, which was
said to have been written in defiance of the rules followed by Racine
and Voltaire; how the regular theatre-goers hissed, and were howled
at in turn by the worshippers of novelty, frowsy, long-haired young
artists and penny-a-liners and students, from the left bank of the
Seine, who had been brought over to support the play. One of the most
sacred institutions of the French theatre is the _claque_, or body of
hired applauders. Now on this occasion there was no _claque_, for
the friends of Victor Hugo had distributed free tickets in the Latin
Quarter, and their recipients were present, ready to raise the roof if
necessary. The hissing and hooting began almost with the first line,
and continued for several hours, until the actors had mouthed through
the whole tragedy; and yet it was considered that �Hernani� had won
the day.

To us such a way of supporting the fine arts and defending the canons
of literary taste, indeed even such widespread and frenzied interest
in anything except business, sport, politics, and religion, seems, to
say the least, remarkable. But we must remember that the French go to
the theatre even more than we go to church; that in February 1830 it
was not safe to get excited about politics in Paris; that athletics
were neglected in France previous to 1871; and that possibly the
French might disagree with us in our estimation of business as the
chief end of man. But although I admire the French for this fine
capability of theirs,--this capability of taking an excited interest
in the things of the mind, I cannot help thinking that the critics and
historians have made too much of that fracas on the 25th of February,
1830, in the Th��tre francais. They tell us that this was the first
great fight between the Romanticists and the Classicists.

We can learn what these words mean only by getting the critics to
indicate to us a piece of art-work constructed according to the
Romanticists and another constructed according to the Classicists, and
then comparing them and picking out the essential differences.
They say �Hernani� is a drama of the Romanticists, and that
seventeenth-century tragedy was classical. We find, indeed, that
Victor Hugo's drama differs from Racine's; �Hernani� is based upon
life in Spain, and not in Greece or Rome, and the period is the
sixteenth century, and not the age of Pericles or Tiberius Caesar.
But if this is all, then Corneille was a Romanticist, for his first
successful tragedy, the �Cid�, is also a drama of Spanish life, and
is set, moreover, in the Middle Ages. But, they say, this is not all:
�Hernani� is romantic because it contains a mingling of the comic and
the heroic, inasmuch as there are in it words and notions of common
use, where the author might have employed expressions and ideas
consecrated and set apart wholly to the service of poetry.

And this is true. Victor Hugo does use both phrases and thoughts that
no writer of French tragedy had dared to use before. And here, rather
than anywhere else, do we find what we mean when we say he was a
Romanticist. I have heard one definition of the term as applied to
French literature, which said that the essence of Classicism was the
seeking of material in the life of Greece and Rome, and that the
essence of Romanticism was the seeking of material in the life of the
Middle Ages. The true definition, I think, however, is this, if any be
possible: Classicism in literature consists in limiting the choice of
a writer within a certain range of special terms and special ideas,
these terms and these ideas being such as the best authors of the
past have considered beautiful and appropriate. Romanticism is the
theory--a more generous one--which would permit and encourage a writer
to look for his material and his terms among thoughts and expressions
more common in everyday experience, with large freedom of choice. As
a matter of fact, the poet who is no longer bound by the examples
of Racine and Voltaire will naturally turn to the Middle Ages for
inspiration and material, because Racine and Voltaire have nearly
exhausted the resources of Greece and Rome.

It would be foolish to take pride in the discovery, for so much has
been written on this subject that surely some one has expressed my
idea long ago; but I do think that the whole question of Classicism,
and the thing itself, sprang almost entirely from Racine. At any rate
they are purely French in origin. The old stupid German Classicism
which Lessing demolished, the eighteenth-century English Classicism
which Scott and Wordsworth demolished, both had their source in
France. And in France Racine ruled supreme. He built his tragedies
after a severe pattern, and made them very beautiful, but wholly
artificial. People liked them, in that stiff and conventional age,
and were far enough from investigating whether they and the dramas of
Sophocles and Seneca were in truth built on the same plan. They took
that for granted. Henceforth to their minds there was only one way
of making a tragedy: it must not violate the three unities, of time,
place, and action; it must deal exclusively with exalted, heroic, and
terrible emotions; it must contain only poetical expressions; it must
be composed in Alexandrine couplets, with certain minor points of
agreement with the versification of Racine. In short, a writer of
tragedy must think like Racine and rhyme like Racine, and, above all,
he must never under any circumstances employ a term or indicate an
action which might be called vulgar. From France the fashion spread
all over Europe. It affected Italy, even down to Alfieri, who at the
end of the last century was hampered by this spirit of obedience to
Racine. It made English literature of the eighteenth century what it
was, and kept it from being what it might have been. Her acceptance of
this theory was one of the reasons why Germany had no literature of
great account from the time of Luther and Hans Sachs to the day of
brave old Lessing, who was the first man of consequence to see what
was the matter, and to set to work remedying it by destructive
criticism and constructive example. If it is the glory of Germany that
her Lessing was the sharpest-eyed man in Europe and the first person
sound enough, independent enough, blunt enough, and skilful enough
to change the fashion; to us of English speech belongs the pride of
saying that it was back to Shakespeare's large humanity that the
reformers turned. For Shakespeare is the great Romanticist. It was in
Shakespeare that Lessing, Goethe, and Schiller, and the later German
Romanticists, whether as critics or translators or poets, studied
literary art. The Germans Tieck and Schlegel and Herder and von Arnim,
justly celebrated as students of mediaeval literature and as original
producers, were pre-eminently Shakespearean scholars. And now the
French make a great stir of self-gratulation when, as late as 1830,
one of their own poets falls into line and discovers that Shakespeare,
and not Racine, had defined the true boundaries of the tragedian's
art.

Racine tolerated no mingling of the comic and the tragic, as if
laughter never followed tears. Shakespeare constantly mingles them.
Racine would have been horrified at the thought of descending
occasionally to prose, or introducing real songs (the choruses in
�Esther� are hardly of that character) in tragedy. Shakespeare, better
acquainted with this mad, sweet, awful world of ours, is no more
afraid of sudden contrasts than Nature is herself. Racine could never
have brought himself to say �handkerchief� in a tragedy. Shakespeare
does not say that Othello demands of Desdemona a quadrangular tissue
of snowiest cambric, but comes plump out with the word, and it wrecked
Alfred de Vigny's French translation of �Othello� when it was first
performed in Paris, in 1829, and the actor uttered the unhappy word
_mouchoir_.

I do not mean to imply that Victor Hugo would not have emancipated
himself from the thraldom of Racine had he never read our Shakespeare.
He would doubtless have felt cramped, and have sought room for
expansion. He would doubtless have done what he did do, in one
respect, and that is, have turned to mediaeval and later European
history for the inspiration of novels such as �Notre Dame de Paris�,
of plays like �Hernani� and �Ruy Blas�, and of a number of his lyrics.
The Germans had already set him an example in the matter of utilizing
folklore and the mediaeval epics and mediaeval history. The brothers
Grimm, those quiet, indefatigable giants, had opened up in Germany a
wonderful mine, not only for philological research, but of poetical
inspiration. Since the days when Goethe helped himself so nobly in the
old German storehouse, drawing thence his best dramatic product,
from �G�tz von Berlichingen� to �Faust�; and Schiller even more
abundantly,--since the days of these great men no German poet except
Richard Wagner has availed himself of these riches to make a really
great art-work, such as Tennyson has done with the Arthurian romances
and William Morris with the Norse sagas.

We have seen that the conservative reaction, represented by
Chateaubriand, Lamartine, Lamennais, and Hugo, lasted from 1815 to
1830, and that the new spirit, of Romanticism, which had been working
all along, finally became dominant then. The political revolution of
1830, often called the Revolution of July, had dethroned Charles X,
and brought in, with a more liberal constitution, Louis Philippe,
a prince of the house of Orleans. This event proved to be a great
stimulus to literary activity and a guarantee of literary freedom. It
went far towards destroying the expectation of reviving a state of
society and a tone of thought modelled after seventeenth-century life.
It weakened the monarchical tendency altogether, for it divided the
hopes of conservatives and proved that the Bourbons were not the only
possible kings of France, but that many monarchists would take a king
wherever they could get him. As is usual, and not in politics merely,
but in all combinations of human effort where supremacy must be
maintained by compromise, the unsuccessful minority, the hungry
opposition, was freer from division, more single in aim, and purer in
method, than the party in power. There is sometimes no party tonic
like defeat, and nothing is so recuperative as retirement for a
season. So then after fifteen years of invigorating rest, the
republican party was more capable in 1830 than in 1815 of inspiring
the enthusiasm of men who desired well for their country. It had been
so far purified that a young poet like Hugo might be attracted towards
it as to the saving remnant of his people. His drift in the direction
of republicanism was hastened by the fact that his next two dramas,
�Marion De Lorme�, 1831, and �Le Roi s'amuse�, 1832, were kept from
being performed by ministerial order, because they displayed two
revered kings of France, Louis XIII and Francis I as the shallow,
pleasure-loving men they were.

A new era for French literature began in 1830. We are justified in
saying this, because the great names of the former decade had lost
their brilliancy, and another set of writers began to be celebrated
and to be looked upon as establishing the tone of thought. The
character of the product, too, is different. There was a larger
freedom in the choice and treatment of subjects, the literatures of
England and Germany were being studied and translated. For the first
time, also, was there in France any widespread appreciation of Dante.
The fact I wish to establish is merely that the spirit had completely
changed, and no argument beyond the evidence of our senses is
necessary.

Pursuing still our old method of investigation, if we want to know
what the new spirit was, we must first inquire who were the prominent
men that breathed it, and then possibly attempt a definition. As
Chateaubriand, Lamartine, and Lamennais set the tone in 1815, so Hugo
with his friends and others of the same free spirit did in 1830. About
this powerful, enthusiastic man and his cultivated young wife, in
their simple home, there gathered a number of literary men and women,
who were called the _cenacle_ or symposium. They, with other persons
whom their influence touched, had a common tendency, which in the case
of some was clearly enough defined to be called a common conscious
purpose. The German poet Heine was living in Paris at that time, and
we know very well what object he set before his eyes. Matthew Arnold,
in his fine essay on Heinrich Heine, quotes the great singer's own
words, and makes them the text of an illuminating criticism. They
represent exactly the sentiment of Hugo and his friends at that time.
Hear them: �I know not if I deserve that a laurel-wreath should one
day be laid on my coffin. Poetry, dearly as I have loved it, has
always been to me but a divine plaything. I have never attached any
great value to poetical fame; and I trouble myself very little whether
people praise my verses or blame them. But lay on my coffin a _sword_:
for I was a brave soldier in the war of liberation of humanity.�

If you have read any of the so-called _com�dies et proverbes_ of
Alfred de Musset, as �Fantasio� and �On ne badine pas avec l'amour�,
you must have felt how those short recitals of passion are breathed
through and through with the spirit of revolt against conventional
opinion; how high they stand above whatever is commonplace; how little
they derive their pulsating interest from what is usual and accepted.
You know how it is when you listen to an orator who employs false
methods of exciting the emotions: how he drops his voice at the end of
certain phrases; how he whines through certain cadences; how he tries
his battery of anecdotes; how he grows warm at the conclusion, and
sits down amid a hush and thrill, very likely, leaving in shallow
minds the impression that he has made an effective appeal. Yet to the
discriminating listener it is instantly apparent that he has been
merely following the conventional method, and very possibly has not
meant a word of what he said; and when a simpler, freer man gets
up and talks sensibly and calmly you see wherein the vice of
conventionality lies. It is in deceiving the performer himself and
corrupting his power to judge himself or form a critical estimate of
what he is doing. The result is that he fails to observe that he is
doing nothing original. And so he goes on feeding us with husks of
commonplace. Now, every generation demands, and would, if it were
untrammelled by convention, produce, its own interpretation of the
phenomena of life. The radicals of our fathers' time are conservatives
for us, and we ourselves, however vigorous our protest against present
oppressions, shall in our old age be considered so much detritus,
to be got rid of by the hot young builders of that day. So the
Romanticists of 1830, being soldiers in the war of liberation of
humanity, were the deadly enemies of what is commonplace, of what is
conventional; were radicals in politics, in religion, and in their
aesthetics. One of the most interesting subjects for historical
investigation is the development of aesthetic theories. And of all
periods when art theories have undergone great changes, this period of
1830 in France is one of the most interesting.

They hoped, these brilliant enthusiasts, to bring about a new French
Revolution, bloodless, of the spirit rather than of the form. Here are
their names: Lamartine (for he had gone over to the Romanticists),
Victor Hugo, Alfred de Musset, Beranger, Alfred de Vigny, Balzac,
George Sand, Alexandre Dumas, Sainte-Beuve. You perceive that although
the original revolt was against the dramatic fetters imposed by Racine
and Boileau and Voltaire, the revolution had extended over the whole
range of literature--against conventionality in criticism, in lyric
poetry, in fiction; just as the revolt of the American colonies soon
got far beyond the original grievance about the tax on tea. Their
common tendency was protest against conventionality. They went too far
under this impulse. Alfred de Musset, for instance, translated liberty
into libertinism, and marred the innocent bloom of his art by the
licentiousness of his life. Victor Hugo, the devout, God-fearing
youth, became a sentimentalist and skeptic; a poet could not do worse,
and the effect is seen in a marked diminution of creative force. He no
longer possessed his old earnestness, and thus his work of this period
fails to touch our hearts with fire. The self-consciousness of youth,
instead of melting into that ever-present recognition of the Divine
which is the true culture of a mature man, only stiffened into an
odious self-conceit, which is Victor Hugo's ugliest blemish. George
Sand advocated and practised free-love. B�ranger, the Robert Burns
of France (but not nearly so great a poet), overdid his office of
convivial songster, and one pities him and dreads the effect of his
influence. Dumas' private life was a long scandal, saved from ignominy
only by the contrast between its ludicrousness and his genius. His
lack of restraint affected his work too, for had he possessed more
restraint he would have written fewer books, and they might all have
been as good as �Les Trois Mousquetaires�.

Alfred de Vigny is a beautiful exception. Although he followed Victor
Hugo with all the ardor of his chivalrous nature, he preserved at the
same time a measure, a moderation, a grace, a consistency, which the
coldest Classicist might have envied. He was born in 1799, of a family
of soldiers, and tells us he learned war at the wounded knees of his
warrior father. In his early life he was constantly laying down the
pen for the sword. While in garrison at Paris he was to be found
chiefly in the libraries, and it was in camp, in the Pyrenees, that
he wrote his celebrated historical novel, �Cinq Mars�. I have already
mentioned his fine translation of �Othello�, which met with such
strange and undeserved disaster in 1829. He cultivated English
literature assiduously, and drew inspiration from Milton--and Ossian.
The rhapsodies of the pseudo-Ossian were causing a great stir
throughout Europe, and were eagerly read and applied by the
Romanticists as a proof of what could be done in defiance of the rules
of Boileau. Alfred de Vigny, too, like almost every novelist from that
day to this, was profoundly influenced by Walter Scott. He fortified
his position with several other plays, of which the best known is
�Chatterton�. But the works from his hand which our generation reads
most are �Cinq Mars� and his lyric poems.

Alfred de Musset was a poet of such great importance that it is
impossible to say, in a brief sketch like this, anything at all
adequate about his delicate qualities of heart and mind, his strange,
sad life, his wonderful achievements, and his growing fame. He will
live perhaps when all his contemporaries are forgotten, except Hugo.
Hugo himself has no other rival so dangerous.

Of Balzac, George Sand, and Dumas it is hardly necessary to speak in
this connection: being novelists, they have the advantage of being
read--which is not always the case with poets. The development of the
novel has been the only concerted movement of great importance in
French literature since the early days of Romanticism. From Balzac,
the father of the realists, Hugo, the extreme of idealists, learned
little. There seems to be absolutely no artistic relation between
them. George Sand and Dumas were, of course, idealists, romantic to
the last degree, and although Hugo in his novels manifestly strains
after reality, he is much more in line with them than with Balzac. But
Hugo is not a novelist at all in the sense that Balzac or George
Sand or Dumas are novelists. He has written certain prose works of
imagination, entitled �Les Mis�rables�, �Les Travailleurs de la Mer�,
�Notre Dame de Paris�, and so forth, but the matter in each case is
essentially poetical, and it seems to me that the language is neither
that of prose nor that of verse.

There remains one other member of the _c�nacle_ who is not so well
known that mention of him here would seem superfluous, and who yet
had much influence over Hugo. Sainte-Beuve (1804-1869) was one of the
greatest literary critics the world has known--perhaps the greatest.
At the age of twenty-four he published his �Tableau historique et
critique de la po�sie fran�aise et du th��tre fran�ais au seizi�me
si�cle�, a work of deep maturity, showing a marvellous grasp of fact
and a spirit of rare discrimination. Some men seem born with literary
taste. There are boys of ten who appreciate poetry better than most
educated men of forty, and can tell you the reasons, more or less
correctly, for their opinions. The end and aim of all literary
education should be to create and foster this faculty of apprehension
and discrimination. Some come by it naturally. For others it can only
be the result of large and varied reading and considerable experience
in affairs, and of a culture of the heart. To Sainte-Beuve it was
given in abundant measure at an early age, and he strengthened it by
assiduous labor. No other language can boast a body of criticism at
all comparable with his �Causeries du Lundi� and �Nouveaux Lundis�. In
English we prize jealously, as things unparalleled in our language and
precious beyond expression for their rare beauty and usefulness,
the literary criticisms of Matthew Arnold. Imagine a Matthew Arnold
without prejudices, without hobbies, without mannerisms, who should
give us a complete body of criticism covering the whole range of
English literature, not merely discussing and estimating and comparing
authors, but telling us the contents of their writings! This is
Sainte-Beuve's secret. He makes us see the man he is talking about,
he makes us know and appreciate his productions, and then, with a few
brief, luminous suggestions, leaves the whole matter to settle
itself properly in our minds. Sainte-Beuve also wrote poetry of no
inconsiderable merit, but passes this severe condemnation upon all
the poetry of himself and his friends, at this epoch, saying: �Il
est r�sult� de ce concours de talent, pendant plusieurs saisons,
une tr�s-riche po�sie lyrique, plus riche que la France n'en avait
soup�onn� jusqu'alors, mais une po�sie tr�s-in�gale et tr�s-m�l�e. La
plupart des po�tes se sont livr�s, sans contr�le et sans frein, � tous
les instincts de leur nature, et aussi � toutes les pr�tentions de
leur orgueil, ou m�me aux sottises de leur vanit�. Les d�fauts et les
qualit�s sont sortis en toute licence, et la post�rit� aura � faire le
d�part. Rien ne subsistera de complet des po�tes de ce temps.�

But Victor Hugo outlived all parties and groups and associations of
which he was a member in that early time, and his life subsequent to
the exciting days of 1830 was a steady development and contains in
itself a reflection of nearly everything that was going on in France.

We may consider him under three aspects: as dramatist, novelist, and
lyric poet. He is greatest under the last aspect. Through all his life
he expressed himself in song. Perhaps no other poet has done this so
thoroughly, so beautifully, and for so long a period. So I shall speak
of his personality and actual experiences when I come to consider his
lyric poetry, and shall first give an account of his work for the
stage and in prose fiction.

In 1827 appeared a so-called historical drama, �Cromwell�, which was
not remarkable for much except its lack of historical truth, and its
preface, in which the young man outlined his theories and laid down
the programme of attack upon the classical ideas. This attack was in
reality first made with �Hernani� in 1830. �Marion De Lorme�, which
appeared in 1831, is a much weaker play, and abounds in all the
excesses to which Romanticism was prone. Apart from the substance,
which is repulsive and harrowing, when not trivial and weak, the form
of the drama is loose, and one can very easily understand how such a
production would offend an ear trained to the stately, chaste, and
elegant dialogue of the elder poets. If this is all Romanticism has
to offer, let us have back our Corneille and Racine. �Le Roi s'amuse�
(1832) suffers from the same faults, and offends even more against
good taste. These pieces are both strong in the main, though there are
weak passages in both, but their strength is not healthy or beautiful.
Victor Hugo himself called attention to the fact that he depended for
his effect, in these two plays, upon the principle of contrast. It is
a principle which he has employed in nearly all his work, and which is
indeed one of the strongest elements of artistic effect, always and
everywhere, with all writers. Hugo, however, uses it too deliberately
and too exclusively. In �Le Roi s'amuse�, for example, he has chosen
a most repulsive figure, Triboulet, whom lie makes hideous both
externally and internally, by every device known to art, and in this
character he implants a pure flower of paternal love. Then he stands
off and says: �Behold what I have done! How deformity looks black
behind that white virtue!� The principle is useful, but he makes a
forced application of it. In his novels, too, every reader will recall
instances where a contrast has been insisted upon till one's patience
is exhausted.

�Lucr�ce Borgia� (1833) illustrates the same point. It is a piling
of horror upon horror for the sake, apparently, of bringing into
sufficient relief a few passages of great moral beauty. This is as
undignified as it is useless. Virtue needs no such setting. M. Vinet
says that in this drama Hugo pandered to the false taste of the age,
which demanded horrors and violence and sensuous appeals, instead of
leading it, as he could, to follow better principles of taste.

�Marie Tudor� (1833) is, like �Cromwell�, unhistorical. It is not one
of Hugo's greatest plays, nor is �Angelo� (1835), another drama,
in prose, founded on history; but �Ruy Blas� (1838) is generally
acknowledged to be, after �Hernani�, the best of his dramas. It was
followed, in 1843, by �Les Burgraves�, the last of his plays
written for the stage. My judgment may be too unenthusiastic, and
I acknowledge that only time can sift the true from the false, the
excellent from the second-rate; but I would not exchange the little
volume of Musset's unpretending �Com�dies et Proverbes� for all the
�Hernanis� and �Ruy Blas� in the world, and that for the simple reason
that Musset is more sincere.

We have seen that at a very early age Victor Hugo wrote two stories,
�Bug Jargal� and �Han d'Islande�. In 1831, while in the full heat of
his dramatic activity, he yet found time, by shutting himself up and
going out but once for six months, to write �Notre Dame de Paris�,
which is one of his masterpieces of prose, an historical novel built
on a scale of gigantic proportions, and presupposing exhaustive
archaeological research. It is a vast picture, full of glaring lights
and awful shadows, of Paris in the Middle Ages, with the cathedral of
Notre Dame as background, and indeed as one of the characters.

A man who had produced so many strong plays and this remarkable novel,
not to mention his lyric poetry, could not longer be refused admission
into the national galaxy of great men, and in 1841 Hugo was elected
a member of the Academy. Two years later he was created a peer of
France. In spite of these anchors to conservatism, as one would
suppose them, a title of rank and a seat among the immortals, Hugo
became more and more radical in politics, drifting gradually
towards the conception of an ideal republic, and bending his course
thitherward. When Louis Bonaparte, not content with his election to
the presidency in 1848, overthrew the government, and proclaimed
himself Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, by the infamous _coup
d'�tat_ of December 1851, there was no enemy more irreconcilable than
Victor Hugo. The brave poet was banished, and did not touch the soil
of France again till 1870, after Sedan, when the wicked Empire had
ignominiously dissolved. Although included in an amnesty, he had not
been willing to return until the Babylonian woe was past. Most of his
exile he spent on the island of Jersey, under the English flag. From
there he issued a political pamphlet, �Napol�on le Petit�, and a
succession of volumes of poetry. His second great work of fiction,
�Les Mis�rables�, appeared in 1862, followed by �Les Travailleurs de
la Mer�, in 1866, and by �Quatre-vingt-treize�, in 1874. �L'Homme qui
Rit�, 1866, was an unsuccessful attempt at an historical novel, with
the scene in England. Of his novels �Les Mis�rables� is incomparably
the best. �Les Travailleurs de la Mer�, while powerful in its unity
and intensity, is too full of technical terms and of idiosyncrasies
to be either easy or pleasant reading. �Notre Dame de Paris� and
�Quatre-vingt-treize� are the most popular, next to �Les Mis�rables�.
In �Les Mis�rables� Hugo employed that short, choppy style which
has come to be known as Hugoesque. To many readers it is decidedly
wearisome, though by others it is considered the acme of nervous,
terse expression.

But it is as a lyric poet, I fancy, far more than as a dramatist, a
novelist, or a political pamphleteer, that Victor Hugo will be known,

    �When time has swept both friends and foes.�

Unfortunately, foreign students of French literature are less likely
to seek acquaintance with his poems than with his plays and novels.
The peculiar character of French versification repels us. We,
accustomed to a more heavily accented line, cannot quickly sharpen our
ears to the delicate modulations we encounter there. But when once the
ear is attuned to these fainter harmonies, a wonderful revelation is
made to us in the long succession of songs that rose from the lips of
Victor Hugo; and I think it is safe to say that lie is at least the
greatest French lyric poet.

His poetry is so intimately the product of his life, that to
appreciate it we must know something more of that life, especially
the emotions and incidents connected with his home and family. His
marriage relation was one of perfect harmony, if one may judge of such
matters; and he was happy in his home. His wife was evidently the
companion of his thought. His children were two sons and a daughter.
In this daughter the poet's deepest love was centred, and her graces
are the theme of many of his loveliest songs, while her premature
death by drowning, with her young husband, in 1843, was the occasion
for that one of his lyrics which contains the fullest portion of moral
grandeur, �A Villequier�. It is the heartbroken cry of a strong man
whom the hand of God has at last led back to faith and submission
along paths of darkest sorrow. For it must be remarked that Victor
Hugo, intoxicated with success and the atmosphere of protest which he
himself had done so much to create, had for many years apparently lost
sight of his young manhood's conviction of the immanence of a God
in the lives of men. After his daughter's death it was upon his
granddaughter Jeanne that his affection took root--the same Jeanne
whom he afterwards celebrated, throughout his old age, in the poems
which are found in the volume entitled �L'Art d'�tre Grand-p�re�, and
who was the idol of the French nation. She was married a few years ago
to a son of Alphonse Daudet.

In the volumes of lyrics from 1822 to 1853, including �Odes et
Ballades�, �Les Orientales�, �Les Feuilles d'Automne�, �Les Chants du
Cr�puscule�, and �Les Voix int�rieures�, there is a marked change in
the views of the author as to religion and politics, from conservatism
to radicalism, from conviction to uncertainty and almost indifference;
and there seems to be a loss of energy when we compare the first with
the last productions, though there is a gain, of course, in technical
skill. But in all that time there was only an evolution, not a deep
moral change imposed from without, for the life of his heart was, all
those years, serene. But his exile broke this succession of tranquil
years and growing thoughts, and from 1852 to 1870, from �Les
Ch�timents� to �L'Ann�e terrible�, there runs through his volumes
a deep undertone of solicitude for the welfare of France, and more
especially of sad personal yearning to be back upon her soil. �L'Ann�e
terrible�, the year of the invasion of France, the siege of Paris, and
the Commune, brought him back. The very day that Napol�on le Petit
followed his conquerors out of French territory, Victor Hugo entered,
and proceeding to Paris, threw himself passionately into the national
defence. It may seem a strange thing to say, but this year of disaster
must have been a grand and almost a joyous one in Hugo's life. It was
the vindication of his exile, in so far as that had been voluntary. It
gave him a chance, which he embraced, of translating his heroic words
into deeds. Any true man who had for years been writing about the
glory of his country and the sacred duty of maintaining her honor must
have felt a proud and awful joy in the opportunity to talk now with
deeds and words.

The rest of his life, from 1872 to 1885, was spent in conspicuous
eminence, on a throne of popularity where he sat the autocrat of
republican France, without a rival, and with scarce an enemy. It is
true that his career as an active politician was a failure, but then
it must have been soon apparent to him that he ought never to have
entered upon it, and that he could be more useful and incomparably
more distinguished in his own work. He died in Paris, on the 22d of
May, 1885. His funeral was a demonstration which has seldom been
equalled in the world's history for solemn pomp and the proud grief of
a nation.

The question of the man's personality need not enter into our estimate
of a dramatist, a novelist, or an historian, though as a matter of
fact it does. But we can hardly consider lyric poetry merely with
reference to its intrinsic quality. Lyric poetry is generally a record
of its author's most intimate emotions; it is a sublimation of his
life: and this is peculiarly true in the case of Victor Hugo. For,
after all, his chief subject was himself. It is certainly permissible,
and we can readily understand that it is indeed almost necessary, that
a lyric poet should view the world subjectively. One can therefore
find no fault with Victor Hugo for this. But it is a marked
characteristic of his work that he cannot get outside of himself, that
he is rarely carried away by his passion for the beautiful and the
true, though this passion he did really possess. So although we cannot
blame his egoism as a fault, we must deplore it as a defect; for on
account of it alone he falls short, in the opinion of many critics, of
being a great world-poet, one of the supreme consolers and sustainers
of humanity.

There is a fine essay on Victor Hugo by Mr. Frederic W. H. Myers,
[note:In volume v of _The Nineteenth Century_.] which all students of
the poet ought to read, not only because it is a very thorough criticism
on Hugo as a lyric poet, but also because it is a masterly piece of work
altogether, and full of suggestions. Mr. Myers says: �In his moral nature
we shall find much that is strong, elevated, and tender; a true passion
for France, a true sympathy for the poor and the oppressed, a true
fondness for children. Further than this it will be hard to go; so plain
will it be that the egoism which penetrates M. Hugo's character is a bar
to all higher sublimity, and has exercised a disastrous effect on his
intellectual as well as on his moral character.

�In calling M. Hugo egoistic I am far from accusing him of vulgar
self-seeking--of an undue regard for any tangible form of personal
advantage. What I mean is that he seems never to forget himself; that
whatever truth he is pursuing, whatever scene he describes, his own
attitude in regard to it is never absent from his mind. And hence it
results that all other objects are unconsciously made secondary to the
great object of making an impression of the kind desired. From the
smallest details of style up to the most serious steps in political
conduct this preoccupation is visible. It was the same spirit which
prompted the poet to begin one of his most solemn elegiac poems with
the repeated assertion �that it should never be said that _he_ kept
silence, that _he_ did not send a sombre strophe to sit before his
children's tomb�, and which prompted the politician to resign in
a moment the trust which Paris had committed to him, because the
Assembly would not listen to him with the respect which he thought his
due.�

Mr. Myers seems too sparing of his praise for what Hugo did that is
excellent in poetry, passing without mention some of his sweetest
songs and most stirring outbursts of grandeur. His essay came as
antidote to the immoderate eulogy published just before by Mr.
Swinburne, and overdoes its promise of giving us a calmer estimate of
Hugo. Mr. Myers does not do justice to the contents of Hugo's poetry,
and he is perhaps not as susceptible of being ravished by the form as
Swinburne was. Yet there is truth in what Mr. Myers says when he tells
us that he thinks Hugo's �central distinction lies in his unique power
over the French language, greatly resembling Mr. Swinburne's power
over the English language, and manifesting itself chiefly in beauty
and inventiveness of poetical form and melody.� Mr. Edward Dowden
speaks with high praise of Hugo's successful efforts �to reform the
rhythm of French verse, to enrich its rhymes, to give mobility to the
caesura, to carry the sense beyond the couplet, to substitute definite
and picturesque words in place of the _fadeurs_ of classical mythology
and vague poetical periphrasis.� And this is indeed Hugo's chief
distinction and the chief distinction of all the Romanticists, for
their pretended searching of foreign literature and mediaeval history
brought them less poetical material than variety and vigor of poetical
form.

The two most characteristic classes of subjects of Victor Hugo's poems
are politics, in a wide sense of the word, and his own family life.
He is not a great poet of nature, though some of his sea-pictures are
very remarkable. He was prevented by his egoism from being a great
interpreter of the heart or a great preacher of divine truth. But Mr.
Myers, with much reason apparently, finds a fundamental weakness in
Hugo's early political poetry also. He tells, and proves it too, that
Hugo had not fully made up his mind, prior to his banishment, what his
political ideal was. He sang the praises of the Bourbons when they
were on the throne; but then he was a mere boy, and I have shown how
at that time he was under the potent influence of the period, which
made for conservatism. That surely is a part of his history of which
he has no reason to be ashamed, even though he soon emancipated
himself from royalist tendencies. But what is harder to understand,
for a foreigner, is how he could have become a worshipper of Napoleon
and a friend of Louis Bonaparte. It is only the French who could thus
kiss the hand that smote them, and love a tyrant because he brought
them false glory--the glory of victory in unjust wars. Patriotism of
that sort is a national vice, and the French have it in their blood.
We might suppose that when he had not only got rid of his Bourbon
blindness, but recovered from his Napoleonic fever, Victor Hugo
would at last find favor in Mr. Myers's eyes, as a republican, and a
republican who suffered eighteen years of exile for his opinions. But
no; Mr. Myers's praise is strictly qualified, and again he convinces
us that he is right: �We find the same vagueness and emptiness in M.
Hugo's praises of the Republic, and yet there is no subject on which a
political preacher in France needs to be more explicit. For under the
name of Republic are included two forms of government as dissimilar as
forms of government can be. A republic may be constructed, like the
American republic, on individualistic principles, reducing the action
of government to a minimum, and leaving every one undisturbed in the
pursuit of private well-being. Or it may be constructed on socialistic
principles�, etc. And he goes on to say that �no real instruction on
these points can be got from M. Hugo's writings or speeches.�

Mr. Myers carries his condemnation even into the sphere of
love-poetry, declaring that Hugo did not write the very best
love-poetry because his love was always a refined egoism, and that his
poetry suffers from �the want which separates patronage and desire
from chivalry and passion.�

I have purposely quoted some of the severest things I could find
in first-class criticism, because I wish to conclude with words of
praise, which will carry more weight if it is perceived that they were
not blindly penned. It is in itself a great achievement to have done
so much honest work of a high character as Hugo did. It is no small
distinction to have guided a people's hopes for eighteen years from
his island of exile. It is a noble end of a zealous life to have worn
for fifteen years the crown of such a nation's kingship. But when even
these proud honors are forgotten, children's voices will still repeat
and men's hearts still echo a hundred songs of the greatest lyric poet
of France.






HISTORICAL NOTE TO �HERNANI�.


�HERNANI� is an historical tragedy. Its real hero is that inscrutable
great man upon whom fortune bestowed first the throne of Spain and
presently the crown of the Holy Roman Empire, with the title Charles
the Fifth. Although Hugo, as a dramatist may do with perfect right,
departs in many instances from historical fact, the play demands for
its proper enjoyment some information concerning the nature of the
imperial office and the character of Charles.

An earlier and mightier Charles, king of the German conquerors of
Gaul, was by Pope Leo III, on Christmas Day, A.D. 800, crowned in the
basilica of St. Peter head of the Roman Empire, which was believed to
be still, with unimpaired authority, the same as that of Augustus.
From its connection with the Church as the temporal complement of the
spiritual reign of Christ's vicar, the Empire was thenceforth most
frequently denominated the Holy Roman Empire. Its vitality was never
greater than under Charlemagne himself. Its limits, both in the minds
of men and on the map of Europe, were at no time during the next
seven hundred years really greater than in his reign. In general the
Emperors claimed dominion over Italy, Germany, the Low Countries, and
much of what is now the Austrian Empire, Switzerland, and France,
besides the precedence over all other kings and potentates. They
desired to be considered, and by most men were considered, to be in
temporal things the counterpart of the Popes in things spiritual, and
with jurisdiction no less widespread. It was traditional that the king
chosen by the seven great princes, or electors, of Germany, should
proceed to Rome, there to be crowned Emperor by the Pope. With not a
few exceptions these honors were confined for long periods of time to
certain families. The first member of the house of Hapsburg who won
the election was Rudolf (1272-1292), founder of the present Austrian
dynasty. Another Hapsburger, Albert I, was chosen in 1298, and
another, Albert II, in 1438; since when, until the annihilation of the
Holy Roman Empire in 1806, all the Emperors, with two exceptions, have
been of that house.

None of his successors made such an impression upon the imagination
of contemporary and following generations as was produced by
the stupendous figure of Charles the Great. His reputation was
well-earned. He can be called, better than any other man, the creator
of mediaeval Europe. In his day looked upon as a Roman, the French
have adopted him as the father of their nationality, and he is the
hero of their ancient epic poetry. Yet, as Mr. Bryce declares, he was
entirely German: �No claim can be more groundless than that which the
modern French, the sons of the Latinized Kelts, set up to the Teutonic
Charles. At Rome he might assume the chlamys and the sandals (marks of
a Roman patrician), but at the head of his Frankish host he strictly
adhered to the customs of his country, and was beloved by his people
as the very ideal of their own character and habits. Of strength
and stature almost superhuman, in swimming and hunting unsurpassed,
steadfast and terrible in fight, to his friends gentle and
condescending, he was a Roman, much less a Gaul, in nothing but his
culture and his schemes of government, otherwise a Teuton. The centre
of his realm was the Rhine; his capitals Aachen and Engilenheim; his
army Frankish; his sympathies--as they are shown in the gathering of
the old hero-lays, the composition of a German grammar, the ordinance
against confining prayer to the three languages, Hebrew, Greek, and
Latin--were all for the race from which he sprang, and whose advance,
represented by the victory of Austrasia, the true Frankish fatherland,
over Neustria and Aquitaine, spread a second Germanic wave over the
conquered countries.� (Bryce: �Holy Roman Empire�, pp. 71 and 72.)

It is a long jump from the crowning of Charles the Great, in A.D. 800,
to the accession of Maximilian I, of the house of Hapsburg, in 1493.
The imperial dignity, as such, had declined. The power of Maximilian
lay in his hereditary possession of the grandduchy of Austria and
his acquisition, by marriage, of the Burgundian lands, including
Franche-Comt�, Luxemburg, Flanders, Holland, Zeeland, Brabant, and
Limburg; in other words, a territory which embraced what is now
Belgium, Dauphiny, Burgundy, and parts of Holland, of Provence, of
Languedoc, and of Savoy. Philip, son of this Maximilian, married
Joanna, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella. Ferdinand, head of the
united kingdoms of Aragon and Leon, and Isabella, Queen of Castile,
had by their marriage, in 1469, consolidated Spain into a strong
kingdom. Through their success in promoting industry and conquering
the Moors of Granada, and by the discovery of America, Spain rose to
a dominant position in European politics. Joanna became hopelessly
insane. Philip, for two years King of Castile, after the death of
Isabella in 1504, died in 1506. Charles, son of Philip and Joanna, was
born at Ghent in 1500. From his maternal grandparents he inherited
Aragon (with Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia) and Castile (with the
American colonies). He had been brought up at his father's court in
Brussels, and was not really Spanish in sympathies or culture. On
the death of his grandfather, Ferdinand the Catholic, in 1516, the
Cardinal Ximenes protected his interests until his arrival in Spain,
in 1517. The beginnings of his career as Charles I. of Spain were
weak. His mother, though shut up in a madhouse, was nominally joint
ruler with him, and his Spanish subjects took advantage of this fact
to oppose him and his Flemish favorites.

He unjustly and ungratefully degraded Ximenes, and showed little
indication of tact and small sense of responsibility. In 1519, on the
death of his grandfather Maximilian, Charles became Grand Duke of
Austria, inheriting from him also Burgundy, which had come into the
family with his grandmother, Mary of Burgundy. He immediately set up
his candidacy for election as German King. His opponents were Henry
VIII of England and Francis I of France, the latter a real and
formidable rival.

The electors were the Archbishops of Trier (Treves), Mainz, and
Cologne, the Duke of Saxony, the Count Palatine, the King of Bohemia,
and the Margrave of Brandenburg. The constitution of the electoral
body had been settled in 1356 by an instrument called the Golden
Bull, issued by the Emperor Charles IV and confirmed at the Diet of
Nuremberg: By it Frankfort was made the place of election, and the
Archbishop of Mainz convener of the college.

In June 1519 this body was convoked at Frankfort, and after hearing
the claims of Francis and Charles, offered the imperial crown to one
of their own number, the Elector of Saxony, Frederick the Wise. He
declined it in favor of Charles, who was then elected. It took nine
days for the news to travel to Barcelona, where the young man was.
Naturally elated at his success he assumed, even in his decrees as
King of Spain, the title of Majesty, which up to that time no mere
king had received; disregarded the appeals of his Spanish subjects
to remain in that country; and hastened to Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle),
where he was crowned German King in October 1520.

After ten years of political and military activity, contests with
Luther and his adherents, wars with Francis I, who laid claim to
Burgundy and Northern Italy, Charles was crowned Emperor, at Bologna,
in 1530. From then until 1555 he filled Europe with the blaze of his
achievements, reviving the almost vanished prestige of the imperial
office. In 1555 he abdicated his throne and retired to the monastery
of San Yuste, near Plasencia, where, in 1558, he died.

PREFACE DE L'AUTEUR.


L'auteur de ce drame �crivait il y a peu de semaines � propos d'un
po�te mort[1] avant l'�ge:

�...Dans ce moment de m�l�e et de tourmente litt�raire, qui faut-il
plaindre, ceux qui meurent ou ceux qui combattent? Sans doute, il est
triste de voir un po�te de vingt ans qui s'en va, une lyre qui se
brise, un avenir qui s'�vanouit; mais n'est-ce pas quelque chose aussi
que le repos? N'est-il pas permis � ceux autour desquels s'amassent
incessamment calomnies, injures, haines, jalousies, sourdes men�es,
basses trahisons; hommes loyaux auxquels on fait une guerre d�loyale;
hommes d�vou�s qui ne voudraient enfin que doter le pays d'une libert�
de plus, celle de l'art, celle de l'intelligence; hommes laborieux qui
poursuivent paisiblement leur oeuvre de conscience, en proie d'un
c�t� � de viles machinations de censure[2] et de police, en butte de
l'autre, trop souvent, � l'ingratitude des esprits m�mes pour lesquels
ils travaillent; ne leur est-il pas permis de retourner quelquefois la
t�te avec envie vers ceux qui sont tomb�s derri�re eux et qui dorment
dans le tombeau? _Invideo_, disait Luther dans le cimeti�re de Worms,
_invideo, quia qui�scunt_.

�Qu'importe toutefois? Jeunes gens, ayons bon courage! Si rude qu'on
nous veuille faire le pr�sent, l'avenir sera beau. Le romantisme, tant
de fois mal d�fini, n'est, � tout prendre, et c'est l� sa d�finition
r�elle, si l'on ne l'envisage que sous son c�t� militant, que le
_lib�ralisme_ en litt�rature. Cette v�rit� est d�j� comprise � peu
pr�s de tous les bons esprits, et le nombre en est grand; et bient�t,
car l'oeuvre est d�j� bien avanc�e, le lib�ralisme litt�raire ne sera
pas moins populaire que le lib�ralisme politique. La libert� dans
l'art, la libert� dans la soci�t�, voil� le double but auquel doivent
tendre d'un m�me pas tous les esprits cons�quents et logiques; voil�
la double banni�re qui rallie, � bien peu d'intelligences pr�s
(lesquelles s'�claireront), toute la jeunesse si forte et si patiente
d'aujourd'hui; puis, avec la jeunesse et � sa t�te, l'�lite de la
g�n�ration qui nous a pr�c�d�s, tous ces sages vieillards qui, apr�s
le premier moment de d�fiance et d'examen, ont reconnu que ce que font
leur fils est une cons�quence de ce qu'ils ont fait eux-m�mes, et que
la libert� litt�raire est fille de la libert� politique. Ce principe
est celui du si�cle, et pr�vaudra. Les _Ultras_ de tout genre,
classiques ou monarchiques, auront beau se pr�ter secours pour refaire
l'ancien r�gime de toutes pi�ces, soci�t� et litt�rature; chaque
progr�s du pays, chaque d�veloppement des intelligences, chaque pas
de la libert� fera crouler tout ce qu'ils auront �chafaud�. Et,
en d�finitive, leurs efforts de r�action auront �t� utiles. En
r�volution, tout mouvement fait avancer. La v�rit� et la libert� ont
cela d'excellent que tout ce qu'on fait pour elles et tout ce qu'on
fait contre elles les sert �galement. Or, apr�s tant de grandes choses
que nos p�res ont faites et que nous avons vues, nous voil� sortis de
la vieille forme sociale; comment ne sortirions-nous pas de la vieille
forme po�tique? A peuple nouveau, art nouveau. Tout en admirant la
litt�rature de Louis XIV, si bien adapt�e � sa monarchie, elle saura
bien avoir sa litt�rature propre et personnelle et nationale, cette
France actuelle, cette France du dix-neuvi�me si�cle, � qui Mirabeau a
fait sa libert� et Napol�on sa puissance[a].�

Qu'on pardonne � l'auteur de ce drame de se citer ici lui-m�me; ses
paroles ont si peu le don de se graver dans les esprits, qu'il aurait
souvent besoin de les rappeler. D'ailleurs, aujourd'hui, il n'est
peut-�tre point hors de propos de remettre sous les yeux des lecteurs
les deux pages qu'on vient de transcrire. Ce n'est pas que ce
drame puisse en rien m�riter le beau nom d'art nouveau, de _po�sie
nouvelle_, loin de l�; mais c'est que le principe de la libert� en
litt�rature vient de faire un pas; c'est qu'un progr�s vient de
s'accomplir, non dans l'art, ce drame est trop peu de chose, mais
dans le public; c'est que, sous ce rapport du moins, une partie des
pronostics hasard�s plus haut viennent de se r�aliser.

Il y avait p�ril, en effet, � changer ainsi brusquement d'auditoire, �
risquer sur le th��tre des tentatives confi�es jusqu'ici seulement au
papier _qui souffre tout_; le public des livres est bien diff�rent
du public des spectacles, et l'on pouvait craindre de voir le second
repousser ce que le premier avait accept�. Il n'en a rien �t�. Le
principe de la libert� litt�raire, d�j� compris par le monde qui lit
et qui m�dite, n'a pas �t� moins compl�tement adopt� par cette immense
foule, avide des pures �motions de l'art, qui inonde chaque soir
les th��tres de Paris. Cette voix haute et puissante du peuple, qui
ressemble � celle de Dieu, veut d�sormais que la po�sie ait la m�me
devise que la politique: TOL�RANCE ET LIBERT�.

Maintenant vienne le po�te! il y a un public.

Et cette libert�, le public la veut telle qu'elle doit �tre, se
conciliant avec l'ordre, dans l'�tat, avec l'art, dans la litt�rature.
La libert� a une sagesse qui lui est propre, et sans laquelle elle
n'est pas compl�te. Que les vieilles r�gles de d'Aubignac[3] meurent
avec les vieilles coutumes de Cujas[4], cela est bien; qu'� une
litt�rature de cour succ�de une litt�rature de peuple, cela est mieux
encore; mais surtout qu'une raison int�rieure se rencontre au fond de
toutes ces nouveaut�s. Que le principe de libert� fasse son affaire,
mais qu'il la fasse bien. Dans les lettres, comme dans la soci�t�,
point d'�tiquette, point d'anarchie des lois. Ni talons rouges, ni
bonnets rouges[5].

Voil� ce que veut le public, et il veut bien. Quant � nous, par
d�f�rence pour ce public qui a accueilli avec tant d'indulgence un
essai qui en m�ritait si peu, nous lui donnons ce drame aujourd'hui
tel qu'il a �t� repr�sent�. Le jour viendra peut-�tre de le publier
tel qu'il a �t� con�u par l'auteur[b], en indiquant et en discutant
les modifications que la sc�ne lui a fait subir. Ces d�tails de
critique peuvent ne pas �tre sans int�r�t ni sans enseignements,
mais ils sembleraient minutieux aujourd'hui; la libert� de l'art est
admise, la question principale est r�solue; � quoi bon s'arr�ter aux
questions secondaires? Nous y reviendrons du reste quelque jour,
et nous parlerons aussi, bien en d�tail, en la ruinant par les
raisonnements et par les faits, de cette censure dramatique qui est le
seul obstacle � la libert� du th��tre, maintenant qu'il n'y en a
plus dans le public. Nous essayerons, � nos risques et p�rils et par
d�vouement aux choses de l'art, de caract�riser les mille abus
de cette petite inquisition de l'esprit, qui a, comme l'autre
saint-office[6], ses juges secrets, ses bourreaux masqu�s, ses
tortures, ses mutilations et sa peine de mort. Nous d�chirerons, s'il
se peut, ces langes de police dont il est honteux que le th��tre soit
encore emmaillot� au dix-neuvi�me si�cle.

Aujourd'hui il ne doit y avoir place que pour la reconnaissance et les
remerciements. C'est au public que l'auteur de ce drame adresse les
siens, et du fond du coeur. Cette oeuvre, non de talent, mais de
conscience et de libert�, a �t� g�n�reusement prot�g�e contre bien des
inimiti�s par le public, parce que le public est toujours, aussi lui,
consciencieux et libre. Gr�ces lui soient donc rendues, ainsi qu'�
cette jeunesse puissante qui a port� aide et faveur � l'ouvrage d'un
jeune homme sinc�re et ind�pendant comme elle! C'est pour elle surtout
qu'il travaille, parce que ce serait une gloire bien haute que
l'applaudissement de cette �lite de jeunes hommes, intelligente,
logique, cons�quente, vraiment lib�rale en litt�rature comme en
politique, noble g�n�ration qui ne se refuse pas � ouvrir les deux
yeux � la v�rit� et � recevoir la lumi�re des deux c�t�s.

Quant � son oeuvre en elle-m�me, il n'en parlera pas. Il accepte les
critiques qui en ont �t� faites, les plus s�v�res comme les plus
bienveillantes, parce qu'on peut profiter � toutes. Il n'ose se
flatter que tout le monde ait compris du premier coup ce drame,
dont le _Romancero general_[7] est la v�ritable clef. Il prierait
volontiers les personnes que cet ouvrage a pu choquer de relire _le
Cid Don Sanche, Nicom�de_, ou plut�t tout Corneille et tout Moli�re,
ces grands et admirables po�tes[8]. Cette lecture, si pourtant elles
veulent bien faire d'abord la part de l'immense inf�riorit� de
l'auteur d'_Hernani_, les rendra peut-�tre moins s�v�res pour
certaines choses qui ont pu les blesser dans la forme ou dans le fond
de ce drame. En somme, le moment n'est peut-�tre pas encore venu de le
juger. _Hernani_ n'est jusqu'ici que la premi�re pierre d'un �difice
qui existe tout construit dans la t�te de son auteur, mais dont
l'ensemble peut seul donner quelque valeur � ce drame. Peut-�tre ne
trouvera-t-on pas mauvaise un jour la fantaisie qui lui a pris de
mettre, comme l'architecte de Bourges[9], une porte presque moresque �
sa cath�drale gothique.

En attendant, ce qu'il a fait est bien peu de chose, il le sait.
Puissent le temps et la force ne pas lui manquer pour achever son
oeuvre! Elle ne vaudra qu'autant qu'elle sera termin�e. Il n'est pas
des ces po�tes privil�gi�s qui peuvent mourir ou s'interrompre avant
d'avoir fini, sans p�ril pour leur m�moire; il n'est pas de ceux qui
restent grands, m�me sans avoir compl�t� leur ouvrage, heureux hommes
dont on peut dire ce que Virgile disait de Carthage �bauch�e:

           Pendent opera interrupta, minaeque[10]
     Murorum ingentes!

                                               9 mars 1830.


[a] _Lettre aux �diteurs des po�sies de M. Dovalle_.

[b] Ce jour, pr�dit par l'auteur, est venu. Nous donnons dans cette
�dition _Hernani_ tout entier, tel que le po�te l'avait �crit, avec
les d�veloppements de passion, les d�tails de moeurs et les saillies
de caract�res que la repr�sentation avait retranch�s. Quant � la
discussion critique que l'auteur indique, elle sortira d'elle-m�me,
pour tous les lecteurs, de la comparaison qu'ils pourront faire
entre l'Hernani tronqu� du th��tre et l'Hernani de cette �dition.
Esp�rons tout des progr�s que le public des th��tres fait chaque jour.

    Do�a Sol, mon amie,
    Dites-moi, quand la nuit vous �tes endormie,
    Calme, innocente et pure, et qu'un sommeil joyeux
    Entr'ouvre votre bouche et du doigt cl�t vos yeux,
    Un ange vous dit-il combien vous �tes douce
    Au malheureux que tout abandonne et repousse?

DO�A SOL.
    Vous avez bien tard�, seigneur! Mais dites-moi
    Si vous avez froid.

HERNANI.
    Moi! je br�le pr�s de toi!
    Ah! quand l'amour jaloux bouillonne dans nos t�tes,
    Quand notre coeur se gonfle et s'emplit de temp�tes,
    Qu'importe ce que peut un nuage des airs
    Nous jeter en passant de temp�te et d'�clairs[10]!

DO�A SOL (_lui d�faisant son manteau_).
    Allons! donnez la cape,--et l'�p�e avec elle.

HERNANI (_la main sur son �p�e_).
    Non. C'est mon autre amie, innocente et fid�le.
    --Do�a Sol, le vieux duc, votre futur �poux,
    Votre oncle, est donc absent?

DO�A SOL.
    Oui, cette heure est � nous.

HERNANI.
    Cette heure! Et voil� tout. Pour nous, plus rien qu'une heure!
    Apr�s, qu'importe? il faut qu'on oublie ou qu'on meure.
    Ange! une heure avec vous! une heure, en v�rit�,
    A qui voudrait la vie, et puis l'�ternit�!

DO�A SOL.
    Hernani!

HERNANI (_am�rement_).
    Que je suis heureux que le duc sorte!
    Comme un larron qui tremble et qui force une porte;
    Vite, j'entre, et vous vois, et d�robe au vieillard
    Une heure de vos chants et de votre regard;
    Et je suis bien heureux, et sans doute on m'envie
    De lui voler une heure, et lui me prend ma vie!

DO�A SOL.
    Calmez-vous.

_Remettant le manteau � la du�gne_.
    Josefa, fais s�cher le manteau.

_Josefa sort. Elle s'assied et fait signe � Hernani de venir pr�s
d'elle_.
    Venez l�.

HERNANI (_sans l'entendre_).
    Donc le duc est absent du ch�teau?

DO�A SOL (_souriant_).
    Comme vous �tes grand!

HERNANI.
    Il est absent.

DO�A SOL.
    Ch�re �me,
    Ne pensons plus au duc.

HERNANI.
    Ah! pensons-y, madame!
    Ce vieillard! il vous aime, il va vous �pouser!
    Quoi donc! vous prit-il pas l'autre jour un baiser?
    N'y plus penser!

DO�A SOL (_riant_).
    C'est l� ce qui vous d�sesp�re!
    Un baiser d'oncle! au front! presque un baiser de p�re!

HERNANI.
    Non. Un baiser d'amant, de mari, de jaloux.
    Ah! vous serez � lui, madame! Y pensez-vous?
    O l'insens� vieillard, qui, la t�te inclin�e,
    Pour achever sa route et finir sa journ�e,
    A besoin d'une femme, et va, spectre glac�,
    Prendre une jeune fille! � vieillard insens�!
    Pendant que d'une main il s'attache � la v�tre,
    Ne voit-il pas la mort qui l'�pouse de l'autre?
    Il vient dans nos amours se jeter sans frayeur!
    Vieillard, va-t'en donner mesure au fossoyeur!
    --Qui fait ce mariage? On vous force, j'esp�re!

DO�A SOL.
    Le roi, dit-on, le veut.

HERNANI.
    Le roi! le roi! Mon p�re
    Est mort sur l'�chafaud[11], condamn� par le sien.
    Or, quoiqu'on ait vieilli depuis ce fait ancien,
    Pour l'ombre du feu roi, pour son fils, pour sa veuve,
    Pour tous les siens, ma haine est encor toute neuve!
    Lui, mort, ne compte plus. Et, tout enfant, je fis
    Le serment de venger mon p�re sur son fils.
    Je te cherchais partout, Carlos, roi des Castilles!
    Car la haine est vivace entre nos deux familles.
    Les p�res ont lutt� sans piti�, sans remords,
    Trente ans! Or, c'est en vain que les p�res sont morts.
    Leur haine vit. Pour eux la paix n'est point venue,
    Car les fils sont debout, et le duel continue.
    Ah! c'est donc toi qui veux cet ex�crable hymen!
    Tant mieux. Je te cherchais, tu viens dans mon chemin!

DO�A SOL.
    Vous m'effrayez.

HERNANI.
    Charg� d'un mandat d'anath�me,
    Il faut que j'en arrive � m'effrayer moi-m�me[12]!
    �coutez. L'homme auquel, jeune, on vous destina,
    Ruy de Silva, votre oncle, est duc de Pastra�a,
    Riche-homme[13] d'Aragon, comte et grand de Castille[14].
    A d�faut de jeunesse, il peut, � jeune fille,
    Vous apporter tant d'or, de bijoux, de joyaux,
    Que votre front reluise entre des fronts royaux,
    Et pour le rang, l'orgueil, la gloire et la richesse,
    Mainte reine peut-�tre env�ra[15] sa duchesse.
    Voil� donc ce qu'il est. Moi, je suis pauvre, et n'eus
    Tout enfant, que les bois o� je fuyais pieds nus.
    Peut-�tre aurais-je aussi[16] quelque blason illustre
    Qu'une rouille de sang � cette heure d�lustre;
    Peut-�tre ai-je des droits, dans l'ombre ensevelis,
    Qu'un drap d'�chafaud noir cache encor sous ses plis,
    Et qui, si mon attente un jour n'est pas tromp�e,
    Pourront de ce fourreau sortir avec l'�p�e.
    En attendant, je n'ai re�u du ciel jaloux
    Que l'air, le jour et l'eau, la dot qu'il donne � tous.
    Or du duc ou de moi souffrez qu'on vous d�livre.
    Il faut choisir des deux, l'�pouser, ou me suivre.

DO�A SOL.
    Je vous suivrai.

HERNANI.
    Parmi mes rudes compagnons?
    Proscrits dont le bourreau sait d'avance les noms.
    Gens dont jamais le fer ni le coeur ne s'�mousse,
    Ayant tous quelque sang � venger qui les pousse?
    Vous viendrez commander ma bande, comme on dit[17]?
    Car, vous ne savez pas, moi, je suis un bandit!
    Quand tout me poursuivait dans toutes les Espagnes[18],
    Seule, dans ses for�ts, dans ses hautes montagnes,
    Dans ses rocs o� l'on n'est que de l'aigle aper�u,
    La vieille Catalogne[19] en m�re m'a re�u.
    Parmi ses montagnards, libres, pauvres, et graves,
    Je grandis, et demain trois mille de ses braves,
    Si ma voix dans leurs monts fait r�sonner ce cor,
    Viendront... Vous frissonnez. R�fl�chissez encor.
    Me suivre dans les bois, dans les monts, sur les gr�ves,
    Chez des hommes pareils aux d�mons de vos r�ves,
    Soup�onner tout, les yeux, les voix, les pas, le bruit,
    Dormir sur l'herbe, boire au torrent, et la nuit
    Entendre, en allaitant quelque enfant qui s'�veille,
    Les balles des mousquets siffler � votre oreille.
    �tre errante avec moi, proscrite, et, s'il le faut,
    Me suivre o� je suivrai mon p�re,--� l'�chafaud.

DO�A SOL.
    Je vous suivrai.

HERNANI.
    Le duc est riche, grand, prosp�re.
    Le duc n'a pas de tache au vieux nom de son p�re.
    Le duc peut tout. Le duc vous offre avec sa main
    Tr�sors, titres, bonheur...

DO�A SOL.
    Nous partirons demain.
    Hernani, n'allez pas sur mon audace �trange
    Me bl�mer. Etes-vous mon d�mon ou mon ange?
    Je ne sais, mais je suis votre esclave. �coutez.
    Allez o� vous voudrez, j'irai. Restez, partez,
    Je suis � vous. Pourquoi fais-je ainsi? je l'ignore.
    J'ai besoin de vous voir et de vous voir encore
    Et de vous voir toujours. Quand le bruit de vos pas
    S'efface, alors je crois que mon coeur ne bat pas,
    Vous me manquez, je suis absente de moi-m�me;
    Mais d�s qu'enfin ce pas que j'attends et que j'aime
    Vient frapper mon oreille, alors il me souvient[20]
    Que je vis, et je sens mon �me qui revient!

HERNANI (_la serrant dans ses bras_).
    Ange!

DO�A SOL.
    A minuit. Demain. Amenez votre escorte,
    Sous ma fen�tre. Allez, je serai brave et forte.
    Vous frapperez trois coups.

HERNANI.
    Savez-vous qui je suis,
    Maintenant?

DO�A SOL.
    Monseigneur, qu'importe! Je vous suis.

HERNANI.
    Non, puisque vous voulez me suivre, faible femme,
    Il faut que vous sachiez quel nom, quel rang, quelle �me
    Quel destin est cach� dans le p�tre Hernani.
    Vous vouliez d'un brigand, voulez-vous d'un banni?

DON CARLOS (_ouvrant avec fracas la porte de l'armoire_).
    Quand aurez-vous fini de conter votre histoire?
    Croyez-vous donc qu'on soit � l'aise en cette armoire?

_Hernani recule �tonn�. Do�a Sol pousse un cri et se r�fugie dans
ses bras, en fixant sur don Carlos des yeux effar�s_.

HERNANI (_la main sur la garde de son �p�e_).
    Quel est cet homme?

DO�A SOL.
    O ciel! Au secours!

HERNANI.
    Taisez-vous,
    Do�a Sol! vous donnez l'�veil aux yeux jaloux.
    Quand je suis pr�s de vous, veuillez, quoi qu'il advienne[21],
    Ne r�clamer jamais d'autre aide que la mienne.

_A don Carlos_.
    Que faisiez-vous l�?

DON CARLOS.
    Moi? mais, � ce qu'il para�t[22],
    je ne chevauchais pas � travers la for�t.

HERNANI.
    Qui raille apr�s l'affront s'expose � faire rire
    Aussi son h�ritier.

DON CARLOS.
    Chacun son tour!--Messire,
    Parlons franc. Vous aimez madame et ses yeux noirs,
    Vous y venez mirer les v�tres tous les soirs,
    C'est fort bien. J'aime aussi madame, et veux conna�tre[23]
    Qui j'ai vu tant de fois entrer par la fen�tre,
    Tandis que je restais � la porte.

HERNANI.
    En honneur,
    Je vous ferai sortir par o� j'entre, seigneur.

DON CARLOS.
    Nous verrons. J'offre donc mon amour � madame[24].
    Partageons. Voulez-vous? J'ai vu dans sa belle �me
    Tant d'amour, de bont�, de tendres sentiments,
    Que madame � coup s�r en a pour deux amants.
    Or, ce soir, voulant mettre � fin mon entreprise,
    Pris, je pense, pour vous, j'entre ici par surprise,
    Je me cache, j'�coute, � ne vous celer rien;
    Mais j'entendais tr�s mal et j'�touffais tr�s bien.
    Et puis, je chiffonnais ma veste � la fran�aise[25].
    Ma foi, je sors!

HERNANI.
    Ma dague aussi n'est pas � l'aise
    Et veut sortir.

DON CARLOS (_le saluant_).
    Monsieur, c'est comme il vous plaira.

HERNANI (_tirant son �p�e_).
    En garde!

_Don Carlos tire son �p�e_.

DO�A SOL (_se jetant entre eux_).
    Hernani! ciel!

DON CARLOS.
    Calmez-vous, se�ora.

HERNANI (_� don Carlos_).
    Dites-moi votre nom.

DON CARLOS.
    H�! dites-moi le v�tre!

HERNANI.
    Je le garde, secret et fatal, pour un autre
    Qui doit un jour sentir, sous mon genou vainqueur,
    Mon nom � son oreille, et ma dague � son coeur!

DON CARLOS.
    Alors, quel est le nom de l'autre?

HERNANI.
    Que t'importe?
    En garde! d�fends-toi!

_Ils croisent leurs �p�es. Do�a Sol tombe tremblante sur un fauteuil.
On entend des coups � la porte_.

DO�A SOL (_se levant avec effroi_).
    Ciel! on frappe � la porte!

_Les champions s'arr�tent. Entre Josefa par la petite porte et tout
effar�e_.

HERNANI (_� Josefa_).
    Qui frappe ainsi?

DO�A JOSEFA (� do�a Sol).
    Madame! un coup inattendu!
    C'est le duc qui revient!

DO�A SOL (_joignant les mains_).
    Le duc! tout est perdu!
    Malheureuse!

DO�A JOSEFA (_jetant les yeux autour d'elle_).
    J�sus! l'inconnu! des �p�es!
    On se battait! Voil� de belles �quip�es[26]!

_Les deux combattants remettent leurs �p�es dans le fourreau. Don
Carlos s'enveloppe dans son manteau et rabat son chapeau sur ses
yeux. On frappe_.

HERNANI.
    Que faire?

_On frappe_.

UNE VOIX (_au dehors_).
    Do�a Sol, ouvrez-moi!

_Do�a Josefa fait un pas vers la porte. Hernani l'arr�te_.

HERNANI.
    N'ouvrez-pas!

DO�A JOSEFA (_tirant son chapelet_).
    Saint Jacques monseigneur[27]! tirez-nous de ce pas!

_On frappe de nouveau_.

HERNANI (_montrant l'armoire � Don Carlos_).
    Cachons-nous.

DON CARLOS.
    Dans l'armoire?

HERNANI (_montrant la porte_).
    Entrez-y. Je m'en charge.
    Nous y tiendrons tous deux.

DON CARLOS.
    Grand merci, c'est trop large!

HERNANI (_montrant la petite porte_).
    Fuyons par l�.

DON CARLOS.
    Bonsoir. Pour moi, je reste ici.

HERNANI.
    Ah! t�te et sang[28]! monsieur, vous me pa�rez ceci!

_A do�a Sol_.
    Si je barricadais l'entr�e?

DON CARLOS (_� Josefa_).
    Ouvrez la porte.

HERNANI.
    Que dit-il?

DON CARLOS (_� Josefa interdite_).
    Ouvrez donc, vous dis-je!

_On frappe toujours. Do�a Josefa va ouvrir en tremblant_.

DO�A SOL.
    Je suis morte!




SC�NE III.

LES MEMES. DON RUY GOMEZ DE SILVA, _barbe et cheveux blancs; en noir._
VALETS _avec des flambeaux_.


DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Des hommes chez ma ni�ce � cette heure de nuit!
    Venez tous! cela vaut la lumi�re et le bruit.

_A do�a Sol_.
    Par saint Jean d'Avila, je crois que, sur mon �me,
    Nous sommes trois chez vous! C'est trop de deux[29], madame.

_Aux deux jeunes gens_.
    Mes jeunes cavaliers, que faites-vous c�ans?
    Quand nous avions le Cid[30] et Bernard[31], ces g�ants
    De l'Espagne et du monde allaient par les Castilles
    Honorant les vieillards et prot�geant les filles.
    C'�taient des hommes forts et qui trouvaient moins lourds
    Leur fer et leur acier que vous votre velours.
    Ces hommes-l� portaient respect aux barbes grises,
    Faisaient agenouiller leur amour aux �glises[32],
    Ne trahissaient personne, et donnaient pour raison
    Qu'ils avaient � garder l'honneur de leur maison.
    S'ils voulaient une femme, ils la prenaient sans tache,
    En plein jour, devant tous, et l'�p�e, ou la hache,
    Ou la lance � la main.--Et quant � ces f�lons
    Qui, le soir, et les yeux tourn�s vers leurs talons,
    Ne fiant qu'� la nuit leurs manoeuvres inf�mes,
    Par derri�re aux maris volent l'honneur des femmes,
    J'affirme que le Cid, cet a�eul de nous tous,
    Les e�t tenus pour vils et fait mettre � genoux,
    Et qu'il e�t, d�gradant leur noblesse usurp�e,
    Soufflet� leur blason du plat de son �p�e!
    Voil� ce que feraient, j'y songe avec ennui,
    Les hommes d'autrefois aux hommes d'aujourd'hui.
    --Qu'�tes-vous venus faire ici? C'est donc � dire
    Que je ne suis qu'un vieux dont les jeunes vont rire?
    On va rire de moi, soldat de Zamora[33]?
    Et quand je passerai, t�te blanche, on rira?
    Ce n'est pas vous, du moins, qui rirez!

HERNANI.
    Duc...

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Silence!
    Quoi! vous avez l'�p�e, et la dague, et la lance,
    La chasse, les festins, les meutes, les faucons,
    Les chansons � chanter le soir sous les balcons,
    Les plumes au chapeau, les casaques de soie,
    Les bals, les carrousels[34], la jeunesse, la joie,
    Enfants, l'ennui vous gagne! A toux prix, au hasard,
    Il vous faut un hochet. Vous prenez un vieillard.
    Ah! vous l'avez bris�, le hochet! mais Dieu fasse
    Qu'il vous puisse en �clats rejaillir � la face!
    Suivez-moi!

HERNANI.
    Seigneur duc...

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Suivez-moi! suivez-moi!
    Messieurs, avons-nous fait cela pour rire? Quoi!
    Un tr�sor est chez moi. C'est l'honneur d'une fille,
    D'une femme, l'honneur de toute une famille,
    Cette fille, je l'aime, elle est ma ni�ce, et doit
    Bient�t changer sa bague � l'anneau de mon doigt,
    Je la crois chaste et pure et sacr�e � tout homme,
    Or il faut que[35] je sorte une heure, et moi qu'on nomme
    Ruy Gomez de Silva, je ne puis l'essayer
    Sans qu'un larron d'honneur se glisse � mon foyer!
    Arri�re! lavez donc vos mains, hommes sans �mes,
    Car, rien qu'en y touchant, vous nous tachez nos femmes,
    Non. C'est bien. Poursuivez. Ai-je autre chose encor?

_Il arrache son collier_.
    Tenez, foulez aux pieds, foulez ma toison d'or[36]!

_Il jette son chapeau_.
    Arrachez mes cheveux, faites-en chose vile!
    Et vous pourrez demain vous vanter par la ville
    Que jamais d�bauch�s, dans leurs jeux insolents,
    N'ont sur plus noble front souill� cheveux plus blancs.

DO�A SOL.
    Monseigneur...

DON RUY GOMEZ (_� ses valets_).
    �cuyers! �cuyers! � mon aide!
    Ma hache, mon poignard, ma dague de Tol�de!

_Aux deux jeunes gens_.
    Et suivez-moi tous deux!

DON CARLOS (_faisant un pas_).
    Duc, ce n'est pas d'abord
    De cela qu'il s'agit. Il s'agit de la mort
    De Maximilien, empereur d'Allemagne.

_Il jette son manteau, et d�couvre son visage cach� par son chapeau_.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Raillez-vous?...--Dieu! le roi!

DO�A SOL.
    Le roi!

HERNANI (_dont les yeux s'allument_).
    Le roi d'Espagne!

DON CARLOS (_gravement_).
    Oui, Carlos.--Seigneur duc, es-tu donc insens�?
    Mon a�eul l'empereur est mort. Je ne le sai
    Que de ce soir. Je viens, tout en h�te, et moi-m�me,
    Dire la chose, � toi, f�al[37] sujet que j'aime,
    Te demander conseil, incognito, la nuit,
    Et l'affaire est bien simple, et voil� bien du bruit!

_Don Ruy Gomez renvoie ses gens d'un signe. Il s'approche de don
Carlos que do�a Sol examine avec crainte et surprise, et sur lequel
Hernani demeur� dans un coin fixe des yeux �tincelants_.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Mais pourquoi tarder tant � m'ouvrir cette porte?

DON CARLOS.
    Belle raison! tu viens avec toute une escorte!
    Quand un secret d'�tat m'am�ne en ton palais[38],
    Duc, est-ce pour l'aller dire[39] � tous tes valets!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Altesse, pardonnez! l'apparence...

DON CARLOS.
    Bon p�re,
    Je t'ai fait gouverneur du ch�teau de Figu�re[40],
    Mais qui dois-je � pr�sent faire ton gouverneur?

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Pardonnez...

DON CARLOS.
    Il suffit. N'en parlons plus, seigneur.
    Donc l'empereur est mort[41].

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    L'a�eul de votre altesse
    Est mort?

DON CARLOS.
    Duc, tu m'en vois p�n�tr� de tristesse.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Qui lui succ�de?

DON CARLOS.
    Un duc de Saxe est sur les rangs.
    Fran�ois premier, de France, est un des concurrents.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    O� vont se rassembler les �lecteurs d'empire?

DON CARLOS.
    Ils ont choisi, je crois, Aix-la-Chapelle[42], ou Spire[43],
    Ou Francfort[44].

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Notre roi, dont Dieu garde les jours,
    N'a-t-il pens� jamais � l'empire?

DON CARLOS.
    Toujours.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    C'est � vous qu'il revient.

DON CARLOS.
    Je le sais.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Votre p�re
    Fut archiduc d'Autriche, et l'empire, j'esp�re,
    Aura ceci pr�sent[45], que c'�tait votre a�eul,
    Celui qui vient de choir de la pourpre au linceul.

DON CARLOS.
    Et puis, on est bourgeois de Gand[46].

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Dans mon jeune �ge
    Je le vis, votre a�eul. H�las! seul je surnage
    D'un si�cle tout entier. Tout est mort � pr�sent.
    C'�tait un empereur magnifique et puissant.

DON CARLOS.
    Rome est pour moi[47].

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Vaillant, ferme, point tyrannique,
    Cette t�te allait bien au vieux corps germanique[48]!

_Il s'incline sur les mains du roi et les baise_.
    Que je vous plains!	Si jeune, en un tel deuil plong�!

DON CARLOS.
    Le pape veut ravoir la Sicile[49], que j'ai,
    Un empereur ne peut poss�der la Sicile,
    Il me fait empereur, alors, en fils docile,
    Je lui rends Naple. Ayons l'aigle[50], et puis nous verrons
    Si je lui laisserai rogner les ailerons!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Qu'avec joie il verrait[51], ce v�t�ran du tr�ne,
    Votre front d�j� large aller � sa couronne!
    Ah! seigneur, avec vous nous le pleurerons bien,
    Cet empereur tr�s grand, tr�s bon et tr�s chr�tien!

DON CARLOS.
    Le saint-p�re est adroit.--Qu'est-ce que la Sicile?
    C'est une �le qui pend � mon royaume, une �le,
    Une pi�ce, un haillon, qui, tout d�chiquet�,
    Tient � peine � l'Espagne et qui tra�ne � c�t�.
    --Que ferez-vous, mon fils[52], de cette �le bossue
    Au monde imp�rial au bout d'un fil cousue?
    Votre empire est mal fait; vite, venez ici,
    Des ciseaux! et coupons!--Tr�s saint-p�re, merci!
    Car de ces pi�ces-l�, si j'ai bonne fortune,
    Je compte au saint-empire en recoudre plus d'une,
    Et, si quelques lambeaux m'en �taient arrach�s,
    Rapi�cer mes �tats d'�les et de duch�s!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Consolez-vous[53]! il est un empire des justes
    O� l'on revoit les morts plus saints et plus augustes!

DON CARLOS.
    Ce roi Fran�ois premier, c'est un ambitieux!
    Le vieil empereur mort, vite il fait les doux yeux
    A l'empire! A-t-il pas sa France tr�s chr�tienne[54]?
    Ah! la part est pourtant belle, et vaut qu'on s'y tienne[55]!
    L'empereur mon a�eul disait au roi Louis[56]:
    --Si j'�tais Dieu le P�re, et si j'avais deux fils,
    Je ferais l'a�n� Dieu, le second roi de France.

_Au duc_.
    Crois-tu que Fran�ois puisse avoir quelque esp�rance?

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    C'est un victorieux[57].

DON CARLOS.
    Il faudrait tout changer[58].
    La bulle d'or[59] d�fend d'�lire un �tranger.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    A ce compte, seigneur, vous �tes roi d'Espagne[60]!

DON CARLOS.
    Je suis bourgeois de Gand[61].

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    La derni�re campagne
    A fait monter bien haut le roi Fran�ois premier.

DON CARLOS.
    L'aigle qui va peut-�tre �clore � mon cimier
    Peut aussi d�ployer ses ailes.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Votre altesse
    Sait-elle le latin?

DON CARLOS.
    Mal.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Tant pis. La noblesse
    D'Allemagne aime fort qu'on lui parle latin.

DON CARLOS.
    Ils se contenteront d'un espagnol hautain;
    Car il importe peu, croyez-en le roi Charle,
    Quand la voix parle haut, quelle langue elle parle.
    --Je vais en Flandre. Il faut que ton roi, cher Silva,
    Te revienne empereur. Le roi de France va
    Tout remuer. Je veux le gagner de vitesse.
    Je partirai sous peu.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Vous nous quittez, altesse,
    Sans purger l'Aragon de ces nouveaux bandits
    Qui partout dans nos monts l�vent leurs fronts hardis?

DON CARLOS.
    J'ordonne au duc d'Arcos d'exterminer la bande.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Donnez-vous aussi l'ordre au chef qui la commande
    De se laisser faire?

DON CARLOS.
    Eh! quel est ce chef? son nom?

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Je l'ignore. On le dit un rude compagnon[62].

DON CARLOS.
    Bah! je sais que pour l'heure il se cache en Galice[63],
    Et j'en aurai raison[64] avec quelque milice.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    De faux avis alors le disaient pr�s d'ici.

DON CARLOS.
    Faux avis!--Cette nuit, tu me loges.

DON RUY GOMEZ (_s'inclinant jusqu'� terre_).
    Merci, Altesse!

_Il appelle ses valets_.
    Faites tous honneur au roi mon h�te.

_Les valets rentrent avec des flambeaux. Le duc les range sur deux
haies jusqu'� la porte du fond. Cependant do�a Sol s'approche
lentement d'Hernani. Le roi les �pie tous deux_.

DO�A SOL (_bas � Hernani_).
    Demain, sous ma fen�tre, � minuit, et sans faute.
    Vous frapperez des mains trois fois.

HERNANI (_bas_).
    Demain.

DON CARLOS (_� part_).
    Demain!

_Haut � do�a Sol vers laquelle il fait un pas avec galanterie_.
    Souffrez que pour rentrer je vous offre la main.

_Il la reconduit � la porte. Elle sort_.

HERNANI (_la main dans sa poitrine sur la poign�e de sa dague_).
    Mon bon poignard!

DON CARLOS (_revenant, � part_).
    Notre homme a la mine attrap�e.

_Il prend � part Hernani_.
    Je vous ai fait l'honneur de toucher votre �p�e,
    Monsieur. Vous me seriez suspect pour cent raisons.
    Mais le roi don Carlos r�pugne aux trahisons.
    Allez. Je daigne encore prot�ger votre fuite.

DON RUY GOMEZ (_revenant et montrant Hernani_).
    Qu'est ce seigneur?

DON CARLOS.
    Il part. C'est quelqu'un de ma suite.

_Ils sortent avec les valets et les flambeaux, le duc pr�c�dant le
roi, une cire � la main_.




SC�NE IV.


HERNANI (_seul_).
    Oui, de ta suite, � roi[65]! de ta suite!--J'en suis!
    Nuit et jour, en effet, pas � pas, je te suis.
    Un poignard � la main, l'oeil fix� sur ta trace,
    Je vais. Ma race en moi poursuit en toi ta race.
    Et puis, te voil� donc mon rival! Un instant
    Entre aimer et ha�r je suis rest� flottant,
    Mon coeur pour elle et toi n'�tait point assez large,
    J'oubliais en l'aimant ta haine qui me charge[66]:
    Mais puisque tu le veux, puisque c'est toi qui viens
    Me faire souvenir, c'est bon, je me souviens!
    Mon amour fait pencher la balance incertaine
    Et tombe tout entier du c�t� de ma haine.
    Oui, je suis de ta suite, et c'est toi qui l'as dit!
    Va, jamais courtisan de ton lever maudit,
    jamais seigneur baisant ton ombre, ou majordome
    Ayant � te servir abjur� son coeur d'homme,
    jamais chiens de palais dress�s � suivre un roi
    Ne seront sur tes pas plus assidus que moi!
    Ce qu'ils veulent de toi, tous ces grands de Castille,
    C'est quelque titre creux, quelque hochet qui brille,
    C'est quelque mouton d'or[67] qu'on se va pendre au cou;
    Moi, pour vouloir si peu je ne suis pas si fou!
    Ce que je veux de toi, ce n'est point faveurs vaines,
    C'est l'�me de ton corps, c'est le sang de tes veines,
    C'est tout ce qu'un poignard, furieux et vainqueur,
    En y fouillant longtemps peut prendre[68] au fond d'un coeur.
    Va devant! je te suis. Ma vengeance qui veille
    Avec moi toujours marche et me parle � l'oreille.
    Va! je suis l�, j'�pie et j'�coute, et sans bruit
    Mon pas cherche ton pas et le presse et le suit.
    Le jour tu ne pourras, � roi, tourner la t�te
    Sans me voir immobile et sombre dans ta f�te;
    La nuit tu ne pourras tourner les yeux, � roi,
    Sans voir mes yeux ardents luire derri�re toi!

_Il sort par la petite porte_.




ACTE DEUXI�ME - LE BANDIT.


SARAGOSSE.

_Un patio[1] du palais de Silva. A gauche, les grands murs du palais,
avec une fen�tre � balcon. Au-dessous de la fen�tre, une petite porte.
A droite et au fond, des maisons et des rues. Il est nuit. On voit
briller �a et l�, aux fa�ades des �difices, quelques fen�tres encore
�clair�es.




SC�NE PREMI�RE.

DON CARLOS, DON SANCHO SANCHEZ DE ZUNIGA, COMTE DE MONTEREY, DON
MATIAS CENTURION, MARQUIS D'ALMU�AN, DON RICARDO DE ROXAS, SEIGNEUR DE
CASAPALMA.

_Ils arrivent tous quatre, don Carlos en t�te, chapeaux rabattus[2],
envelopp�s de longs manteaux dont leurs �p�es soul�vent le bord
inf�rieur_.

DON CARLOS (_examinant le balcon_).
    Voil� bien le balcon, la porte... Mon sang bout.

_Montrant la fen�tre qui n'est pas �clair�e_.
    Pas de lumi�re encor!

_Il prom�ne ses yeux sur les autres crois�es �clair�es_.
    Des lumi�res partout
    O� je n'en voudrais pas, hors � cette fen�tre
    O� j'en voudrais!

DON SANCHO.
    Seigneur, reparlons de ce tra�tre.
    Et vous l'avez laiss� partir!

DON CARLOS.
    Comme tu dis.

DON MATIAS.
    Et peut-�tre c'�tait le major des bandits!

DON CARLOS.
    Qu'il en soit le major ou bien le capitaine,
    Jamais roi couronn� n'eut mine plus hautaine.

DON SANCHO.
    Son nom, seigneur?

DON CARLOS (_les yeux fix�s sur la fen�tre_).
    Mufioz... Fernan...

_Avec le geste d'un homme qui se rappelle tout � coup_.
    Un nom en i.

DON SANCHO.
    Hernani, peut-�tre?

DON CARLOS.
    Oui.

DON SANCHO.
    C'est lui!

DON MATIAS.
    C'est Hernani?
    Le chef!

DON SANCHO (_au roi_).
    De ses propos vous reste-t-il m�moire?

DON CARLOS (_qui ne quitte pas la fen�tre des yeux_).
    H�! je n'entendais rien dans leur maudite armoire!

DON SANCHO.
    Mais pourquoi le l�cher lorsque vous le tenez?

_Don Carlos se tourne gravement et le regarde en face_.

DON CARLOS.
    Comte de Monterey, vous me questionnez.

_Les deux seigneurs reculent et se taisent_.
    Et d'ailleurs ce n'est point le souci qui m'arr�te.
    J'en veux � sa ma�tresse[3] et non point � sa t�te.
    J'en suis amoureux fou! Les yeux noirs les plus beaux,
    Mes amis! deux miroirs! deux rayons! deux flambeaux!
    Je n'ai rien entendu de toute leur histoire
    Que ces trois mots: Demain, venez � la nuit noire!
    Mais c'est l'essentiel. Est-ce pas excellent?
    Pendant que ce bandit, � mine de galant,
    S'attarde � quelque meurtre, � creuser quelque tombe,
    Je viens tout doucement d�nicher sa colombe.

DON RICARDO.
    Altesse, il e�t fallu, pour compl�ter le tour,
    D�nicher la colombe en tuant le vautour.

DON CARLOS (_� don Ricardo_).
    Comte! un digne conseil! vous avez la main prompte!

DON RICARDO (_s'inclinant profond�ment_).
    Sous quel titre pla�t-il au roi que je sois comte?

DON SANCHO (_vivement_).
    C'est m�prise!

DON RICARDO (_� don Sancho_).
    Le roi m'a nomm� comte.

DON CARLOS.
    Assez!
    Bien.

_A Ricardo_.
    J'ai laiss� tomber ce titre. Ramassez.

DON RIARCDO (_s'inclinant de nouveau_).
    Merci, seigneur!

DON SANCHO (_� don Matias_).
    Beau comte! un comte de surprise.

_Le roi se prom�ne au fond, examinant avec impatience les fen�tres
�clair�es. Les deux seigneurs causent sur le devant_.

DON MATIAS (_� don Sancho_).
    Mais que fera le roi, la belle une fois prise?

DON SANCHO (_regardant Ricardo de travers_).
    Il la fera comtesse, et puis dame d'honneur.
    Puis, qu'il en ait un fils[4], il sera roi.

DON MATIAS.
    Seigneur,
    Allons donc! un b�tard! Comte, f�t-on altesse[5],
    On ne saurait tirer un roi d'une comtesse!

DON SANCHO.
    Il la fera marquise, alors, mon cher marquis.

DON MATIAS.
    On garde les b�tards pour les pays conquis.
    On les fait vice-rois. C'est � cela qu'ils servent.

_Don Carlos revient_.

DON CARLOS (_regardant avec col�re toutes les fen�tres �clair�es_).
    Dirait-on pas des yeux jaloux qui nous observent?
    Enfin! en voil� deux qui s'�teignent! allons!
    Messieurs, que les instants de l'attente sont longs!
    Qui fera marcher l'heure avec plus de vitesse?

DON SANCHO.
    C'est ce que nous disons[6] souvent chez votre altesse.

DON CARLOS.
    Cependant que[7] chez vous mon peuple[8] le redit.

_La derni�re fen�tre �clair�e s'�teint_.
    --La derni�re est �teinte!

_Tourn� vers le balcon de do�a Sol toujours noir_.
    O vitrage maudit!
    Quand t'�claireras-tu?--Cette nuit est bien sombre.
    Do�a Sol, viens briller comme un astre dans l'ombre!

_A don Ricardo_.
    Est-il minuit?

DON RICARDO.
    Minuit bient�t.

DON CARLOS.
    Il faut finir
    Pourtant! A tout moment l'autre peut survenir.

_La fen�tre de do�a Sol s'�claire. On voit son ombre se dessiner sur
les vitraux lumineux_.
    Mes amis! un flambeau! son ombre � la fen�tre!
    Jamais jour ne me fut plus charmant � voir na�tre.
    H�tons-nous! faisons-lui le signal qu'elle attend.
    Il faut frapper des mains trois fois. Dans un instant,
    Mes amis, vous allez la voir!--Mais notre nombre
    Va l'effrayer peut-�tre... Allez tous trois dans l'ombre
    L�-bas, �pier l'autre. Amis, partageons-nous
    Les deux amants. Tenez, � moi la dame, � vous
    Le brigand.

DON RICARDO.
    Grand merci!

DON CARLOS.
    S'il vient, de l'embuscade
    Sortez vite, et poussez au dr�le une estocade[9].
    Pendant qu'il reprendra ses esprits sur le gr�s[10],
    J'emporterai la belle, et nous rirons apr�s,
    N'allez pas cependant le tuer! c'est un brave
    Apr�s tout, et la mort d'un homme est chose grave.

_Les deux seigneurs s'inclinent et sortent. Don Carlos les laisse
 s'�loigner, puis frappe des mains � deux reprises. A la deuxi�me fois
la fen�tre s'ouvre, et dama Sol para�t sur le balcon_.




SC�NE II.

DON CARLOS, DO�A SOL.


DO�A SOL (_au balcon_).
    Est-ce vous, Hernani?

DON CARLOS (_� part_).
    Diable! Ne parlons pas!

_Il frappe de nouveau des mains_.

DO�A SOL.
    Je descends.

_Elle referme la fen�tre, dont la lumi�re dispara�t. Un moment apr�s,
la petite porte s'ouvre, et do�a Sol en sort, une lampe � la main, sa
mante sur les �paules_.

DO�A SOL.
    Hernani!

_Don Carlos rabat son chapeau sur son visage, et s'avance
pr�cipitamment vers elle_.

DO�A SOL (_laissant tomber sa lampe_).
    Dieu! ce n'est point son pas!

_Elle veut rentrer. Don Carlos court � elle et la retient par le bras_.

DON CARLOS.
    Do�a Sol!

DO�A SOL.
    Ce n'est point sa voix! Ah! malheureuse!

DON CARLOS.
    Eh! quelle voix veux-tu qui soit plus amoureuse?
    C'est toujours un amant, et c'est un amant roi!

DO�A SOL.
    Le roi!

DON CARLOS.
    Souhaite, ordonne, un royaume est � toi!
    Car celui dont tu veux briser la douce entrave,
    C'est le roi ton seigneur, c'est Carlos ton esclave!

DO�A SOL (_cherchant � se d�gager de ses bras_).
    Au secours, Hernani!

DON CARLOS.
    Le juste et digne effroi!
    Ce n'est pas ton bandit qui te tient, c'est le roi.

DO�A SOL.
    Non. Le bandit, c'est vous! N'avez-vous pas de honte?
    Ah! pour vous � la face une rougeur me monte.
    Sont-ce l� les exploits dont le roi fera bruit[11]?
    Venir ravir de force une femme la nuit!
    Que mon bandit vaut mieux cent fois! Roi, je proclame
    Que, si l'homme naissait o� le place son �me,
    Si Dieu faisait le rang � la hauteur du coeur,
    Certe, il serait le roi, prince, et vous le voleur!

DON CARLOS (_essayant de l'attirer_).
    Madame...

DO�A SOL.
    Oubliez-vous que mon p�re �tait comte?

DON CARLOS.
    Je vous ferai duchesse.

DO�A SOL (_le repoussant_).
    Allez! c'est une honte!

_Elle recule de quelques pas_.
    Il ne peut �tre rien entre nous, don Carlos.
    Mon vieux p�re a pour vous vers� son sang � flots.
    Moi je suis fille noble, et de ce sang jalouse.
    Trop pour la concubine, et trop peu pour l'�pouse!

DON CARLOS.
    Princesse?

DO�A SOL.
    Roi Carlos, � des filles de rien
    Portez votre amourette, ou je pourrais fort bien,
    Si vous m'osez traiter d'une fa�on inf�me,
    Vous montrer que je suis dame, et que je suis femme.

DON CARLOS.
    Eh bien, partagez donc et mon tr�ne et mon nom.
    Venez. Vous serez reine, imp�ratrice!...

DO�A SOL.
    Non.
    C'est un leurre. Et d'ailleurs, altesse, avec franchise,
    S'ag�t-il pas de vous, s'il faut que je le dise,
    J'aime mieux avec lui, mon Hernani, mon roi,
    Vivre errante, en dehors du monde et de la loi,
    Ayant faim, avant soif, fuyant toute l'ann�e,
    Partageant jour � jour sa pauvre destin�e,
    Abandon, guerre, exil, deuil, mis�re et terreur,
    Que d'�tre imp�ratrice avec un empereur!

DON CARLOS.
    Que cet homme est heureux!

DO�A SOL.
    Quoi! pauvre, proscrit m�me!

DON CARLOS.
    Qu'il fait bien d'�tre pauvre et proscrit, puis qu'on l'aime!
    Moi, je suis seul! Un ange accompagne ses pas!
    --Donc vous me ha�ssez?

DO�A SOL.
    Je ne vous aime pas.

DON CARLOS (_la saisissant avec violence_).
    Eh bien, que vous m'aimiez ou non, cela n'importe!
    Vous viendrez, et ma main plus que la v�tre est forte.
    Vous viendrez! je vous veux! Pardieu, nous verrons bien
    Si je suis roi d'Espagne et des Indes pour rien!

DO�A SOL (_se d�battant_).
    Seigneur! oh! par piti�!--Quoi! vous �tes altesse,
    Vous �tes roi. Duchesse, ou marquise, ou comtesse,
    Vous n'avez qu'� choisir. Les femmes de la cour
    Ont toujours un amour tout pr�t pour votre amour.
    Mais mon proscrit, qu'a-t-il re�u du ciel avare?
    Ah! vous avez Castille, Aragon et Navarre[12],
    Et Murcie[13], et L�on, dix royaumes encor,
    Et les Flamands[14], et l'Inde[15] avec les mines d'or!
    Vous avez un empire auquel nul roi ne touche,
    Si vaste que jamais le soleil ne s'y couche!
    Et, quand vous avez tout, voudrez-vous, vous le roi,
    Me prendre, pauvre fille, � lui qui n'a que moi?

_Elle se jette � ses genoux. Il cherche � l'entra�ner_.

DON CARLOS.
    Viens! Je n'�coute rien. Viens! Si tu m'accompagnes,
    Je te donne, choisis, quatre de mes Espagnes.
    Dis, lesquelles veux-tu? Choisis!

_Elle se d�bat dans ses bras_.

DO�A SOL.
    Pour mon honneur,
    Je ne veux rien de vous que ce poignard, seigneur!

_Elle lui arrache le poignard de sa ceinture. Il la l�che et recule_.
    Avancez maintenant! faites un pas!

DON CARLOS.
    La belle!
    Je ne m'�tonne plus si l'on aime un rebelle!

_Il veut faire un pas. Elle l�ve le poignard_.

DO�A SOL.
    Pour un pas, je vous tue, et me tue.

_Il recule encore. Elle se d�tourne et crie avec force_
    Hernani! Hernani!

DON CARLOS.
    Taisez-vous!

DO�A SOL (_le poignard lev�_).
    Un pas! tout est fini.

DON CARLOS.
    Madame! � cet exc�s ma douceur est r�duite.
    J'ai l� pour vous forcer trois hommes de ma suite...

HERNANI (_surgissant tout � coup derri�re lui_).
    Vous en oubliez un[16]!

_Le roi se retourne, et voit Hernani immobile derri�re lui dans
l'ombre, les bras crois�s sous le long manteau qui l'enveloppe, et
le large bord de son chapeau relev�. Do�a Sol pousse un cri, court
� Hernani et l'entoure de ses bras_.




SCENE III.

DON CARLOS, DO�A SOL, HERNANI.


HERNANI (_immobile, les bras toujours crois�s, et ses yeux �tincelants
fix�s sur le roi_).
    Ah! le ciel m'est t�moin
    Que volontiers je l'eusse �t� chercher plus loin!

DO�A SOL.
    Hernani, sauvez-moi de lui!

HERNANI.
    Soyez tranquille,
    Mon amour!

DON CARLOS.
    Que font donc mes amis par la ville?
    Avoir laiss� passer ce chef de boh�miens!

_Appelant_.
    Monterey!

HERNANI.
    Vos amis sont au pouvoir des miens.
    Et ne r�clamez pas leur �p�e impuissante,
    Pour trois qui vous viendraient, il m'en viendrait soixante.
    Soixante dont un seul vous vaut tous quatre. Ainsi
    Vidons entre nous deux notre querelle ici.
    Quoi! vous portiez la main sur cette jeune fille!
    C'�tait d'un imprudent, seigneur roi de Castille,
    Et d'un l�che!

DON CARLOS (_souriant avec d�dain_).
    Seigneur bandit, de vous � moi
    Pas de reproche!

HERNANI.
    Il raille! Oh! je ne suis pas roi;
    Mais quand un roi m'insulte et pour surcro�t me raille;
    Ma col�re va haut et me monte � sa taille[17],
    Et, prenez garde, on craint, quand on me fait affront,
    Plus qu'un cimier de roi la rougeur de mon front!
    Vous �tes insens� si quelque espoir vous leurre.

_Il lui saisit le bras_.
    Savez-vous quelle main vous �treint � cette heure?
    �coutez. Votre p�re a fait mourir le mien,
    Je vous hais. Vous avez pris mon titre et mon bien,
    Je vous hais. Nous aimons tous deux la m�me femme,
    Je vous hais, je vous hais,--oui, je te hais dans l'�me![18]

DON CARLOS.
    C'est bien.

HERNANI.
    Ce soir pourtant ma haine �tait bien loin.
    Je n'avais qu'un d�sir, qu'une ardeur, qu'un besoin,
    Do�a Sol!--Plein d'amour, j'accourais... Sur mon �me!
    Je vous trouve essayant contre elle un rapt inf�me!
    Quoi! vous que j'oubliais, sur ma route plac�!
    Seigneur, je vous le dis, vous �tes insens�!
    Don Carlos, te voil� pris dans ton propre pi�ge.
    Ni fuite, ni secours! je te tiens et t'assi�ge!
    Seul, entour� partout d'ennemis acharn�s,
    Que vas-tu faire?

DON CARLOS (_fi�rement_).
    Allons! vous me questionnez!

HERNANI.
    Va, va, je ne veux pas qu'un bras obscur te frappe.
    Il ne sied pas qu'ainsi ma vengeance m'�chappe.
    Tu ne seras touch� par un autre que moi.
    D�fends-toi donc.

_Il tire son �p�e_.

DON CARLOS.
    Je suis votre seigneur le roi.
    Frappez. Mais pas de duel.

HERNANI.
    Seigneur, qu'il te souvienne
    Qu'hier encor ta dague a rencontr� la mienne.

DON CARLOS.
    Je le pouvais hier. J'ignorais votre nom,
    Vous ignoriez mon titre. Aujourd'hui, compagnon[19],
    Vous savez qui je suis et je sais qui vous �tes.

HERNANI.
    Peut-�tre.

DON CARLOS.
    Pas de duel. Assassinez-moi. Faites.

HERNANI.
    Crois-tu donc que les rois � moi[20] me sont sacr�s?
    ��[21], te d�fendras-tu?

DON CARLOS.
    Vous m'assassinerez!

_Hernani recule. Don Carlos fixe des yeux d'aigle sur lui_.
    Ah! vous croyez, bandits, que vos brigades viles
    Pourront impun�ment s'�pandre dans les villes?
    Que teints de sang, charg�s de meurtres, malheureux!
    Vous pourrez apr�s tout faire les g�n�reux,
    Et que nous daignerons, nous, victimes tromp�es,
    Ennoblir vos poignards du choc de nos �p�es?
    Non, le crime vous tient. Partout vous le tra�nez.
    Nous, des duels avec vous! arri�re! assassinez.

_Hernani, sombre et pensif, tourmente quelques instants de la main la
poign�e de son �p�e, puis se retourne brusquement vers le roi, et
brise la lame sur le pav�_.

HERNANI.
    Va-t'en donc!

_Le roi se tourne � demi vers lui et le regarde avec hauteur_.
    Nous aurons des rencontres meilleures.
    Va-t'en.

DON CARLOS.
    C'est bien, monsieur. Je vais dans quelques heures
    Rentrer, moi votre roi, dans le palais ducal.
    Mon premier soin sera de mander le fiscal[22].
    A-t-on fait mettre � prix votre t�te?

HERNANI.
    Oui.

DON CARLOS.
    Mon ma�tre,
    Je vous tiens de ce jour sujet rebelle et tra�tre.
    Je vous en avertis, partout je vous poursuis.
    Je vous fais mettre au ban du royaume[23].

HERNANI.
    J'y suis
    D�j�.

DON CARLOS.
    Bien.

HERNANI.
    Mais la France est aupr�s de l'Espagne.
    C'est un port[24].

DON CARLOS.
    Je vais �tre empereur d'Allemagne.
    Je vous fais mettre au ban de l'empire.

HERNANI.
    A ton gr�.
    J'ai le reste du monde o� je te braverai.
    Il est plus d'un asile o� ta puissance tombe[25].

DON CARLOS.
    Et quand j'aurai le monde?

HERNANI.
    Alors j'aurai la tombe.

DON CARLOS.
    Je saurai d�jouer vos complots insolents.

HERNANI.
    La vengeance est boiteuse, elle vient � pas lents,
    Mais elle vient.

DON CARLOS (_riant � demi, avec d�dain_).
    Toucher � la dame qu'adore
    Ce bandit!

HERNANI (_dont les yeux se rallument_).
    Songes-tu que je te tiens encore?
    Ne me rappelle pas, futur c�sar romain,
    Que je t'ai l�, ch�tif et petit dans ma main,
    Et que si je serrais cette main trop loyale
    J'�craserais dans l'oeuf ton aigle imp�riale!

DON CARLOS.
    Faites.

HERNANI.
    Va-t'en! va-t'en!

_Il �te son manteau et le jette sur les �paules du roi_.
    Fuis, et prends ce manteau.
    Car dans nos rangs pour toi je crains quelque couteau.

_Le roi s'enveloppe du manteau_.
    Pars tranquille � pr�sent. Ma vengeance alt�r�e[26]
    Pour tout autre que moi fait ta t�te sacr�e.

DON CARLOS.
    Monsieur, vous qui venez de me parler ainsi,
    Ne demandez un jour ni gr�ce ni merci!

_Il sort_.




SC�NE IV.

HERNANI, DO�A SOL.


DO�A SOL (_saisissant la main d'Hernani_).
    Maintenant, fuyons vite.

HERNANI (_la repoussant avec une douceur grave_).
    Il vous sied, mon amie,
    D'�tre dans mon malheur toujours plus raffermie,
    De n'y point renoncer, et de vouloir toujours
    Jusqu'au fond, jusqu'au bout, accompagner mes jours.
    C'est un noble dessein, digne d'un coeur fid�le!
    Mais, tu le vois, mon Dieu, pour tant accepter d'elle,
    Pour emporter joyeux dans mon antre avec moi
    Ce tr�sor de beaut� qui rend jaloux un roi,
    Pour que ma do�a Sol me suive et m'appartienne,
    Pour lui prendre sa vie et la joindre � la mienne,
    Pour l'entra�ner sans honte encore et sans regrets,
    Il n'est plus temps; je vois l'�chafaud de trop pr�s.

DO�A SOL.
    Que dites-vous?

HERNANI.
    Ce roi que je bravais en face
    Va me punir d'avoir os� lui faire gr�ce.
    Il fuit; d�j� peut-�tre il est dans son palais.
    Il appelle ses gens, ses gardes, ses valets,
    Ses seigneurs, ses bourreaux...

DO�A SOL.
    Hernani! Dieu! je tremble.
    Eh bien! h�tons-nous donc alors! fuyons ensemble!

HERNANI.
    Ensemble! non, non. L'heure en est pass�e. H�las!
    Do�a Sol, � mes yeux quand tu te r�v�las
    Bonne, et daignant m'aimer d'un amour secourable,
    J'ai bien pu vous offrir, moi, pauvre mis�rable,
    Ma montagne, mon bois, mon torrent,--ta piti�
    M'enhardissait,--mon pain de proscrit, la moiti�
    Du lit vert et touffu que la for�t me donne;
    Mais t'offrir la moiti� de l'�chafaud! pardonne,
    Do�a Sol! l'�chafaud, c'est � moi seul!

DO�A SOL.
    Pourtant
    Vous me l'aviez promis!

HERNANI (_tombant � ses genoux_).
    Ange! ah! dans cet instant
    O� la mort vient peut-�tre, o� s'approche dans l'ombre
    Un sombre d�no�ment pour un destin bien sombre,
    Je le d�clare[27] ici, proscrit, tra�nant au flanc[28]
    Un souci profond, n� dans un berceau sanglant,
    Si noir que soit le deuil qui s'�pand sur ma vie,
    Je suis un homme heureux et je veux qu'on m'envie[29];
    Car vous m'avez aim�! car vous me l'avez dit!
    Car vous avez tout bas b�ni mon front maudit!

DO�A SOL (_pench�e sur sa t�te_).
    Hernani!

HERNANI.
    Lou� soit le sort doux et propice
    Qui me mit cette fleur au bord du pr�cipice!

_Il se rel�ve_.
    Et ce n'est pas pour vous que je parle en ce lieu,
    Je parle pour le ciel qui m'�coute, et pour Dieu.

DO�A SOL.
    Souffre que je te suive.

HERNANI.
    Ah! ce serait un crime
    Que d'arracher la fleur en tombant dans l'ab�me.
    Va, j'en ai respir� le parfum, c'est assez!
    Renoue � d'autres jours[30] tes jours par moi froiss�s.
    Epouse ce vieillard. C'est moi qui te d�lie.
    Je rentre dans ma nuit. Toi, soit heureuse, oublie!

DO�A SOL.
    Non, je te suis! je veux ma part de ton linceul!
    Je m'attache � tes pas.

HERNANI (_la serrant dans ses bras_).
    Oh! laisse-moi fuir seul.

_Il la quitte avec un mouvement convulsif_.

DO�A SOL (_douloureusement et joignant les mains_).
    Hernani! tu me fuis! Ainsi donc, insens�e,
    Avoir donn� sa vie, et se voir repouss�e,
    Et n'avoir, apr�s tant d'amour et tant d'ennui[31],
    Pas m�me le bonheur de mourir pr�s de lui!

HERNANI.
    Je suis banni! je suis proscrit! je suis funeste!

DO�A SOL.
    Ah! vous �tes ingrat!

HERNANI (_revenant sur ses pas_).
    Eh bien, non! non, je reste,
    Tu le veux, me voici. Viens, oh! viens dans mes bras!
    Je reste, et resterai tant que tu le voudras.
    Oublions-les! restons.

_Il s'assied sur un banc_.
    Sieds-toi sur cette pierre.

_Il se place � ses pieds_.
    Des flammes de tes yeux inonde ma paupi�re,
    Chante-moi quelque chant comme parfois le soir
    Tu m'en chantais, avec des pleurs dans ton oeil noir.
    Soyons heureux! buvons, car la coupe est remplie,
    Car cette heure est � nous, et le reste est folie.
    Parle-moi, ravis-moi. N'est-ce pas qu'il est doux
    D'aimer et de savoir qu'on vous aime � genoux?
    D'�tre deux? d'�tre seuls? et que c'est douce chose
    De se parler d'amour la nuit quand tout repose?
    Oh! laisse-moi dormir et r�ver sur ton sein,
    Do�a Sol! mon amour! ma beaut�!

_Bruit de cloches au loin_.

DO�A SOL (_se levant effar�e_).
    Le tocsin!
    Entends-tu? le tocsin!

HERNANI (_toujours � genoux_).
    Eh non! c'est notre noce
    Qu'on sonne.

_Le bruit de cloches augmente. Cris confus, flambeaux et lumi�res �
toutes les fen�tres, sur tous les toits, dans toutes les rues_.

DO�A SOL.
    L�ve-toi! fuis! Grand Dieu! Saragosse
    S'allume!

HERNANI (_se soulevant � demi_).
    Nous aurons une noce aux flambeaux.

DO�A SOL.
    C'est la noce des morts! la noce des tombeaux!

_Bruit d'�p�es. Cris_.

HERNANI (_se recouchant sur le banc de pierre_).
    Rendormons-nous!

UN MONTAGNARD (_L'�p�e � la main, accourant_).
    Seigneur, les sbires[32], les alcades[33],
    D�bouchent dans la place en longues cavalcades!
    Alerte[34], monseigneur!

_Hernani se l�ve_.

DO�A SOL (_pale_).
    Ah! tu l'avais bien dit!

LE MONTAGNARD.
    Au secours!

HERNANI (_au montagnard_).
    Me voici. C'est bien.

CRIS CONFUS (_au dehors_).
    Mort au bandit!

HERNANI (_au montagnard_).
    Ton �p�e.

_A do�a Sol_.
    Adieu donc!

DO�A SOL.
    C'est moi qui fais ta perte!
    O� vas-tu?

_Lui montrant la petite porte_.
    Viens! Fuyons par cette porte ouverte.

HERNANI.
    Dieu! laisser mes amis! que dis-tu?

_Tumulte et cris_.

DO�A SOL.
    Ces clameurs
    Me brisent.

_Retenant Hernani_.
    Souviens-toi que si tu meurs, je meurs!

HERNANI (_la tenant embrass�e_).
    Un baiser!

DO�A SOL.
    Mon �poux! mon Hernani! mon ma�tre!

HERNANI (_la baisant au front_).
    H�las! c'est le premier.

DO�A SOL.
    C'est le dernier peut-�tre.

_Il part. Elle tombe sur le banc_.




ACTE TROISI�ME - LE VIEILLARD.


LE CHATEAU DE SILVA DANS LES MONTAGNES D'ARAGON.

_La galerie des portraits de la famille de Silva; grande salle, dont
ces portraits, entour�s de riches bordures, et surmont�s de couronnes
ducales et d'�cussons dor�s, font la d�coration. Au fond une haute
porte gothique. Entre chaque portrait une panoplie compl�te; toutes
ces armures des si�cles diff�rents_.




SC�NE PREMI�RE.

DO�A SOL, _blanche, et debout pr�s d'une table;_ DON RUY GOMEZ DE
SILVA, _assis dans son grand fauteuil ducal en bois de ch�ne_.


DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Enfin! c'est aujourd'hui! dans une heure on sera
    Ma duchesse! plus d'oncle[1]! et l'on m'embrassera!
    Mais m'as-tu pardonn�? J'avais tort, je l'avoue.
    J'ai fait rougir ton front, j'ai fait p�lir ta joue.
    J'ai soup�onn� trop vite, et je n'aurais point d�
    Te condamner ainsi sans avoir entendu.
    Que l'apparence a tort! Injustes que nous sommes!
    Certe[2], ils �taient bien l�, les deux beaux jeunes hommes.
    C'est �gal. Je devais n'en pas croire mes yeux.
    Mais que veux-tu, ma pauvre enfant? quand on est vieux!

DO�A SOL (_immobile et grave_).
    Vous reparlez toujours de cela. Qui vous bl�me?

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Moi! J'eus tort. Je devais savoir qu'avec ton �me
    On n'a point de galants lorsqu'on est do�a Sol,
    Et qu'on a dans le coeur de bon sang espagnol.

DO�A SOL.
    Certe, il est bon et pur, monseigneur, et peut-�tre
    On le verra bient�t[3].

DON RUY GOMEZ (_se levant et allant � elle_).
    �coute, on n'est pas ma�tre
    De soi-m�me, amoureux comme je suis de toi,
    Et vieux. On est jaloux, on est m�chant, pourquoi?
    Parce que l'on est vieux. Parce que beaut�, gr�ce,
    Jeunesse, dans autrui, tout fait peur, tout menace.
    Parce qu'on est jaloux des autres, et honteux
    De soi. D�rision! que cet amour boiteux,
    Qui nous remet au coeur tant d'ivresse et de flamme,
    Ait oubli�[4] le corps en rajeunissant l'�me!
    --Quand passe un jeune p�tre--oui, c'en est l�[5]!--souvent,
    Tandis que nous allons, lui chantant, moi r�vant,
    Lui dans son pr� vert, moi dans mes noires all�es,
    Souvent je dis tout bas:--O mes tours cr�nel�es,
    Mon vieux donjon ducal, que je vous donnerais,
    Oh! que je donnerais mes bl�s et mes for�ts,
    Et les vastes troupeaux qui tondent mes collines,
    Mon vieux nom, mon vieux titre, et toutes mes ruines,
    Et tous mes vieux a�eux qui bient�t m'attendront,
    Pour sa chaumi�re neuve et pour son jeune front!
    Car ses cheveux sont noirs, car son oeil reluit comme
    Le tien[6], tu peux le voir, et dire: Ce jeune homme!
    Et puis penser � moi qui suis vieux. Je le sais!
    Pourtant j'ai nom Silva[7], mais ce n'est plus assez!
    Oui, je me dis cela. Vois � quel point je t'aime!
    Le tout, pour �tre[8] jeune et beau comme toi-m�me!
    Mais � quoi vais-je ici r�ver? Moi, jeune et beau!
    Qui te dois de si loin devancer au tombeau!

DO�A SOL.
    Qui sait?

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Mais va, crois-moi, ces cavaliers frivoles
    N'ont pas d'amour si grand qu'il ne s'use en paroles[9].
    Qu'une fille aime et croie un de ces jouvenceaux,
    Elle en meurt, il en rit. Tous ces jeunes oiseaux,
    A l'aile vive et peinte[10], au langoureux ramage,
    Ont un amour qui mue ainsi que leur plumage.
    Les vieux, dont l'�ge �teint la voix et les couleurs,
    Ont l'aile plus fid�le, et, moins beaux, sont meilleurs.
    Nous aimons bien. Nos pas sont lourds? nos yeux arides?
    Nos fronts rid�s? Au coeur on n'a jamais de rides[11].
    H�las! quand un vieillard aime, il faut l'�pargner.
    Le coeur est toujours jeune et peut toujours saigner.
    Oh! mon amour n'est point comme un jouet de verre
    Qui brille et tremble; oh! non, c'est un amour s�v�re,
    Profond, solide, s�r, paternel, amical,
    De bois de ch�ne, ainsi que mon fauteuil ducal!
    Voil� comme je t'aime, et puis je t'aime encore
    De cent autres fa�ons, comme on aime l'aurore,
    Comme on aime les fleurs, comme on aime les cieux!
    De te voir tous les jours, toi, ton pas gracieux,
    Ton front pur, le beau feu de ta fi�re prunelle[12],
    je ris, et j'ai dans l'�me une f�te �ternelle!

DO�A SOL.
    H�las!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Et puis, vois-tu, le monde trouve beau,
    Lorsqu'un homme s'�teint, et lambeau par lambeau
    S'en va, lorsqu'il tr�buche au marbre de la tombe,
    Qu'une femme, ange pur, innocente colombe,
    Veille sur lui, l'abrite, et daigne encor[13] souffrir
    L'inutile vieillard qui n'est bon qu'� mourir.
    C'est une oeuvre sacr�e et qu'� bon droit on loue
    Que[14] ce supr�me effort d'un coeur qui se d�voue,
    Qui console un mourant jusqu'� la fin du jour,
    Et, sans aimer peut-�tre, a des semblants d'amour!
    Ah! tu seras pour moi cet ange au coeur de femme
    Qui du pauvre vieillard r�jouit encor[15] l'�me,
    Et de ses derniers ans[16] lui porte la moiti�,
    Fille par le respect et soeur par la piti�.

DO�A SOL.
    Loin de me pr�c�der, vous pourrez bien me suivre,
    Monseigneur. Ce n'est pas une raison pour vivre
    Que[17] d'�tre jeune. H�las! je vous le dis, souvent
    Les vieillards sont tardifs, les jeunes vont devant,
    Et leurs yeux brusquement referment leur paupi�re,
    Comme un s�pulcre ouvert dont retombe la pierre.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Oh! les sombres discours! Mais je vous gronderai,
    Enfant! un pareil jour est joyeux et sacr�.
    Comment, � ce propos[18], quand l'heure nous appelle,
    N'�tes-vous pas encor pr�te pour la chapelle?
    Mais, vite! habillez-vous. Je compte les instants.
    La parure de noce!

DO�A SOL.
    Il sera toujours temps.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Non pas.

_Entre un page_.
    Que veut Iaquez!

LE PAGE.
    Monseigneur, � la porte
    Un homme, un p�lerin, un mendiant, n'importe,
    Est l� qui vous demande asile.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Quel qu'il soit,
    Le bonheur entre avec l'�tranger qu'on re�oit.
    Qu'il vienne.--Du dehors a-t-on quelques nouvelles?
    Que dit-on de ce chef de bandits infid�les
    Qui remplit nos for�ts de sa r�bellion?

LE PAGE.
    C'en est fait d'Hernani[19], c'en est fait du lion
    De la montagne.

DO�A SOL (_� part_).
    Dieu!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Quoi!

LE PAGE.
    La bande est d�truite.
    Le roi, dit-on, s'est mis lui-m�me � leur poursuite.
    La t�te d'Hernani vaut mille �cus du roi[20]
    Pour l'instant[21]; mais on dit qu'il est mort.

DO�A SOL (_� part_).
    Quoi! sans moi,
    Hernani!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Gr�ce au ciel! il est mort, le rebelle!
    On peut se r�jouir maintenant, ch�re belle.
    Allez donc vous parer, mon amour, mon orgueil!
    Aujourd'hui, double f�te!

DO�A SOL (_� part_).
    Oh! des habits de deuil!

_Elle sort_.

DON RUY GOMEZ (_au page_).
    Fais-lui vite porter l'�crin que je lui donne.

_Il se rassied dans son fauteuil_.
    Je veux la voir par�e ainsi qu'une madone,
    Et, gr�ce � ses doux yeux, et gr�ce � mon �crin,
    Belle � faire � genoux tomber un p�lerin.
    A propos, et celui qui nous demande un g�te?
    Dis-lui d'entrer, fais-lui nos excuses, cours vite.

_Le page salue et sort_.
    Laisser son h�te attendre! ah! c'est mal!

_La porte du fond s'ouvre. Parait Hernani d�guis� en p�lerin. Le duc
se l�ve et va � sa rencontre_.




SC�NE II.

DON RUY GOMEZ, HERNANI.


_Hernani s'arr�te sur le seuil de la porte_.

HERNANI.
    Monseigneur,
    Paix et bonheur � vous[22]!

DON RUY GOMEZ (_le saluant de la main_).
    A toi paix et bonheur,
    Mon h�te!

_Hernani entre. Le duc se rassied_.
    N'es-tu pas p�lerin?

HERNANI (_s'inclinant_).
    Oui.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Sans doute
    Tu viens d'Armillas[23]?

HERNANI.
    Non. J'ai pris une autre route;
    On se battait par l�.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    La troupe du banni,
    N'est-ce pas?

HERNANI.
    Je ne sais.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Le chef, le Hernani,
    Que devient-il? sais-tu?

HERNANI.
    Seigneur, quel est cet homme?

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Tu ne le connais pas? tant pis! la grosse somme
    Ne sera point pour toi. Vois-tu, ce Hernani.
    C'est un rebelle au roi, trop longtemps impuni.
    Si tu vas � Madrid, tu le pourras voir pendre[24].

HERNANI.
    je n'y vais pas.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Sa t�te est � qui veut la prendre.

HERNANI (_� part_).
    Qu'on y vienne!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    O� vas-tu, bon p�lerin?

HERNANI.
    Seigneur,
    Je vais � Saragosse.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Un voeu fait en l'honneur
    D'un saint? de Notre-Dame?

HERNANI.
    Oui, duc, de Notre-Dame.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Del Pilar?

HERNANI.
    Del Pilar[25].

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Il faut n'avoir point d'�me
    Pour ne point acquitter les voeux qu'on fait aux saints.
    Mais, le tien accompli, n'as-tu d'autres desseins?
    Voir le Pilier, c'est l� tout ce que tu d�sires?

HERNANI.
    Oui, je veux voir br�ler les flambeaux et les cires,
    Voir Notre-Dame, au fond du sombre corridor[26],
    Luire en sa ch�sse ardente[27] avec sa chape[28] d'or,
    Et puis m'en retourner.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Fort bien.--Ton nom, mon fr�re?
    Je suis Ruy de Silva.

HERNANI (_h�sitant_).
    Mon nom?...

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Tu peux le taire
    Si tu veux. Nul n'a droit de le savoir ici.
    Viens-tu pas demander asile?

HERNANI.
    Oui, duc.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Merci!
    Sois le bienvenu. Reste, ami, ne te fais faute
    De rien[29]. Quant � ton nom, tu te nommes mon h�te.
    Qui que tu sois, c'est bien! et, sans �tre inquiet,
    J'accueillerais Satan, si Dieu me l'envoyait.

_La porte du fond s'ouvre � deux battants. Entre do�a Sol, en parure
de mari�e. Derri�re elle, pages, valets, et deux femmes portant sur un
coussin de velours un coffret d'argent cisel�, qu'elles vont d�poser
sur une table, et qui renferme un riche �crin, couronne de duchesse,
bracelets, colliers, perles et brillants p�le-m�le.--Hernani, haletant
et effar�, consid�re do�a Sol avec des yeux ardents, sans �couter le
duc_.




SC�NE III.

LES M�MES, DO�A SOL, PAGES, VALETS, FEMMES.


DON RUY GOMEZ (_continuant_).
    Voici ma Notre-Dame � moi. L'avoir pri�e
    Te portera bonheur[30].

_Il va pr�senter la main � do�a Sol, toujours p�le et grave_.
    Ma belle mari�e,
    Venez.--Quoi! pas d'anneau! pas de couronne encor!

HERNANI (_d'une voix tonnante_).
    Qui veut gagner ici mille carolus d'or[31]?

_Tous se retournent �tonn�s. Il d�chire sa robe de p�lerin, la foule
aux pieds, et en sort dans son costume de montagnard_.
    Je suis Hernani.

DO�A SOL (_� part, avec joie_).
    Ciel! vivant!

HERNANI (_aux valets_).
    Je suis cet homme
    Qu'on cherche.

_Au duc_.
    Vous vouliez savoir si je me nomme
    Perez ou Diego[32]?--Non, je me nomme Hernani.
    C'est un bien plus beau nom, c'est un nom de banni,
    C'est un nom de proscrit! Vous voyez cette t�te?
    Elle vaut assez d'or pour payer votre f�te.

_Aux valets_.
    Je vous la donne � tous. Vous serez bien pay�s!
    Prenez! liez mes mains, liez mes pieds, liez!
    Mais non, c'est inutile, une cha�ne me lie
    Que je ne romprai point?

DO�A SOL (_� part_).
    Malheureuse!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Folie!
    ��, mon h�te est un fou!

HERNANI.
    Votre h�te est un bandit.

DO�A SOL.
    Oh! ne l'�coutez pas.

HERNANI.
    J'ai dit ce que j'ai dit.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Mille carolus d'or! monsieur, la somme est forte,
    Et je ne suis pas s�r de tous mes gens.

HERNANI.
    Qu'importe!
    Tant mieux si dans le nombre il s'en trouve un qui veut.

_Aux valets_.
    Livrez-moi! vendez-moi!

DON RUY GOMEZ (_s'effor�ant de le faire taire_).
    Taisez-vous donc! on peut
    Vous prendre au mot.

HERNANI.
    Amis, l'occasion est belle!
    Je vous dis que je suis le proscrit, le rebelle,
    Hernani!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Taisez-vous!

HERNANI.
    Hernani!

DO�A SOL (_d'une voix �teinte, � son oreille_).
    Ho! tais-toi!

HERNANI (_se d�tournant � demi vers do�a Sol_).
    On se marie ici! Je veux en �tre, moi!
    Mon �pous�e aussi m'attend.

_Au duc_.
    Elle est moins belle
    Que la v�tre, seigneur, mais n'est pas moins fid�le.
    C'est la mort!

_Aux valets_.
    Nul de vous ne fait un pas encor?

DO�A SOL (_bas_).
    Par piti�!

HERNANI (_aux valets_).
    Hernani! mille carolus d'or!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    C'est le d�mon!

HERNANI (_� un jeune valet_).
    Viens, toi; tu gagneras la somme.
    Riche alors, de valet tu redeviendras homme.

_Aux valets gui restent immobiles_.
    Vous aussi, vous tremblez!	Ai-je assez de malheur!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Fr�re, � toucher ta t�te, ils risqueraient la leur.
    Fusses-tu Hernani, fusses-tu cent fois pire,
    Pour ta vie au lieu d'or offr�t-on un empire,
    Mon h�te, je te dois prot�ger en ce lieu,
    M�me contre le roi, car je te tiens de Dieu.
    S'il tombe un seul cheveu de ton front, que je meure!

_A do�a Sol_.
    Ma ni�ce, vous serez ma femme dans une heure;
    Rentrez chez vous. Je vais faire armer le ch�teau[33],
    J'en vais fermer la porte.

_Il sort. Les valets le suivent_.

HERNANI (_regardant avec d�sespoir sa ceinture d�garnie et d�sarm�e_).
    Oh! pas m�me un couteau!

_Do�a Sol, apr�s que le duc a disparu, fait quelques pas comme pour
suivre ses femmes, puis s'arr�te, et, d�s qu'elles sont sorties,
revient vers Hernani avec anxi�t�_.




SC�NE IV.

HERNANI, DO�A SOL.

_Hernani consid�re avec un regard froid et comme inattentif l'�crin
nuptial plac� sur la table; puis il hoche la t�te, et ses yeux
s'allument_.

HERNANI.
    Je vous fais compliment! Plus que je ne puis dire
    La parure me charme et m'enchante, et j'admire!

_Il s'approche de l'�crin_.
    La bague est de bon go�t,--la couronne me pla�t,
    Le collier est d'un beau travail,--le bracelet
    Est rare,--mais cent fois, cent fois moins[34] que la femme
    Qui sous un front si pur cache ce coeur inf�me!

_Examinant de nouveau le coffret_.
    Et qu'avez-vous donn� pour tout cela?--Fort bien!
    Un peu de votre amour? mais, vraiment, c'est pour rien!
    Grand Dieu! trahir ainsi! n'avoir pas honte, et vivre!

_Examinant l'�crin_.
    Mais peut-�tre apr�s tout c'est perle fausse et cuivre
    Au lieu d'or, verre et plomb, diamants d�loyaux,
    Faux saphirs, faux bijoux, faux brillants, faux joyaux!
    Ah! s'il en est ainsi, comme cette parure,
    Ton coeur est faux, duchesse, et tu n'es que dorure!

_Il revient au coffret_.
    --Mais non, non. Tout est vrai, tout est bon, tout est beau!
    Il n'oserait tromper, lui qui touche au tombeau.
    Rien n'y manque.

_Il prend l'une apr�s l'autre toutes les pi�ces de l'�crin_.
    Colliers, brillants, pendants d'oreille
    Couronne de duchesse, anneau d'or...--A merveille!
    Grand merci de l'amour s�r, fid�le et profond[35]!
    Le pr�cieux �crin!

DO�A SOL (_Elle va au coffret, y fouille, et en tire un poignard_).
    Vous n'allez pas au fond!
    --C'est le poignard qu'avec l'aide de ma patronne[36]
    Je pris au roi Carlos, lorsqu'il m'offrit un tr�ne,
    Et que je refusai, pour vous qui m'outragez[37]!

HERNANI (_tombant � ses pieds_).
    Oh! laisse qu'� genoux dans tes yeux afflig�s
    J'efface tous ces pleurs amers et pleins de charmes,
    Et tu prendras apr�s tout mon sang pour tes larmes!

DO�A SOL (_attendrie_).
    Hernani! je vous aime et vous pardonne, et n'ai
    Que de l'amour pour vous.

HERNANI.
    Elle m'a pardonn�,
    Et m'aime! Qui pourra faire aussi que moi-m�me,
    Apr�s ce que j'ai dit, je me pardonne et m'aime?
    Oh! je voudrais savoir, ange au ciel r�serv�,
    O� vous avez march�, pour baiser le pav�!

DO�A SOL.
    Ami!

HERNANI.
    Non, je dois t'�tre odieux! Mais, �coute,
    Dis-moi: Je t'aime! H�las! rassure un coeur qui doute,
    Dis-le-moi! car souvent avec ce peu de mots
    La bouche d'une femme a gu�ri bien des maux.

DO�A SOL (_absorb�e et sans l'entendre_).
    Croire que mon amour[38] e�t si peu de m�moire!
    Que jamais ils pourraient, tous ces hommes sans gloire
    Jusqu'� d'autres amours, plus nobles � leur gr�,
    Rapetisser un coeur o� son nom est entr�!

HERNANI.
    H�las! j'ai blasph�m�! Si j'�tais � ta place,
    Do�a Sol, j'en aurais assez, je serais lasse
    De ce fou furieux, de ce sombre insens�[39]
    Qui ne sait caresser qu'apr�s qu'il a bless�,
    Je lui dirais: Va-t'en!--Repousse-moi! repousse!
    Et je te b�nirai, car tu fus bonne et douce,
    Car tu m'as support� trop longtemps, car je suis
    Mauvais, je noircirais tes jours avec mes nuits,
    Car c'en est trop enfin, ton �me est belle et haute
    Et pure, et si je suis m�chant, est-ce ta faute?
    Epouse le vieux duc! il est bon, noble, il a
    Par sa m�re Olmedo[40], par son p�re Alcala[41].
    Encore un coup[42], sois riche avec lui, sois heureuse!
    Moi, sais-tu ce que peut cette main g�n�reuse
    T'offrir de magnifique? une dot de douleurs.
    Tu pourras y choisir ou du sang ou des pleurs.
    L'exil, les fers, la mort, l'effroi qui m'environne,
    C'est l� ton collier d'or, c'est ta belle couronne,
    Et jamais � l'�pouse un �poux plein d'orgueil
    N'offrit plus riche �crin de mis�re et de deuil.
    Epouse le vieillard, te dis-je; il te m�rite!
    Eh! qui jamais croira que ma t�te proscrite
    Aille avec ton front pur? qui, nous voyant tous deux,
    Toi calme et belle, moi violent, hasardeux,
    Toi paisible et croissant comme une fleur � l'ombre,
    Moi heurt� dans l'orage � des �cueils sans nombre,
    Qui dira que nos sorts suivent la m�me loi?
    Non. Dieu qui fait tout bien ne te fit pas pour moi.
    Je n'ai nul droit d'en haut sur toi, je me r�signe.
    J'ai ton coeur, c'est un vol! je le rends au plus digne.
    Jamais � nos amours le ciel n'a consenti.
    Si j'ai dit que c'�tait ton destin, j'ai menti.
    D'ailleurs, vengeance, amour, adieu! mon jour s'ach�ve.
    Je m'en vais, inutile, avec mon double r�ve,
    Honteux de n'avoir pu ni punir ni charmer,
    Qu'on m'ait fait pour ha�r[43], moi qui n'ai su qu'aimer!
    Pardonne-moi! fuis-moi! ce sont mes deux pri�res;
    Ne les rejette pas, car ce sont les derni�res.
    Tu vis et je suis mort. Je ne vois pas pourquoi
    Tu te ferais murer dans ma tombe avec moi.

DO�A SOL.
    Ingrat!

HERNANI.
    Monts d'Aragon! Galice! Estramadoure[44]!
    --Oh! je porte malheur � tout ce qui m'entoure!
    J'ai pris vos meilleurs fils, pour mes droits sans remords
    Je les ai fait combattre, et voil� qu'ils sont morts!
    C'�taient les plus vaillants de la vaillante Espagne.
    Ils sont morts! ils sont tous tomb�s dans la montagne,
    Tous sur le dos couch�s, en braves, devant Dieu,
    Et, si leurs yeux s'ouvraient, ils verraient le ciel bleu!
    Voil� ce que je fais de tout ce qui m'�pouse!
    Est-ce une destin�e � te rendre jalouse?
    Do�a Sol, prends le duc, prends l'enfer, prends le roi!
    C'est bien. Tout ce qui n'est pas moi vaut mieux que moi!
    Je n'ai plus un ami qui de moi se souvienne,
    Tout me quitte, il est temps qu'� la fin ton tour vienne,
    Car je dois �tre seul. Fuis ma contagion.
    Ne te fais pas d'aimer une religion[45]!
    Ah! par piti� pour toi, fuis!--Tu me crois peut-�tre
    Un homme comme sont tous les autres, un �tre
    Intelligent, qui court droit au but qu'il r�va.
    D�trompe-toi. Je suis une force qui va!
    Agent aveugle et sourd de myst�res fun�bres!
    Une �me de malheur faite avec des t�n�bres!
    O� vais-je? Je ne sais. Mais je me sens pouss�
    D'un souffle imp�tueux, d'un destin insens�.
    Je descends, je descends, et jamais ne m'arr�te.
    Si parfois, haletant, j'ose tourner la t�te,
    Une voix me dit: Marche! et l'ab�me est profond,
    Et de flamme ou de sang je le vois rouge au fond!
    Cependant, � l'entour de ma course farouche,
    Tout se brise, tout meurt. Malheur � qui me touche!
    Oh! fuis! d�tourne-toi de mon chemin fatal,
    H�las! sans le vouloir, je te ferais du mal!

DO�A SOL.
    Grand Dieu!

HERNANI.
    C'est un d�mon redoutable, te dis-je,
    Que le mien[46]. Mon bonheur, voil� le seul prodige
    Qui lui soit impossible. Et toi, c'est le bonheur!
    Tu n'es donc pas pour moi, cherche un autre seigneur!
    Va, si jamais le ciel � mon sort qu'il renie
    Souriait... n'y crois pas! ce serait ironie!
    Epouse le duc!

DO�A SOL.
    Donc, ce n'�tait pas assez!
    Vous aviez d�chir� mon coeur, vous le brisez!
    Ah! vous ne m'aimez plus!

HERNANI.
    Oh! mon coeur et mon �me,
    C'est toi, l'ardent foyer d'o� me vient toute flamme,
    C'est toi! Ne m'en veux pas de fuir[47], �tre ador�!

DO�A SOL.
    Je ne vous en veux pas. Seulement j'en mourrai.

HERNANI.
    Mourir! pour qui? pour moi? Se peut-il que tu meures
    Pour si peu?

DO�A SOL (_laissant �clater ses larmes_).
    Voil� tout.

_Elle tombe sur un fauteuil_.

HERNANI (_s'asseyant pr�s d'elle_).
    Oh! tu pleures! tu pleures!
    Et c'est encor ma faute! et qui me punira?
    Car tu pardonneras encor! Qui te dira
    Ce que je souffre au moins, lorsqu'une larme noie
    La flamme de tes yeux dont l'�clair est ma joie!
    Oh! mes amis sont morts[48]! Oh! je suis insens�!
    Pardonne. Je voudrais aimer, je ne le sai.
    H�las! j'aime pourtant d'une amour[49] bien profonde!
    --Ne pleure pas! mourons plut�t!--Que n'ai-je un monde?
    Je te le donnerais! Je suis bien malheureux!

DO�A SOL (_se jetant � son cou_).
    Vous �tes mon lion superbe et g�n�reux!
    Je vous aime.

HERNANI.
    Oh! l'amour serait un bien supr�me
    Si l'on pouvait mourir de trop aimer!

DO�A SOL.
    Je t'aime!
    Monseigneur! je vous aime et je suis toute � vous.

HERNANI (_laissant tomber sa t�te sur son �paule_).
    Oh! qu'un coup de poignard de toi me serait doux!

DO�A SOL (_suppliante_).
    Ah! ne craignez vous pas que Dieu ne vous punisse
    De parler de la sorte?

HERNANI (_toujours appuy� sur son sein_).
    Eh bien! qu'il nous unisse!
    Tu le veux.	Qu'il en soit ainsi[50]!--J'ai r�sist�.

_Tous deux, dans les bras l'un de l'autre, se regardent avec extase,
sans voir, sans entendre, et comme absorb�s dans leur regard. Entre
don Ruy Gomez par la porte du fond. Il regarde et s'arr�te comme
p�trifi� sur le seuil_.




SC�NE V.

HERNANI, DO�A SOL, DON RUY GOMEZ.


DON RUY GOMEZ (_immobile et croisant les bras sur le seuil de la
porte_).
    Voil� donc le pa�ment de l'hospitalit�!

DO�A SOL.
    Dieu! le duc!

_Tous deux se retournent comme r�veill�s en sursaut_.

DON RUY GOMEZ (toujours immobile).
    C'est donc l� mon salaire, mon h�te?
    --Bon seigneur, va-t'en voir si ta muraille est haute,
    Si la porte est bien close et l'archer dans sa tour,
    De ton ch�teau pour nous fais et refais le tour,
    Cherche en ton arsenal une armure � ta taille,
    Ressaye � soixante ans ton harnois[51] de bataille!
    Voici la loyaut� dont nous pa�rons ta foi!
    Tu fais cela pour nous, et nous ceci pour toi!
    Saints du ciel! j'ai v�cu plus de soixante ann�es,
    J'ai vu bien des bandits aux �mes effr�n�es,
    J'ai souvent, en tirant ma dague du fourreau,
    Fait lever sur mes pas des gibiers de bourreau[52],
    J'ai vu des assassins, des monnayeurs, des tra�tres,
    De faux valets � table empoisonnant leur ma�tres,
    J'en ai vu qui mouraient sans croix et sans pater[53],
    J'ai vu Sforce[54], j'ai vu Borgia[55], je vois Luther[56],
    Mais je n'ai jamais vu perversit� si haute
    Qui n'e�t craint le tonnerre en trahissant son h�te!
    Ce n'est pas de mon temps. Si noire trahison
    P�trifie un vieillard au seuil de sa maison,
    Et fait que le vieux ma�tre, en attendant qu'il tombe,
    A l'air d'une statue � mettre sur sa tombe.
    Maures et Castillans! quel est cet homme-ci?

_Il l�ve les yeux et les prom�ne sur les portraits qui entourent la
salle_.
    O vous, tous les Silva qui m'�coutez ici,
    Pardon si devant vous, pardon si ma col�re
    Dit l'hospitalit� mauvaise conseill�re!

HERNANI (_se levant_).
    Duc...

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Tais-toi!

_Il fait lentement trois pas dans la salle et prom�ne de
nouveau ses regards sur les portraits des Silva_.
    Morts sacr�s! a�eux! hommes de fer!
    Qui voyez ce qui vient du ciel et de l'enfer,
    Dites-moi, messeigneurs, dites, quel est cet homme?
    Ce n'est pas Hernani, c'est Judas qu'on le nomme!
    Oh! t�chez de parler pour me dire son nom!

_Croisant les bras_.
    Avez-vous de vos jours vu rien de pareil? Non!

HERNANI.
    Seigneur duc...

DON RUY GOMEZ (_toujours aux portraits_).
    Voyez-vous, il veut parler, l'inf�me!
    Mais, mieux encor que moi, vous lisez dans son �me.
    Oh! ne l'�coutez pas! C'est un fourbe! Il pr�voit
    Que mon bras va sans doute ensanglanter mon toit,
    Que peut-�tre mon coeur couve dans ses temp�tes
    Quelque vengeance, soeur du festin des sept t�tes[57],
    Il vous dira qu'il est proscrit, il vous dira
    Qu'on va dire Silva comme l'on dit Lara,
    Et puis qu'il est mon h�te, et puis qu'il est votre h�te...
    Mes a�eux, mes seigneurs, voyez, est-ce ma faute?
    Jugez entre nous deux!

HERNANI.
    Ruy Gomez de Silva,
    Si jamais vers le ciel noble front s'�leva,
    Si jamais coeur fut grand, si jamais �me haute,
    C'est la v�tre, seigneur! c'est la tienne, � mon h�te!
    Moi qui te parle ici, je suis coupable, et n'ai
    Rien � dire, sinon que je suis bien damn�.
    Oui, j'ai voulu te prendre et t'enlever ta femme,
    Oui, j'ai voulu souiller ton lit, oui, c'est inf�me!
    J'ai du sang. Tu feras tr�s bien de le verser,
    D'essuyer ton �p�e et de n'y plus penser!

DO�A SOL.
   Seigneur, ce n'est pas lui! Ne frappez que moi-m�me!

HERNANI.
    Taisez-vous, do�a Sol. Car cette heure est supr�me.
    Cette heure m'appartient. Je n'ai plus qu'elle. Ainsi
    Laissez-moi m'expliquer avec le duc ici.
    Duc, crois aux derniers mots de ma bouche; j'en jure[58],
    Je suis coupable, mais sois tranquille,--elle est pure!
    C'est l� tout. Moi coupable, elle pure; ta foi
    Pour elle, un coup d'�p�e ou de poignard pour moi.
    Voil�.--Puis fais jeter le cadavre � la porte
    Et laver le plancher, si tu veux, il n'importe!

DO�A SOL.
    Ah! moi seule ai tout fait.	Car je l'aime.

_Don Ruy se d�tourne � ce mot en tressaillant, et fixe sur do�a Sol
un regard terrible. Elle se jette � ses genoux_.
    Oui, pardon!
    Je l'aime, monseigneur!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Vous l'aimez!

_A Hernani_.
    Tremble donc!

_Bruit de trompettes au dehors.--Entre le page. Au page_
    Qu'est ce bruit?

LE PAGE.
    C'est le roi, monseigneur, en personne,
    Avec un gros d'archers et son h�raut qui sonne.

DO�A SOL.
    Dieu! le roi! Dernier coup!

LE PAGE (_au duc_).
    Il demande pourquoi
    La porte est close, et veut qu'on ouvre.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Ouvrez au roi.

_Le page s'incline et sort_.

DO�A SOL.
    Il est perdu!

_Don Ruy Gomez va � l'un des tableaux, qui est son propre portrait et
le dernier � gauche; il presse un ressort, le portrait s'ouvre comme
une porte, et laisse voir une cachette pratiqu�e dans le mur. Il se
tourne vers Hernani_.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Monsieur, venez ici.

HERNANI.
    Ma t�te
    Est � toi. Livre-la, seigneur. Je la tiens pr�te.
    Je suis ton prisonnier.

_Il entre dans la cachette. Don Ruy presse de nouveau le ressort,
tout se referme, et le portrait revient � sa place_.

DO�A SOL (_au duc_).
    Seigneur, piti� pour lui!

LE PAGE (_entrant_).
    Son altesse le roi.

_Do�a Sol baisse pr�cipitamment son voile. La porte s'ouvre � deux
battants. Entre don Carlos en habit de guerre, suivi d'une foule de
gentilshommes �galement arm�s, de pertuisaniers, d'arquebusiers,
d'arbal�triers_.




SC�NE VI.

DON RUY GOMEZ; DO�A SOL (_voil�e_); DON CARLOS; SUITE.

_Don Carlos s'avance � pas lents, la main gauche sur le pommeau de son
�p�e, la droite dans sa poitrine, et fixe sur le vieux duc un oeil
de d�fiance et de col�re. Le duc va au devant du roi et le salue
profond�ment.--Silence.--Attente et terreur alentour. Enfin, le roi,
arriv� en face du duc, l�ve brusquement la t�te_.

DON CARLOS.
    D'o� vient donc aujourd'hui,
    Mon cousin, que ta porte est si bien verrouill�e?
    Par les saints! je croyais ta dague plus rouill�e!
    Et je ne savais pas qu'elle e�t h�te � ce point,
    Quand nous te venons voir, de reluire � ton poing[59]!

_Don Ruy Gomez veut parler, le roi poursuit avec un geste imp�rieux_.
    C'est s'y prendre un peu tard[60] pour faire le jeune homme!
    Avons-nous des turbans? serait-ce qu'on me nomme
    Boabdil[61] ou Mahom[62], et non Carlos, r�pond!
    Pour nous baisser la herse et nous lever le pont?

DON RUY GOMEZ (_s'inclinant_).
    Seigneur...

DON CARLOS (_� ses gentilshommes_).
    Prenez les clefs! saissisez-vous des portes!

_Deux officiers sortent. Plusieurs autres rangent les soldats en
triple haie dans la salle, du roi � la grande porte. Don Carlos se
retourne vers le duc_.
    Ah! vous r�veillez donc les r�bellions mortes?
    Pardieu! si vous prenez de ces airs avec moi.
    Messieurs les ducs, le roi prendra des airs de roi
    Et j'irai par les monts, de mes mains aguerries,
    Dans leurs nids cr�nel�s tuer les seigneuries!

DON RUY GOMEZ (_se redressant_).
    Altesse, les Silva sont loyaux...

DON CARLOS (l'interrompant).
    Sans d�tours
    R�ponds, duc, ou je fais raser tes onze tours!
    De l'incendie �teint il reste une �tincelle,
    Des bandits morts il reste un chef.--Qui le rec�le?
    C'est toi! Ce Hernani, rebelle empoisonneur,
    Ici, dans ton ch�teau, tu le caches!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Seigneur,
    C'est vrai.

DON CARLOS.
    Fort bien. Je veux sa t�te,--ou bien la tienne,
    Entends-tu, mon cousin?

DON RUY GOMEZ (_s'inclinant_).
    Mais qu'� cela ne tienne[63]!
    Vous serez satisfait.

_Do�a Sol cache sa t�te dans ses mains et tombe sur le fauteuil_.

DON CARLOS (_radouci_).
    Ah! tu t'amendes.--Va
    Chercher mon prisonnier.

_Le duc croise les bras, baisse la t�te et reste quelques moments
r�veur. Le roi et do�a Sol l'observent en silence et agit�s
d'�motions contraires. Enfin le duc rel�ve son front, va au roi, lui
prend la main, et le m�ne � pas lents devant le plus ancien des
portraits, celui qui commence la galerie � droite_.

DON RUY GOMEZ (_montrant au roi le vieux portrait_).
    Celui-ci, des Silva
    C'est l'a�n�, c'est l'a�eul, l'anc�tre, le grand homme!
    Don Silvius[64], qui fut trois fois consul de Rome.

_Passant au portrait suivant_.
    Voici don Galceran de Silva, l'autre Cid!
    On lui garde � Toro[65], pr�s de Valladolid[66],
    Une ch�sse dor�e o� br�lent mille cierges.
    Il affranchit L�on du tribut des cent vierges[67].

_Passant � un autre_.
    --Don Blas,--qui, de lui-m�me et dans sa bonne foi,
    S'exila pour avoir mal conseill� le roi.

_A un autre_.
    --Christoval.--Au combat d'Escalona, don Sanche,
    Le roi, fuyait � pied, et sur sa plume blanche
    Tous les coups s'acharnaient; il cria: Christoval!
    Christoval prit la plume et donna son cheval.

_A un autre_.
    --Don Jorge, qui paya la ran�on de Ramire[68],
    Roi d'Aragon.

DON CARLOS (_croisant les bras et le regardant de la t�te aux pieds_).
    Pardieu! don Ruy, je vous admire!
    Continuez!

DON RUY GOMEZ (_passant � un autre_).
    Voici Ruy Gomez de Silva,
    Grand-ma�tre de Saint-Jacque et de Calatrava[69].
    Son armure g�ante irait mal � nos tailles.
    Il prit trois cents drapeaux, gagna trente batailles,
    Conquit au roi Motril[70], Antequera[71], Suez[72],
    Nijar[73], et mourut pauvre.--Altesse, saluez.

_Il s'incline, se d�couvre, et passe � un autre. Le roi l'�coute
avec une impatience et une col�re toujours croissantes_.
    Pr�s de lui, Gil son fils, cher aux �mes loyales.
    Sa main pour un serment valait les mains royales.

_A un autre_.
    --Don Gaspard, de Mendoce et de Silva l'honneur!
    Toute noble maison tient � Silva[74], seigneur.
    Sandoval tour � tour nous craint ou nous �pouse,
    Manrique nous envie et Lara nous jalouse.
    Alencastre[75] nous hait. Nous touchons � la fois
    Du pied � tous les ducs, du front � tous les rois!

DON CARLOS.
    Vous raillez-vous?

DON RUY GOMEZ (_allant � d'autres portraits_).
    Voil� don Vasquez, dit le Sage,
    Don Jayme, dit le Fort. Un jour, sur son passage,
    Il arr�ta Zamet[76] et cent maures tout seul.
    --J'en passe, et des meilleurs.

_Sur un geste de col�re du roi, il passe un grand nombre de tableaux,
et vient tout de suite aux trois derniers portraits � gauche du
spectateur_.
    Voici mon noble a�eul.
    Il v�cut soixante ans, gardant la foi jur�e,
    M�me aux juifs.

_A l'avant-dernier_.
    Ce vieillard, cette t�te sacr�e,
    C'est mon p�re. Il fut grand, quoi qu'il vint le dernier.
    Les maures de Grenade avaient fait prisonnier
    Le comte Alvar Giron, son ami. Mais mon p�re
    Prit pour l'aller chercher six cents hommes de guerre;
    Il fit tailler en pierre un comte Alvar Giron
    Qu'� sa suite il traina, jurant par son patron
    De ne point reculer que le comte de pierre
    Ne tourn�t front lui-m�me et n'all�t en arri�re.
    Il combattit, puis vint au comte, et le sauva.

DON CARLOS
    Mon prisonnier!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    C'�tait un Gomez de Silva.
    Voil� donc ce qu'on dit quand dans cette demeure
    On voit tous ces h�ros...

DON CARLOS.
    Mon prisonnier sur l'heure!

DON RUY GOMEZ (_Il s'incline profond�ment devant le roi, lui prend la
main et le m�ne devant le dernier portrait, celui qui sert de porte �
la cachette o� il a fait entrer Hernani. Do�a Sol le suit des yeux
avec anxi�t�.--Attente et silence dans l'assistance_.
    Ce portrait, c'est le mien.--Roi don Carlos, merci!
    Car vous voulez qu'on dise en le voyant ici:
    �Ce dernier, digne fils d'une race si haute,
    Fut un tra�tre, et vendit la t�te de son h�te!�

_Joie de dora Sol. Mouvement de stupeur dans les assistants. Le roi,
d�concert�, s'�loigne avec col�re. Puis reste quelques instants
silencieux, les l�vres tremblantes et l'oeil enflamm�_.

DON CARLOS.
    Duc, ton ch�teau me g�ne et je le mettrai bas!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Car vous me la pa�riez[77], altesse, n'est-ce pas?

DON CARLOS.
    Duc, j'en ferai raser les tours pour tant d'audace,
    Et je ferai semer du chanvre sur la place.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Mieux voir cro�tre du chanvre o� ma tour s'�leva
    Qu'une tache ronger le vieux nom de Silva.

_Aux portraits_.
   N'est-il pas vrai, vous tous?

DON CARLOS.
    Duc, cette t�te est n�tre[78],
    Et tu m'avais promis...

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    J'ai promis l'une ou l'autre,

_Aux portraits_.
    N'est-il pas vrai, vous tous?

_Montrant sa t�te_.
    Je donne celle-ci.

_Au roi_.
    Prenez-la.

DON CARLOS.
    Duc, fort bien. Mais j'y perds, grand merci[79]!
    La t�te qu'il me faut est jeune, il faut que morte
    On la prenne aux cheveux. La tienne? que m'importe!
    Le bourreau la prendrait par les cheveux en vain.
    Tu n'en as pas assez pour lui remplir la main!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Altesse, pas d'affront! ma t�te encore est belle,
    Et vaut bien, que je crois, la t�te d'un rebelle.
    La t�te d'un Silva, vous �tes d�go�t�!

DON CARLOS.
    Livre-nous Hernani!

DON Ruy GOMEZ.
    Seigneur, en v�rit�,
    J'ai dit.

DON CARLOS (_� sa suite_).
    Fouillez partout! et qu'il ne soit point d'aile,
    De cave ni de tour...

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Mon donjon est fid�le
    Comme moi. Seul il sait le secret avec moi.
    Nous le garderons bien tous deux.

DON CARLOS.
    Je suis le roi!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Hors que de mon ch�teau d�moli pierre � pierre
    On ne fasse ma tombe, on n'aura rien.

DON CARLOS.
    Pri�re,
    Menace, tout est vain!--Livre-moi le bandit,
    Duc! ou t�te et ch�teau, j'abattrai tout.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    J'ai dit.

DON CARLOS.
    Eh bien donc! au lieu d'une alors j'aurai deux t�tes.

_Au duc d'Alcala_[80].
    Jorge, arr�tez le duc.

DO�A SOL (_arrachant son voile et se jetant entre le roi, le duc, et
les gardes_).
    Roi don Carlos, vous �tes
    Un mauvais roi!

DON CARLOS.
    Grand Dieu! Que vois-je? do�a Sol!

DO�A SOL.
    Altesse, tu n'as pas le coeur d'un Espagnol!

DON CARLOS (_troubl�_).
    Madame, pour le roi vous �tes bien s�v�re.

_Il s'approche de do�a Sol. Bas_.
    C'est vous qui m'avez mis au coeur cette col�re.
    Un homme devient ange ou monstre en vous touchant.
    Ah! quand on est ha�, que vite[81] on est m�chant!
    Si vous aviez voulu, peut-�tre, � jeune fille,
    J'�tais grand, j'eusse �t� le lion de Castille!
    Vous m'en faites le tigre avec votre courroux.
    Le voil� qui rugit, madame, taisez-vous!

_Do�a Sol lui jette un regard. Il s'incline_.
    Pourtant, j'ob�irai.

_Se tournant vers le duc_.
    Mon cousin, je t'estime.
    Ton scrupule apr�s tout peut sembler l�gitime.
    Sois fid�le � ton h�te, infid�le � ton roi,
    C'est bien, je te fais gr�ce et suis meilleur que toi.
    --J'emm�ne seulement ta ni�ce comme otage.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Seulement!

DO�A SOL (_interdite_).
    Moi, seigneur!

DON CARLOS.
    Oui, vous.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Pas davantage!
    O la grande cl�mence! � g�n�reux vainqueur,
    Qui m�nage la t�te et torture le coeur!
    Belle gr�ce!

DON CARLOS.
    Choisis. Do�a Sol ou le tra�tre.
    Il me faut l'un des deux.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Ah! vous �tes le ma�tre!

_Don Carlos s'approche de do�a Sol pour l'emmener. Elle se
r�fugie vers don Ruy Gomez_.

DO�A SOL.
    Sauvez-moi, monseigneur!

_Elle s'arr�te.--A part_.
    Malheureuse, il le faut!
    La t�te de mon oncle ou l'autre!... Moi plut�t!

_Au roi_.
    Je vous suis.

DON CARLOS (_� part_).
    Par les saints! l'id�e est triomphante!
    Il faudra bien enfin s'adoucir, mon infante[82]!

_Do�a Sol va d'un pas grave et assur� au coffret qui renferme l'�crin,
l'ouvre et y prend le poignard, qu'elle cache dans son sein. Don
Carlos vient � elle et lui pr�sente la main_.

DON CARLOS (_� do�a Sol_).
    Qu'emportez-vous l�?

DO�A SOL.
    Rien.

DON CARLOS.
    Un joyau pr�cieux?

DO�A SOL.
    Oui.

DON CARLOS (_souriant_).
    Voyons.

DO�A SOL.
    Vous verrez.

_Elle lui donne la main et se dispose � le suivre. Don Ruy Gomez, qui
est rest� immobile et profond�ment absorb� dans sa pens�e, se
retourne et fait quelques pas en criant_.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Do�a Sol! terre et cieux!
    Do�a Sol!--Puisque l'homme ici n'a point d'entrailles,
    A mon aide! croulez, armures et murailles!

_Il court au roi_.
    Laisse-moi mon enfant! je n'ai qu'elle, � mon roi!

DON CARLOS (l�chant la main de do�a Sol).
    Alors, mon prisonnier!

_Le duc baisse la t�te et semble en proie � une horrible h�sitation;
puis il se rel�ve, et regarde les portraits en joignant les mains
vers eux_.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Ayez piti� de moi,
    Vous tous!

_Il fait un pas vers la cachette; do�a Sol le suit des yeux avec
anxi�t�. Il se retourne vers les portraits_.
    Oh! voilez-vous! votre regard m'arr�te.

_Il s'avance en chancelant jusqu'� son portrait, puis se retourne
encore vers le roi_.
    Tu le veux?

DON CARLOS.
    Oui.

_Le duc l�ve en tremblant la main vers le ressort_.

DO�A SOL.
    Dieu!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Non!

_Il se jette aux genoux du roi_.
    Par piti�, prends ma t�te!

DON CARLOS.
    Ta ni�ce!

DON RUY GOMEZ (_se relevant_).
    Prends-la donc! et laisse-moi l'honneur!

DON CARLOS (_saisissant la main de do�a Sol tremblante_).
    Adieu, duc.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Au revoir!

_Il suit de l'oeil le roi, qui se retire lentement avec do�a Sol; puis
il met la main sur son poignard_.
    Dieu vous garde, seigneur!

_Il revient sur le devant, haletant, immobile, sans plus rien voir
ni entendre, l'oeil fixe, les bras crois�s sur sa poitrine, qui les
soul�ve comme par des mouvements convulsifs. Cependant le roi sort
avec do�a Sol, et toute la suite des seigneurs sort apr�s lui, deux
� deux, gravement et chacun � son rang. Ils se parlent � voix basse
entre eux_.

DON RUY GOMEZ (� part).
    Roi, pendant que tu sors joyeux de ma demeure,
    Ma vieille loyaut� sort de mon coeur qui pleure.

_Il l�ve les yeux, les prom�ne autour de lui, et voit qu'il est seul.
Il court � la muraille, d�tache deux �p�es d'une panoplie, les mesure
toutes deux, puis les d�pose sur une table. Cela fait, il va au
portrait, pousse le ressort, la porte cach�e se rouvre_.




SC�NE VII.

DON RUY GOMEZ, HERNANI.


DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Sors.

_Hernani parait � la porte de la cachette. Don Ruy lui montre les deux
�p�es sur la table_.
    Choisis.--Don Carlos est hors de la maison.
    Il s'agit maintenant de me rendre raison.
    Choisis. Et faisons vite.--Allons donc! ta main tremble!

HERNANI.
    Un duel! Nous ne pouvons, vieillard, combattre ensemble.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Pourquoi donc? As-tu peur? N'est-tu point noble?
    Enfer!
    Noble ou non, pour croiser le fer avec le fer,
    Tout homme qui m'outrage est assez gentilhomme!

HERNANI.
    Vieillard...

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Viens me tuer ou viens mourir, jeune homme.

HERNANI.
    Mourir, oui. Vous m'avez sauv� malgr� mes voeux[83].
    Donc, ma vie est � vous. Reprenez-la.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Tu veux?

_Aux portraits_.
    Vous voyez qu'il le veut.

_A Hernani_.
    C'est bon. Fais ta pri�re.

HERNANI.
    Oh! c'est � toi, seigneur, que je fais la derni�re.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Parle � l'autre Seigneur.

HERNANI.
    Non, non, � toi! Vieillard,
    Frappe-moi. Tout m'est bon, dague, �p�e ou poignard.
    Mais fais-moi, par piti�, cette supr�me joie!
    Duc, avant de mourir, permets que je la voie!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    La voir!

HERNANI.
    Au moins permets que j'entende sa voix
    Une derni�re fois! rien qu'une seule fois!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    L'entendre!

HERNANI.
    Oh! je comprends, seigneur, ta jalousie.
    Mais d�j� par la mort ma jeunesse est saisie,
    Pardonne-moi. Veux-tu, dis-moi, que, sans la voir,
    S'il le faut, je l'entende? et je mourrai ce soir.
    L'entendre seulement! contente[84] mon envie!
    Mais, oh! qu'avec douceur j'exhalerais ma vie,
    Si tu daignais vouloir qu'avant de fuir aux cieux
    Mon �me all�t revoir la sienne dans ses yeux!
    --Je ne lui dirai rien. Tu seras l�, mon p�re.
    Tu me prendras apr�s.

DON RUY GOMEZ (_montrant la cachette encore ouverte_).
    Saints du ciel! ce repaire
    Est-il donc si profond, si sourd et si perdu,
    Qu'il n'ait entendu rien?

HERNANI.
    Je n'ai rien entendu.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Il a fallu livrer do�a Sol ou toi-m�me.

HERNANI.
    A qui, livr�e?

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Au roi.

HERNANI.
    Vieillard stupide! il l'aime.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Il l'aime!

HERNANI.
    Il nous l'enl�ve! il est notre rival!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    O mal�diction!--Mes vassaux! A cheval!
    A cheval! poursuivons le ravisseur!

HERNANI.
    �coute.
    La vengeance au pied s�r fait moins de bruit en route.
    Je t'appartiens. Tu peux me tuer. Mais veux-tu
    M'employer � venger ta ni�ce et sa vertu?
    Ma part dans ta vengeance! oh! fais-moi cette gr�ce.
    Et, s'il faut embrasser tes pieds, je les embrasse!
    Suivons le roi tous deux. Viens, je serai ton bras,
    Je te vengerai, duc. Apr�s, tu me tueras.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Alors, comme aujourd'hui, te laisseras-tu faire[85]?

HERNANI.
    Oui, duc.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Qu'en jures-tu?

HERNANI.
    La t�te de mon p�re.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Voudras-tu de toi-m�me un jour t'en souvenir?

HERNANI (_lui pr�sentant le cor qu'il d�tache de sa ceinture_).
    �coute. Prends ce cor.--Quoi qu'il puisse advenir,
    Quand tu voudras, seigneur, quel que soit le lieu, l'heure,
    S'il te passe � l'esprit qu'il est temps que je meure,
    Viens, sonne de ce cor[86], et ne prends d'autres soins.
    Tout sera fait.

DON RUY GOMEZ (_lui tendant la main_).
    Ta main.

_Ils se serrent la main.--Aux portraits_.
    Vous tous, soyez t�moins!




ACTE QUATRI�ME - LE TOMBEAU.


AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.

_Les caveaux qui renferment le tombeau de Charlemagne �
Aix-la-Chapelle[1]. De grandes vo�tes d'architecture lombarde. Gros
piliers bas, pleins cintres, chapiteaux d'oiseaux et de fleurs.--A
droite, le tombeau de Charlemagne, avec une petite porte de bronze,
basse et cintr�e. Une seule lampe suspendue � une clef de vo�te en
�claire l'inscription: KAROLVS MAGNVS.--Il est nuit. On ne voit pas
le fond du souterrain; l'ail se perd dans les arcades, les escaliers
et les piliers qui s'entre croisent dans l'ombre_.




SC�NE PREMI�RE.

DON CARLOS, DON RICARDO DE ROXAS, COMTE DE CASAPALMA (_une lanterne
� la main. Grands manteaux, chapeaux rabattus_).


DON RICARDO (_son chapeau � la main_).
    C'est ici.

DON CARLOS.
    C'est ici que la ligue s'assemble!
    Que je vais dans ma main les tenir tous ensemble!
    Ah! monsieur l'�lecteur de Tr�ves[2], c'est ici!
    Vous leur pr�tez ce lieu! Certe, il est bien choisi!
    Un noir complot prosp�re � l'air des catacombes.
    Il est bon d'aiguiser les stylets sur des tombes.
    Pourtant c'est jouer gros. La t�te est de l'enjeu,
    Messieurs les assassins! et nous verrons.--Pardieu!
    Ils font bien de choisir pour une telle affaire
    Un s�pulcre,--ils auront moins de chemin � faire.

_A don Ricardo_.
    Ces caveaux sous le sol s'�tendent-ils bien loin?

DON RICARDO.
    Jusques au ch�teau-fort.

DON CARLOS.
    C'est plus qu'il n'est besoin.

DON RICARDO.
    D'autres, de ce c�t�, vont jusqu'au monast�re
    D'Altenheim...

DON CARLOS.
    O� Rodolphe extermina Lothaire[3].
    Bien.--Une fois encor, comte, redites-moi
    Les noms et les griefs, o�, comment, et pourquoi.

DON RICARDO.
    Gotha[4].

DON CARLOS.
    Je sais pourquoi le brave duc conspire.
    Il veut un Allemand d'Allemagne � l'Empire.

DON RICARDO.
    Hohenbourg.

DON CARLOS.
    Hohenbourg aimerait mieux, je croi[5],
    L'enfer avec Fran�ois que le ciel avec moi.

DON RICARDO.
    Don Gil Tellez Giron.

DON CARLOS.
    Castille et Notre-Dame!
    Il se r�volte donc contre son roi, l'inf�me!

DON RICARDO.
    On dit qu'il vous trouva chez madame Giron
    Un soir que vous veniez de le faire baron.
    Il veut venger l'honneur de sa tendre compagne.

DON CARLOS.
    C'est donc qu'il se r�volte alors contre l'Espagne.
    --Qui nomme-t-on encore?

DON RICARDO.
    On cite avec ceux-l�
    Le r�v�rend Vasquez, �v�que d'Avila.

DON CARLOS.
    Est-ce aussi pour venger la vertu de sa femme?

DON RICARDO.
    Puis Guzman de Lara, m�content, qui r�clame
    Le collier de votre ordre.

DON CARLOS.
    Ah! Guzman de Lara!
    Si ce n'est qu'un collier qu'il lui faut, il l'aura.

DON RICARDO.
    Le duc de Lutzelbourg[6]. Quant aux plans qu'on lui pr�te...

DON CARLOS.
    Le duc de Lutzelbourg est trop grand de la t�te[7].

DON RICARDO.
    Juan de Haro, qui veut Astorga[8].

DON CARLOS.
    Ces Haro
    Ont toujours fait doubler la solde du bourreau[9].

DON RICARDO.
    C'est tout.

DON CARLOS.
    Ce ne sont pas toutes mes t�tes. Comte,
    Cela ne fait que sept, et je n'ai pas mon compte.

DON RICARDO.
    Ah! je ne nomme pas quelques bandits, gag�s
    Par Tr�ve ou par la France...

DON CARLOS.
    Hommes sans pr�jug�s
    Dont le poignard, toujours pr�t � jouer son r�le,
    Tourne aux plus gros �cus, comme l'aiguille au p�le!

DON RICARDO.
    Pourtant j'ai distingu� deux hardis compagnons[10],
    Tous deux nouveaux venus. Un jeune, un vieux.

DON CARLOS.
    Leurs noms?

_Don Ricardo l�ve les �paules en signe d'ignorance_.
    Leur �ge?

DON RICARDO.
    Le plus jeune a vingt ans.

DON CARLOS.
    C'est dommage.

DON RICARDO.
    Le vieux, soixante au moins.

DON CARLOS.
    L'un n'a pas encor l'�ge,
    Et l'autre ne l'a plus. Tant pis. J'en prendrai soin.
    Le bourreau peut compter sur mon aide au besoin.
    Ah! loin que mon �p�e aux factions soit douce,
    Je la lui pr�terai si sa hache s'�mousse,
    Comte, et pour l'�largir[11], je coudrai, s'il le faut,
    Ma pourpre imp�riale au drap de l'�chafaud.
    --Mais serai-je empereur seulement?

DON RICARDO.
    Le coll�ge,
    A cette heure assembl�, d�lib�re.

DON CARLOS.
    Que sais-je?
    Ils nommeront Fran�ois premier, ou leur Saxon,
    Leur Fr�d�ric le Sage!--Ah! Luther a raison,
    Tout va mal!--Beaux faiseurs de majest�s sacr�es!
    N'acceptant pour raisons que les raisons dor�es!
    Un Saxon h�r�tique[12]! un comte palatin
    Imb�cile! un primat de Tr�ves libertin!
    --Quant au roi de Boh�me, il est pour moi.--Des princes
    De Hesse[13], plus petits encor que leurs provinces!
    De jeunes idiots! des vieillards d�bauch�s!
    Des couronnes, fort bien! mais des t�tes? cherchez!
    Des nains! que je pourrais, concile ridicule,
    Dans ma peau de lion emporter comme Hercule[14]!
    Et qui, d�maillot�s du manteau violet,
    Auraient la t�te encor de moins que Triboulet[15]
    --Il me manque trois voix, Ricardo! tout me manque!
    Oh! je donnerais Gand, Tol�de et Salamanque[16],
    Mon ami Ricardo, trois villes � leur choix,
    Pour trois voix, s'ils voulaient! Vois-tu, pour ces trois voix,
    Oui, trois de mes cit�s de Castille ou de Flandre[17],
    Je les donnerais!--sauf, plus tard, � les reprendre[18]!

_Don Ricardo salue profond�ment le roi, et met son chapeau sur sa
t�te_.
    --Vous vous couvrez[19]?

DON RICARDO.
    Seigneur, vous m'avez tutoy�.

_Saluant de nouveau_.
    Me voil� grand d'Espagne.

DON CARLOS (_� part_).
    Ah! tu me fais piti�,
    Ambitieux de rien!--Engeance int�ress�e!
    Comme � travers la n�tre ils suivent leur pens�e!
    Basse-cour o� le roi, mendi� sans pudeur,
    A tous ces affam�s �miette la grandeur!

_R�vant_.
    Dieu seul et l'empereur sont grands!--et le saint-p�re!
    Le reste, rois et ducs! qu'est cela?

DON RICARDO.
    Moi, j'esp�re
    Qu'ils prendront votre altesse.

DON CARLOS (_� part_).
    Altesse! altesse, moi!
    J'ai du malheur en tout.--S'il fallait rester roi!

DON RICARDO (_� part_).
    Baste[20]! empereur ou non, me voil� grand d'Espagne.

DON CARLOS.
    Sit�t qu'ils auront fait l'empereur d'Allemagne,
    Quel signal � la ville annoncera son nom?

DON RICARDO.
    Si c'est le duc de Saxe, un seul coup de canon.
    Deux, si c'est le Fran�ais. Trois, si c'est votre altesse.

DON CARLOS.
    Et cette do�a Sol! Tout m'irrite et me blesse!
    Comte, si je suis fait empereur, par hasard,
    Cours la chercher. Peut-�tre on voudra d'un c�sar[21]!

DON RICARDO (_souriant_).
    Votre altesse est bien bonne!

DON CARLOS (_l'interrompant avec hauteur_).
    Ah! l�-dessus, silence!
    Je n'ai point dit encor ce que je veux qu'on pense.
    --Quand saura-t-on le nom de l'�lu?

DON RICARDO.
    Mais, je crois,
    Dans une heure au plus tard.

DON CARLOS.
    Oh! trois voix! rien que trois!
    --Mais �crasons d'abord ce ramas qui conspire,
    Et nous verrons apr�s � qui sera l'empire.

_Il compte sur ses doigts et frappe du pied_.
    Toujours trois voix de moins! Ah! ce sont eux qui l'ont!
    --Ce Corneille Agrippa pourtant en sait bien long[22]!
    Dans l'oc�an c�leste il a vu treize �toiles
    Vers la mienne du nord venir � pleines voiles.
    J'aurai l'empire, allons!--Mais d'autre part on dit
    Que l'abb� Jean Trith�me[23] � Fran�ois l'a pr�dit.
    --J'aurais d�, pour mieux voir ma fortune �claircie,
    Avec quelque armement aider la proph�tie!
    Toutes pr�dictions du sorcier le plus fin
    Viennent bien mieux � terme et font meilleure fin
    Quand une bonne arm�e, avec canons et piques,
    Gens de pied, de cheval, fanfares et musiques,
    Pr�te � montrer la route au sort qui veut broncher,
    Leur sert de sage-femme et les fait accoucher.
    Lequel vaut mieux, Corneille Agrippa? Jean Trith�me?
    Celui dont une arm�e explique le syst�me,
    Qui met un fer de lance au bout de ce qu'il dit,
    Et compte maint soudard, lansquenet ou bandit,
    Dont l'estoc, refaisant la fortune imparfaite,
    Taille l'�v�nement au plaisir du proph�te.
    --Pauvres fous! qui, l'oeil fier, le front haut, visent droit
    A l'empire du monde et disent: J'ai mon droit!
    Ils ont force canons, rang�s en longues files,
    Dont le souffle embras� ferait fondre des villes;
    Ils ont vaisseaux, soldats, chevaux, et vous croyez
    Qu'ils vont marcher au but sur les peuples broy�s...
    Baste! au grand carrefour de la fortune humaine,
    Qui mieux encor qu'au tr�ne � l'abime nous m�ne,
    A peine ils font trois pas, qu'ind�cis, incertains,
    T�chant en vain de lire au livre des destins,
    Ils h�sitent, peu s�rs d'eux-m�me, et dans le doute
    Au n�croman du coin vont demander leur route!

_A don Ricardo_.
    --Va-t'en. C'est l'heure o� vont venir les conjur�s.
    Ah! la clef du tombeau?

DON RICARDO (_remettant une clef au roi_).
    Seigneur, vous songerez
    Au comte de Limbourg[24], gardien capitulaire[25],
    Qui me l'a confi�e et fait tout pour vous plaire.

DON CARLOS (_le cong�diant_).
    Fais tout ce que j'ai dit! tout!

DON RICARDO (_s'inclinant_).
    J'y vais de ce pas,
    Altesse!

DON CARLOS.
    Il faut trois coups de canon, n'est-ce pas?

_Don Ricardo s'incline et sort. Don Carlos, rest� seul, tombe dans
une profonde r�verie. Ses bras se croisent, sa t�te fl�chit sur sa
poitrine; puis il se rel�ve et se tourne vers le tombeau_.




SC�NE II.[26]


DON CARLOS (_seul_).
    Charlemagne, pardon! ces vo�tes solitaires
    Ne devraient r�p�ter que paroles aust�res.
    Tu t'indignes sans doute � ce bourdonnement
    Que nos ambitions font sur ton monument.
    --Charlemagne est ici! Comment, s�pulcre sombre,
    Peux-tu sans �clater contenir si grande ombre?
    Es-tu bien l�, g�ant d'un monde cr�ateur[27],
    Et t'y peux-tu coucher de toute ta hauteur?
    --Ah! c'est un beau spectacle � ravir la pens�e
    Que l'Europe ainsi faite et comme il l'a laiss�e!
    Un �difice, avec deux hommes au sommet,
    Deux chefs �lus auxquels tout roi n� se soumet.
    Presque tous les �tats, duch�s, fiefs militaires,
    Royaumes, marquisats, tous sont h�r�ditaires;
    Mais le peuple a parfois son pape ou son c�sar,
    Tout marche, et le hasard corrige le hasard[28].
    De l� vient l'�quilibre, et toujours l'ordre �clate[29].
    �lecteurs de drap d'or, cardinaux d'�carlate,
    Double s�nat sacr� dont la terre s'�meut,
    Ne sont l� qu'en parade, et Dieu veut ce qu'il veut.
    Qu'une id�e, au besoin des temps, un jour �close[30],
    Elle grandit, va, court, se m�le � toute chose,
    Se fait homme[31], saisit les coeurs, creuse un sillon;
    Maint roi la foule au pied ou lui met un b�illon;
    Mais qu'elle entre un matin � la di�te[32], au conclave,
    Et tous les rois soudain verront l'id�e esclave,
    Sur leurs t�tes de rois que ses pieds courberont,
    Surgir, le globe en main ou la tiare au front[33].
    Le pape et l'empereur sont tout. Rien n'est sur terre
    Que pour eux et par eux. Un supr�me myst�re
    Vit en eux, et le ciel, dont ils ont tous les droits,
    Leur fait un grand festin des peuples et des rois,
    Et les tient sous sa nue, o� son tonnerre gronde,
    Seuls, assis � la table o� Dieu leur sert le monde.
    T�te � t�te ils sont l�, r�glant et retranchant,
    Arrangeant l'univers comme un faucheur son champ.
    Tout se passe entre eux deux. Les rois sont � la porte,
    Respirant la vapeur des mets que l'on apporte,
    Regardant � la vitre, attentifs, ennuy�s,
    Et se haussant, pour voir, sur la pointe des pieds.
    Le monde au-dessous d'eux s'�chelonne et se groupe.
    Ils font et d�font. L'un d�lie et l'autre coupe.
    L'un est la v�rit�, l'autre est la force. Ils ont
    Leur raison en eux-m�me, et sont parce qu'ils sont.
    Quand ils sortent, tous deux �gaux, du sanctuaire,
    L'un dans sa pourpre, et l'autre avec son blanc suaire[34],
    L'univers �bloui contemple avec terreur
    Ces deux moiti�s de Dieu, le pape et l'empereur.
    --L'empereur! l'empereur! �tre empereur!--O rage,
    Ne pas l'�tre! et sentir son coeur plein de courage!--
    Qu'il fut heureux celui qui dort dans ce tombeau!
    Qu'il fut grand! De son temps c'�tait encor plus beau.
    Le pape et l'empereur! ce n'�tait plus deux hommes.
    Pierre et C�sar! en eux accouplant les deux Romes[35],
    F�condant l'une et l'autre en un mystique hymen,
    Redonnant une forme, une �me au genre humain,
    Faisant refondre en bloc peuples et p�le-m�le
    Royaumes, pour en faire une Europe nouvelle,
    Et tous deux remettant au moule de leur main
    Le bronze qui restait du vieux monde romain!
    Oh! quel destin!--Pourtant cette tombe est la sienne!
    Tout est-il donc si peu que ce soit l� qu'on vienne?
    Quoi donc! avoir �t� prince, empereur et roi!
    Avoir �t� l'�p�e, avoir �t� la loi!
    G�ant, pour pi�destal avoir eu l'Allemagne!
    Quoi! pour titre c�sar et pour nom Charlemagne!
    Avoir �t� plus grand qu'Annibal, qu'Attila,
    Aussi grand que le monde!... et que tout tienne l�!
    Ah! briguez donc l'empire, et voyez la poussi�re
    Que fait un empereur! Couvrez la terre enti�re
    De bruit et de tumulte; �levez, b�tissez
    Votre empire, et jamais ne dites: C'est assez!
    Taillez � larges pans[36] un �difice immense!
    Savez-vous ce qu'un jour il en reste? � d�mence!
    Cette pierre! Et du titre et du nom triomphants?
    Quelques lettres � faire �peler des enfants!
    Si haut que soit le but o� votre orgueil aspire,
    Voil� le dernier terme!...-Oh! l'empire! l'empire!
    Que m'importe! j'y touche, et le trouve � mon gr�.
    Quelque chose me dit: Tu l'auras!--Je l'aurai--
    Si je l'avais!...--O ciel! �tre ce qui commence!
    Seul, debout, au plus haut de la spirale immense!
    D'une foule d'�tats l'un sur l'autre �tag�s
    �tre la clef de vo�te[37], et voir sous soi rang�s
    Les rois, et sur leur t�te essuyer ses sandales;
    Voir au-dessous des rois les maisons f�odales,
    Margraves, cardinaux, doges, ducs � fleurons[38];
    Puis �v�ques, abb�s, chefs de clans, hauts barons,
    Puis clercs et soldats; puis, loin du fa�te o� nous sommes,
    Dans l'ombre, tout au fond de l'ab�me,--les hommes.
    --Les hommes! c'est-�-dire une foule, une mer,
    Un grand bruit, pleurs et cris, parfois un rire amer,
    Plainte qui, r�veillant la terre qui s'effare,
    A travers tant d'�chos nous arrive fanfare[39]!
    Les hommes!--Des cit�s, des tours, un vaste essaim,
    De hauts clochers d'�glise � sonner le tocsin!--

_R�vant_.
    Base de nations portant sur leurs �paules[40]
    La pyramide �norme appuy�e aux deux p�les,
    Flots vivants, qui toujours l'�treignant[41] de leurs plis,
    La balancent, branlante, � leur vaste roulis,
    Font tout changer de place et, sur ses hautes zones[42],
    Comme des escabeaux font chanceler les tr�nes,
    Si bien que tous les rois, cessant leurs vains d�bats,
    L�vent les yeux au ciel... Rois! regardez en bas!
    --Ah! le peuple!--oc�an!--onde sans cesse �mue,
    O� l'on ne jette rien sans que tout ne remue!
    Vague qui broie un tr�ne et qui berce un tombeau!
    Miroir o� rarement un roi se voit en beau!
    Ah! si l'on regardait parfois dans ce flot sombre,
    On y verrait au fond des empires[43] sans nombre,
    Grands vaisseaux naufrag�s, que son flux[44] et reflux
    Roule, et qui le g�naient, et qu'il[45] ne conna�t plus!
    --Gouverner tout cela!--Monter, si l'on vous nomme,
    A ce fa�te! Y monter, sachant qu'on n'est qu'un homme!
    Avoir l'ab�me l�!...--Pourvu qu'en ce moment
    Il n'aille pas me prendre[46] un �blouissement!
    Oh! d'�tats et de rois mouvante pyramide,
    Ton fa�te est bien �troit! Malheur au pied timide!
    A qui me retiendrais-je! Oh! si j'allais faillir
    En sentant sous mes pieds le monde tressaillir!
    En sentant vivre, sourdre et palpiter la terre!
    --Puis, quand j'aurai ce globe entre mes mains, qu'en faire?
    Le pourrai-je porter seulement[47]? Qu'ai-je en moi?
    �tre empereur, mon Dieu! J'avais trop d'�tre roi!
    Certe, il n'est qu'un mortel de race peu commune
    Dont puisse s'�largir l'�me avec la fortune.
    Mais moi! qui me fera grand? qui sera ma loi?
    Qui me conseillera?

_Il tombe � deux genoux devant le tombeau_.
    Charlemagne! c'est toi!
    Ah! puisque Dieu, pour qui tout obstacle s'efface,
    Prend nos deux majest�s et les met face � face,
    Verse-moi dans le coeur, du fond de ce tombeau,
    Quelque chose de grand, de sublime et de beau!
    Oh! par tous ses c�t�s fais-moi voir toute chose.
    Montre-moi que le monde est petit, car je n'ose
    Y toucher. Montre-moi que sur cette Babel
    Qui du p�tre � C�sar va montant jusqu'au ciel,
    Chacun en son degr� se compla�t et s'admire,
    Voit l'autre par-dessous et se retient d'en rire.
    Apprends-moi tes secrets de vaincre et de r�gner,
    Et dis-moi qu'il vaut mieux punir que pardonner!
    --N'est-ce pas?--S'il est vrai qu'en son lit solitaire
    Parfois une grande ombre au bruit que fait la terre
    S'�veille, et que soudain son tombeau large et clair
    S'entr'ouvre, et dans la nuit jette au monde un �clair,
    Si cette chose est vraie, empereur d'Allemagne,
    Oh! dis-moi ce qu'on peut faire apr�s Charlemagne!
    Parle! d�t en parlant[48] ton souffle souverain
    Me briser sur le front cette porte d'airain!
    Ou plut�t, laisse-moi seul dans ton sanctuaire
    Entrer, laisse-moi voir ta face mortuaire,
    Ne me repousse pas d'un souffle d'aquilons.
    Sur ton chevet de pierre accoude-toi. Parlons.
    Oui, dusses-tu me dire[49], avec ta voix fatale,
    De ces choses qui font l'oeil sombre et le front p�le!
    Parle, et n'aveugle pas ton fils �pouvant�,
    Car ta tombe sans doute est pleine de clart�!
    Ou, si tu ne dis rien, laisse en ta paix profonde
    Carlos �tudier ta t�te comme un monde;
    Laisse qu'il te mesure � loisir, � g�ant.
    Car rien n'est ici-bas si grand que ton n�ant!
    Que la cendre, � d�faut de l'ombre, me conseille!

_Il approche la clef de la serrure_.
    Entrons.

_Il recule_.
    Dieu! s'il allait me parler � l'oreille!
    S'il �tait l�, debout et marchant � pas lents!
    Si j'allais ressortir avec de cheveux blancs!
    Entrons toujours!

_Bruit de pas_.
    On vient. Qui donc ose � cette heure,
    Hors moi, d'un pareil mort �veiller la demeure?
    Qui donc?

_Le bruit s'approche_.
    Ah! j'oubliais! ce sont mes assassins.
    Entrons!

_Il ouvre la porte du tombeau, qu'il referme sur lui.--Entrent
plusieurs hommes, marchant � pas sourds, cach�s sous leurs manteaux
et leurs chapeaux_.




SC�NE III.


LES CONJUR�S. _Ils vont les uns aux autres, en se prenant la main et
en �changeant quelques paroles � voix basse_.

PREMIER CONJUR� (_portant seul une torche allum�e_).
    _Ad augusta_.

DEUXI�ME CONJUR�.
    _Per angusta_.

PREMIER CONJUR�.
    Les saints
    Nous prot�gent.

TROISI�ME CONJUR�.
    Les morts nous servent.

PREMIER CONJUR�.
    Dieu nous garde.

_Bruit de pas dans l'ombre_.

DEUXI�ME CONJUR�.
    Qui vive[50]?

VOIX DANS L'OMBRE.
    _Ad augusta_.

DEUXI�ME CONJUR�.
    _Per angusta_.

_Entrent de nouveaux conjur�s.--Bruit de pas_.

PREMIER CONJUR� (_au troisi�me_).
    Regarde;
    Il vient encor quelqu'un.

TROISI�ME CONJUR�.
    Qui vive?

VOIX DANS L'OMBRE.
    _Ad augusta_.

TROISI�ME CONJUR�.
    _Per augusta_.

_Entrent de nouveaux conjur�s, qui �changent des signes de mains avec
tous les autres_.

PREMIER CONJUR�.
    C'est bien. Nous voil� tous.--Gotha,
    Fais le rapport.--Amis, l'ombre attend la lumi�re.

_Tous les conjur�s s'asseyent en demi-cercle sur des tombeaux. Le
premier conjur� passe tour � tour devant tous, et chacun allume � sa
torche une cire qu'il tient � la main. Puis le premier conjur� va
s'asseoir en silence sur une tombe au centre du cercle et plus haute
que les autres_.

LE DUC DE GOTHA (_se levant_).
    Amis, Charles d'Espagne, �tranger par sa m�re[51],
    Pr�tend au saint-empire.

PREMIER CONJUR�.
    Il aura le tombeau.

LE DUC DE GOTHA (_Il jette sa torche � terre et l'�crase du pied_).
    Qu'il en soit de son front comme de ce flambeau!

TOUS.
    Que ce soit!

PREMIER CONJUR�.
    Mort � lui!

LE DUC DE GOTHA.
    Qu'il meure!

TOUS.
    Qu'on l'immole!

DON JUAN DE HARO.
    Son p�re est allemand.

LE DUC DE LUTZELBOURG.
    Sa m�re est espagnole.

LE DUC DE GOTHA.
    Il n'est plus espagnol et n'est pas allemand.
    Mort!

UN CONJUR�.
    Si les �lecteurs allaient en ce moment
    Le nommer empereur?

PREMIER CONJUR�.
    Eux! lui! jamais!

DON GIL TELLEZ GIRON.
    Qu'importe!
    Amis! frappons la t�te et la couronne est morte!

PREMIER CONJUR�,
    S'il a le saint-empire, il devient, quel qu'il soit,
    Tr�s auguste, et Dieu seul peut le toucher du doigt!

LE DUC DE GOTHA.
    Le plus s�r, c'est qu'avant d'�tre auguste, il expire.

PREMIER CONJUR�.
    On ne l'�lira point!

TOUS.
    Il n'aura pas l'empire!

PREMIER CONJUR�.
    Combien faut-il de bras pour le mettre au linceul?

TOUS.
    Un seul.

PREMIER CONJUR�.
    Combien faut-il de coups au coeur?

TOUS.
    Un seul.

PREMIER CONJUR�.
    Qui frappera?

TOUS.
    Nous tous.

PREMIER CONJUR�.
    La victime est un tra�tre.
    Ils font un empereur; nous, faisons un grand pr�tre.
    Tirons au sort.

_Tous les conjur�s �crivent leurs noms sur leurs tablettes, d�chirent
la feuille, la roulent, et vont l'un apr�s l'autre la jeter dans
l'urne d'un tombeau.--Puis le premier conjur� dit_:
    Prions.

_Tous s'agenouillent. Le premier conjur� se l�ve et dit_:
    Que l'�lu croie en Dieu,
    Frappe comme un Romain, meure comme un H�breu[52]!
    Il faut qu'il brave roue et tenailles mordantes[53],
    Qu'il chante aux chevalets[54], rie aux lampes ardentes[55],
    Enfin que pour tuer et mourir, r�sign�,
    Il fasse tout!

_Il tire un des parchemins de l'urne_.

TOUS.
    Quel nom?

PREMIER CONJUR� (_� haute voix_).
    Hernani.

HERNANI (_sortant de la foule des conjur�s_).
    J'ai gagn�!
    --Je te tiens, toi que j'ai si longtemps poursuivie,
    Vengeance!

DON RUY GOMEZ (_per�ant la foule et prenant Hernani � part_).
    Oh! c�de-moi ce coup!

HERNANI.
    Non, sur ma vie!
    Oh! ne m'enviez pas ma fortune, seigneur!
    C'est la premi�re fois qu'il m'arrive bonheur.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Tu n'as rien. Eh bien, tout, fiefs, ch�teaux, vasselages,
    Cent mille paysans dans mes trois cents villages,
    Pour ce coup � frapper, je te les donne, ami!

HERNANI.
    Non!

LE DUC DE GOTHA.
    Ton bras porterait un coup moins affermi,
    Vieillard!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Arri�re, vous! sinon le bras, j'ai l'�me.
    Aux rouilles du fourreau ne jugez point la lame.

_A Hernani_.
    Tu m'appartiens!

HERNANI.
    Ma vie � vous, la sienne � moi.

DON RUY GOMEZ (_tirant le cor de sa ceinture_).
    Eh bien, �coute, ami. Je te rends ce cor[56].

HERNANI (_�branl�_).
    Quoi!
    La vie!--Eh! que m'importe!	Ah! je tiens ma vengeance!
    Avec Dieu dans ceci je suis d'intelligence[57].
    J'ai mon p�re � venger... peut-�tre plus encor!
    Elle, me la rends-tu?

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Jamais! Je rends ce cor.

HERNANI.
    Non!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    R�fl�chis, enfant!

HERNANI.
    Duc, laisse-moi ma proie.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Eh bien! maudit sois-tu de m'�ter cette joie!

_Il remet le cor � sa ceinture_.

PREMIER CONJUR� (_� Hernani_).
    Fr�re! avant qu'on ait pu l'�lire, il serait bien
    D'attendre d�s ce soir[58] Carlos...

HERNANI.
    Ne craignez rien
    Je sais comment on pousse un homme dans la tombe.

PREMIER CONJUR�.
    Que toute trahison sur le tra�tre[59] retombe,
    Et Dieu soit avec vous!--Nous, comtes et barons,
    S'il p�rit[60] sans tuer, continuons! Jurons
    De frapper tour � tour et sans nous y soustraire[61]
    Carlos qui doit mourir.

TOUS (_tirant leurs �p�es_).
    Jurons!

LE DUC DE GOTHA (au premier conjur�).
    Sur quoi, mon fr�re?

DON RUY GOMEZ (_retourne son �p�e, la prend par la pointe et l'�l�ve
au-dessus de sa t�te_).
    Jurons sur cette croix[62]!

TOUS (_�levant leurs �p�es_).
    Qu'il meure imp�nitent!

_On entend un coup de canon �loign�. Tous s'arr�tent en silence.--La
porte du tombeau s'entr'ouvre. Don Carlos parait sur le seuil. P�le,
il �coute.--Un second coup.--Un troisi�me coup.--Il ouvre tout � fait
la porte du tombeau, mais sans faire un pas, debout et immobile sur
le seuil_.




SCENE IV.

LES CONJUR�S, DON CARLOS: _puis_ DON RICARDO, SEIGNEURS, GARDES; LE
ROI DE BOH�ME, LE DUC DE BAVI�RE; _puis_ DO�A SOL.


DON CARLOS.
    Messieurs, allez plus loin! l'empereur vous entend.

_Tous les flambeaux s'�teignent � la fois.--Profond silence.--Il fait
un pas dans les t�n�bres, si �paisses qu'on y distingue � peine les
conjur�s, muets et immobiles_.
    Silence et nuit! l'essaim en sort et s'y replonge.
    Croyez-vous que ceci va passer comme un songe,
    Et que je vous prendrai, n'ayant plus vos flambeaux,
    Pour des hommes de pierre assis sur leurs tombeaux?
    Vous parliez tout � l'heure assez haut, mes statues!
    Allons! relevez donc vos t�tes abattues,
    Car voici Charles-Quint! Frappez, faites un pas!
    Voyons, oserez-vous?--Non, vous n'oserez pas.
    Vos torches flamboyaient sanglantes sous ces vo�tes.
    Mon souffle a donc suffi pour les �teindre toutes!
    Mais voyez, et tournez vos yeux irr�solus,
    Si j'en �teins beaucoup, j'en allume encor plus.

_Il frappe de la clef de fer sur la porte de bronze du tombeau. A ce
bruit, toutes les profondeurs du souterrain se remplissent de soldats
portant des torches et des pertuisanes. A leur t�te, le duc d'Alcala,
le marquis d'Almu�an_.
    Accourez, mes faucons! j'ai le nid, j'ai la proie!

_Aux conjur�s_.
    J'illumine � mon tour. Le s�pulcre flamboie,
    Regardez!

_Aux soldats_.
    Venez tous, car le crime est flagrant.

HERNANI (_regardant les soldats_).
    A la bonne heure! Seul il me semblait trop grand.
    C'est bien. J'ai cru d'abord que c'�tait Charlemagne.
    Ce n'est que Charles-Quint.

DON CARLOS (_au duc d'Alcala_).
    Conn�table d'Espagne[63]!

_Au marquis d'Almu�an_.
    Amiral de Castille, ici!--D�sarmez-les.

_On entoure les conjur�s et on les d�sarme_.

DON RICARDO (_accourant et s'inclinant jusqu'� terre_).
    Majest�[64]!

DON CARLOS.
    Je te fais alcade du palais[65].

DON RICARDO (_s'inclinant de nouveau_).
    Deux �lecteurs[66], au nom de la chambre dor�e[67],
    Viennent complimenter la majest� sacr�e.

DON CARLOS.
    Qu'ils entrent.

_Bas � Ricardo_.
    Do�a Sol.

_Ricardo salue et sort. Entrent, avec flambeaux et fanfares, le roi
de Boh�me et le duc de Bavi�re, tout en drap d'or, couronnes en
t�te.--Nombreux cort�ge de seigneurs allemands, portant la banni�re
de l'empire, l'aigle � deux t�tes, avec l'�cusson d'Espagne au
milieu--Les soldats s'�cartent, se rangent en haie, et font passage
aux deux �lecteurs, jusqu'� l'empereur, qu'ils saluent profond�ment,
et qui leur rend leur salut en soulevant son chapeau_.

LE DUC DE BAVI�RE.
    Charles! roi des Romains[68],
    Majest� tr�s sacr�e, empereur! dans vos mains
    Le monde est maintenant, car vous avez l'empire.
    Il est � vous, ce tr�ne o� tout monarque aspire!
    Fr�d�ric, duc de Saxe, y fut d'abord �lu,
    Mais, vous jugeant plus digne, il n'en a pas voulu.
    Venez donc recevoir la couronne et le globe.
    Le saint-empire, � roi, vous rev�t de la robe,
    Il vous arme du glaive, et vous �tes tr�s grand.

DON CARLOS.
    J'irai remercier le coll�ge en rentrant.
    Allez, messieurs. Merci, mon fr�re de Boh�me[69],
    Mon cousin de Bavi�re. Allez. J'irai moi-m�me.

LE ROI DE BOHEME.
    Charles, du nom d'amis nos a�eux se nommaient.
    Mon p�re aimait ton p�re, et leurs p�res s'aimaient.
    Charles, si jeune en butte aux fortunes contraires,
    Dis, veux-tu que je sois ton fr�re entre tes fr�res?
    Je t'ai vu tout enfant, et ne puis oublier...

DON CARLOS (_l'interrompant_).
    Roi de Boh�me! eh bien, vous �tes familier[70]!

_Il lui pr�sente sa main � baiser, ainsi qu'au duc de Bavi�re, puis
cong�die les deux �lecteurs, qui le saluent profond�ment_.
    Allez!

_Sortent les deux �lecteurs avec leur cort�ge_.

LA FOULE.
    Vivat!

DON CARLOS _(� part_).
    J'y suis[71]! et tout m'a fait passage!
    Empereur!--Au refus de Fr�d�ric le Sage!

_Entre do�a Sol, conduite par Ricardo_.

DO�A SOL.
    Des soldats! l'empereur! O ciel! coup impr�vu.
    Hernani!

HERNANI.
    Do�a Sol!

DON RUY GOMEZ (� c�t� d'Hernani, � part).
    Elle ne m'a point vu!

_Do�a Sol court � Hernani. Il la fait reculer d'un regard de
d�fiance_.

HERNANI.
    Madame!...

DO�A SOL (_tirant le poignard de son sein_).
    J'ai toujours son poignard[72]!

HERNANI (_lui tendant les bras_).
    Mon amie!

DON CARLOS.
    Silence, tous!

_Aux conjur�s_.
    Votre �me est-elle raffermie?
    Il convient que je donne au monde une le�on.
    Lara le Castillan et Gotha le Saxon,
    Vous tous! que venait-on faire ici? parlez.

HERNANI (_faisant un pas_).
    Sire,
    La chose est toute simple, et l'on peut vous la dire.
    Nous gravions la sentence au mur de Balthazar[73].

_Il tire un poignard et l'agite_.
    Nous rendions � C�sar ce qu'on doit � C�sar.

DON CARLOS.
    Paix!

_A don Ruy Gomez_.
    Vous tra�tre, Silva!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Lequel de nous deux, sire?

HERNANI (_se retournant vers les conjur�s_).
    Nos t�tes et l'empire! il a ce qu'il d�sire.

_A l'empereur_.
    Le bleu manteau des rois pouvait g�ner vos pas.
    La pourpre vous va mieux. Le sang n'y para�t pas.

DON CARLOS (_� don Ruy Gomez_).
    Mon cousin de Silva, c'est une f�lonie
    A faire du blason rayer ta baronnie!
    C'est haute trahison, don Ruy, songez-y bien.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Les rois Rodrigue font les comtes Julien[74].

DON CARLOS (_au duc d'Alcala_).
    Ne prenez que ce qui peut �tre duc ou comte.
    Le reste!...

_Don Ruy Gomez, le duc de Lutzelbourg, le duc de Gotha, don Juan de
Haro, don Guzman de Lara, don Tellez Giron, le baron de Hohenbourg, se
s�parent du groupe des conjur�s, parmi lesquels est rest� Hernani.--Le
duc d'Alcala les entoure �troitement de gardes_.

DO�A SOL (� part).
    Il est sauv�!

HERNANI (_sortant du groupe des conjur�s_).
    Je pr�tends qu'on me compte!

_A don Carlos_.
    Puisqu'il s'agit de hache ici, que Hernani,
    P�tre obscur, sous tes pieds passerait impuni,
    Puisque son front n'est plus au niveau de ton glaive,
    Puisqu'il faut �tre grand pour mourir, je me l�ve.
    Dieu qui donne le sceptre et qui te le donna
    M'a fait duc de Segorbe[75] et duc de Cardona[76],
    Marquis de Monroy[77], comte Albatera[78], vicomte
    De Gor[79], seigneur de lieux dont j'ignore le compte.
    Je suis Jean d'Aragon, grand ma�tre d'Avis[80], n�
    Dans l'exil, fils proscrit d'un p�re assassin�
    Par sentence du tien, roi Carlos de Castille!
    Le meurtre est entre nous affaire de famille.
    Vous avez l'�chafaud, nous avons le poignard.
    Donc, le ciel m'a fait duc, et l'exil montagnard.
    Mais puisque j'ai sans fruit aiguis� mon �p�e
    Sur les monts et dans l'eau des torrents retremp�e,

_Il met son chapeau. Aux autres conjur�s_:
    Couvrons-nous, grands d'Espagne!

_Tous les Espagnols se couvrent. A don Carlos_:
    Oui, nos t�tes, � roi,
    Ont le droit de tomber couvertes devant toi!

_Aux prisonniers_.
    Silva, Haro, Lara, gens de titre et de race,
    Place � Jean d'Aragon! ducs et comtes, ma place!

_Aux courtisans et aux gardes_.
    Je suis Jean d'Aragon, roi, bourreaux et valets!
    Et si vos �chafauds sont petits, changez-les!

_Il vient se joindre au groupe des seigneurs prisonniers_.

DO�A SOL.
    Ciel!

DON CARLOS.
    En effet, j'avais oubli� cette histoire.

HERNANI.
    Celui dont le flanc saigne a meilleure m�moire.
    L'affront que l'offenseur oublie en insens�
    Vit et toujours remue au coeur de l'offens�.

DON CARLOS.
    Donc je suis, c'est un titre � n'en point vouloir d'autres,
    Fils de p�res qui font choir la t�te des v�tres!

DO�A SOL (_se jetant � genoux devant l'empereur_).
    Sire, pardon! piti�! Sire, soyez cl�ment!
    Ou frappez-nous tous deux, car il est mon amant,
    Mon �poux! En lui seul je respire. Oh! je tremble.
    Sire, ayez la piti� de nous tuer ensemble!
    Majest�! je me tra�ne � vos sacr�s genoux!
    Je l'aime!  Il est � moi, comme l'empire � vous!
    Oh! gr�ce!

_Don Carlos la regarde immobile_.
    Quel penser[81] sinistre vous absorbe?

DON CARLOS.
    Allons! relevez-vous, duchesse de Segorbe,
    Comtesse Albatera, marquise de Monroy...

_A Hernani_.
    Tes autres noms, don Juan?

HERNANI.
    Qui parle ainsi? le roi?

DON CARLOS.
    Non, l'empereur.

DO�A SOL (_se relevant_),
    Grand Dieu!

DON CARLOS (_la montrant � Hernani_).
    Duc, voil� ton �pouse.

HERNANI (_les yeux au ciel, et do�a Sol dans ses bras_).
    Juste Dieu!

DON CARLOS (_� don Ruy Gomez_).
    Mon cousin, ta noblesse est jalouse,
    Je sais. Mais Aragon peut �pouser Silva.

DON RUY GOMEZ (_sombre_).
    Ce n'est pas ma noblesse.

HERNANI (_regardant do�a Sol avec amour et la tenant embrass�e_).
    Oh! ma haine s'en va!

_Il jette son poignard_.

DON RUY GOMEZ (_� part, les regardant tous deux_).
    �claterai-je? oh! non! Fol amour! douleur folle!
    Tu leur ferais piti�, vieille t�te espagnole!
    Vieillard, br�le sans flamme, aime et souffre en secret.
    Laisse ronger ton coeur. Pas un cri. L'on rirait.

DO�A SOL (_dans les bras d'Hernani_).
    0 mon duc!

HERNANI.
    Je n'ai plus que de l'amour dans l'�me.

DO�A SOL.
    O bonheur!

DON CARLOS (_� part, la main dans sa poitrine_).
    �teins-toi, coeur jeune et plein de flamme!
    Laisse r�gner l'esprit[82], que longtemps tu troublas.
    Tes amours d�sormais, tes ma�tresses, h�las!
    C'est l'Allemagne, c'est la Flandre, c'est l'Espagne.

_L'oeil fix� sur sa banni�re_.
    L'empereur est pareil � l'aigle, sa compagne.
    A la place du coeur il n'a qu'un �cusson[83].

HERNANI.
    Ah! vous �tes C�sar!

DON CARLOS (_� Hernani_).
    De ta noble maison,
    Don juan, ton coeur est digne.

_Montrant do�a Sol_.
    Il est digne aussi d'elle.
    --A genoux, duc!

_Hernani s'agenouille. Don Carlos d�tache sa toison-d'or et la lui
passe au cou_.
    Re�ois ce collier.

_Don Carlos tire son �p�e et l'en frappe trois fois sur l'�paule_.
    Sois fid�le!
    Par saint Etienne[84], duc, je te fais chevalier.

_Il le rel�ve et l'embrasse_.
    Mais tu l'as, le plus doux et le plus beau collier,
    Celui que je n'ai pas, qui manque au rang supr�me,
    Les deux bras d'une femme aim�e et qui vous aime!
    Ah! tu vas �tre heureux; moi, je suis empereur.

_Aux conjur�s_.
    Je ne sais plus vos noms, messieurs. Haine et fureur,
    Je veux tout oublier. Allez, je vous pardonne!
    C'est la le�on qu'au monde il convient que je donne,
    Ce n'est pas vainement qu'� Charles premier, roi,
    L'empereur Charles-Quint succ�de, et qu'une loi
    Change, aux yeux de l'Europe, orpheline �plor�e,
    L'altesse catholique en majest� sacr�e.

_Les conjur�s tombent � genoux_.

LES CONJUR�S.
    Gloire � Carlos!

DON RUY GOMEZ (_� don Carlos_).
    Moi seul je reste condamn�.

DON CARLOS.
    Et moi!

DON RUY GOMEZ (_� part_).
    Mais, comme lui, je n'ai point pardonn�!

HERNANI.
    Qui donc nous change tous ainsi?

TOUS (_soldats, conjur�s, seigneurs_).
    Vive Allemagne!
    Honneur � Charles-Quint!

DON CARLOS (_se tournant vers le tombeau_).
    Honneur � Charlemagne!
    Laissez-nous seuls tous deux.

_Tous sortent_.




SC�NE V.


DON CARLOS (_seul. _Il s'incline devant le tombeau_).
    Es-tu content de moi?
    Ai-je bien d�pouill� les mis�res du roi[85],
    Charlemagne? Empereur, suis-je bien un autre homme?
    Puis-je accoupler mon casque � la mitre de Rome?
    Aux fortunes du monde ai-je droit de toucher?
    Ai-je un pied s�r et ferme, et qui puisse marcher
    Dans ce sentier, sem� des ruines vandales,
    Que tu nous as battu de tes larges sandales?
    Ai-je bien � ta flamme allum� mon flambeau?
    Ai-je compris la voix qui parle en ton tombeau?
    --Ah! j'�tais seul, perdu, seul devant un empire,
    Tout un monde qui hurle, et menace, et conspire,
    Le Danois � punir[86], le Saint-P�re[87] � payer,
    Venise[88], Soliman[89], Luther, Fran�ois premier,
    Mille poignards jaloux luisant d�j� dans l'ombre,
    Des pi�ges, des �cueils, des ennemis sans nombre,
    Vingt peuples dont un seul ferait peur � vingt rois,
    Tout press�, tout pressant, tout � faire � la fois,
    Je t'ai cri�:--Par o� faut-il que je commence?
    Et tu m'as r�pondu:--Mon fils, par la cl�mence!




ACTE CINQUI�ME - LA NOCE.


SARAGOSSE.

_Une terrasse du palais d'Aragon. Au fond, la rampe d'un escalier qui
s'enfonce dans le jardin. A droite et � gauche, deux portes donnant
sur une terrasse, que ferme une balustrade surmont�e de deux rangs
d'arcades moresques, au-dessus et au travers desquelles on voit les
jardins du palais, les jets d'eau dans l'ombre, les bosquets avec les
lumi�res qui s'y prom�nent, et au fond les fa�tes gothiques et arabes
du palais illumin�. Il est nuit. On entend des fanfares �loign�es. Des
masques, des dominos, �pars, isol�s, ou group�s, traversent �� et l�
la terrasse. Sur le devant, un groupe de jeunes seigneurs, les masques
� la main, riant et causant � grand bruit_.




SC�NE PREMI�RE.

DON SANCHO SANCHEZ DE ZUNIGA, Comte de MONTEREY, DON MATIAS CENTURION,
MARQUIS D'ALMURAN, DON RICARDO DE ROXAS, Comte de CASAPALMA, DON
FRANCISCO DE SOTOMAYOR, Comte de VELALCAZAR, DON GARCI SUAREZ DE
CARBAJAL, Comte DE PERALVER.


DON GARCI.
    Ma foi, vive la joie et vive l'�pous�e!

DON MATIAS (_regardant au balcon_).
    Saragosse ce soir se met � la crois�e.

DON GARCI.
    Et fait bien! on ne vit jamais noce aux flambeaux
    Plus gaie, et nuit plus douce, et mari�s plus beaux!

DON MATIAS.
    Bon empereur!

DON SANCHO.
    Marquis, certain soir qu'� la brune
    Nous allions avec lui tous deux cherchant fortune[1],
    Qui nous e�t dit qu'un jour tout finirait ainsi?

DON RICARDO (_l'interrompant_).
    J'en �tais.

_Aux autres_.
    �coutez l'histoire que voici:
    Trois galants, un bandit que l'�chafaud r�clame,
    Puis un duc, puis un roi, d'un m�me coeur de femme
    Font le si�ge � la fois. L'assaut donn�, qui l'a?
    C'est le bandit.

DON FRANCISCO.
    Mais rien que de simple en cela.
    L'amour et la fortune, ailleurs comme en Espagne,
    Sont jeux de des pip�s. C'est le voleur qui gagne!

DON RICARDO
    Moi, j'ai fait ma fortune � voir faire l'amour.
    D'abord comte, puis grand, puis alcade de cour,
    J'ai fort bien employ� mon temps, sans qu'on s'en doute.

DON SANCHO.
    Le secret de monsieur, c'est d'�tre sur la route
    Du roi...

DON RICARDO.
    Faisant valoir mes droits, mes actions.

DON GARCI.
    Vous avez profit� de ses distractions.

DON MATIAS.
    Que devient le vieux duc? Fait-il clouer sa bi�re?

DON SANCHO.
    Marquis, ne riez pas! car c'est une �me fi�re.
    Il aimait do�a Sol, ce vieillard. Soixante ans
    Ont fait ses cheveux gris, un jour les a fait blancs.

DON GARCI.
    Il n'a pas reparu, dit-on, � Saragosse?

DON SANCHO.
    Vouliez-vous pas qu'il m�t son cercueil de la noce[2]?

DON FRANCISCO.
    Et que fait l'empereur?

DON SANCHO.
    L'empereur aujourd'hui
    Est triste. Le Luther lui donne de l'ennui.

DON RICARDO.
    Ce Luther, beau sujet de soucis et d'alarmes!
    Que j'en finirais vite avec quatre gendarmes!

DON MATIAS.
    Le Soliman aussi lui fait ombre[3].

DON GARCI.
    Ah! Luther,
    Soliman, Neptunus, le diable et Jupiter,
    Que me font ces gens-l�? Les femmes sont jolies,
    La mascarade est rare, et j'ai dit cent folies!

DON SANCHO.
    Voil� l'essentiel.

DON RICARDO.
    Garci n'a point tort. Moi,
    Je ne suis plus le m�me un jour de f�te, et croi
    Qu'un masque que je mets me fait une autre t�te,
    En v�rit�!

DON SANCHO (_bas � don Matias_).
    Que n'est-ce alors tous les jours f�te?

DON FRANCISCO (_montrant la porte � droite_).
    Messeigneurs, n'est-ce pas la chambre des �poux?

DON GARCI (_avec un signe de t�te_).
    Nous les verrons venir dans l'instant.

DON FRANCISCO.
    Croyez-vous?

DON GARCI.
    H�! sans doute!

DON FRANCISCO.
    Tant mieux. L'�pous�e est si belle!

DON RICARDO.
    Que l'empereur est bon! Hernani, ce rebelle
    Avoir la toison d'or! mari�! pardonn�!
    Loin de l�, s'il m'e�t cru, l'empereur e�t donn�
    Lit de pierre au galant, lit de plume � la dame.

DON SANCHO (_bas � don Matias_).
    Que je le cr�verais volontiers de ma lame,
    Faux seigneur de clinquant recousu de gros fil.
    Pourpoint de comte, empli de conseils d'alguazil[4]!

DON RICARDO (_s'approchant_).
    Que dites-vous l�?

DON MATIAS (bas � don Sancho).
    Comte, ici pas de querelle!

_A don Ricardo_.
    Il me chante un sonnet de P�trarque � sa belle.

DON GARCI.
    Avez-vous remarqu�, messieurs, parmi les fleurs,
    Les femmes, les habits de toutes les couleurs,
    Ce spectre, qui, debout contre une balustrade,
    De son domino noir tachait la mascarade?

DON RICARDO.
    Oui, pardieu!

DON GARCI.
    Qu'est-ce donc?

DON RICARDO.
    Mais, sa taille, son air...
    C'est don Prancasio, g�n�ral de la mer.

DON FRANCISCO.
    Non.

DON GARCI.
    Il n'a pas quitt� son masque.

DON FRANCISCO.
    Il n'avait garde[5].
    C'est le duc de Soma qui veut qu'on le regarde.
    Rien de plus.

DON RICARDO.
    Non. Le duc m'a parl�.

DON GARCI.
    Qu'est ce alors
    Que ce masque?--Tenez, le voil�.

_Entre un domino noir qui traverse lentement la terrasse au fond. Tous
se retournent et le suivent des yeux, sans qu'il paraisse y prendre
garde_.

DON SANCHO.
    Si les morts
    Marchent, voici leur pas.

DON GARCI (_courant au domino noir_).
    Beau masque!...

_Le domino noir se retourne et s'arr�te. Garci recule_.
    Sur mon �me,
    Messeigneurs, dans ses yeux j'ai vu luire une flamme!

DON SANCHO.
    Si c'est le diable, il trouve � qui parler[6].

_Il va au domino noir, toujours immobile_.
    Mauvais!
    Nous viens-tu de l'enfer?

LE MASQUE.
   Je n'en viens pas, j'y vais.

_Il reprend sa marche et dispara�t par la rampe de l'escalier[7].
Tous le suivent des yeux avec une sorte d'effroi_.

DON MATIAS.
    La voix est s�pulcrale autant qu'on le peut dire.

DON GARCI.
    Baste! ce qui fait peur ailleurs, au bal fait rire.

DON SANCHO.
    Quelque mauvais plaisant[8]!

DON GARCI.
    Ou si c'est Lucifer
    Qui vient nous voir danser, en attendant l'enfer[9],
    Dansons!

DON SANCHO.
    C'est � coup s�r quelque bouffonnerie.

DON MATIAS.
    Nous le saurons demain.

DON SANCHO (_� don Matias_).
    Regardez, je vous prie.
    Que devient-il?

DON MATIAS (_� la balustrade de la terrasse).
    Il a descendu l'escalier.
    Plus rien.

DON SANCHO.
    C'est un plaisant dr�le[10]!

_R�vant_.
    C'est singulier.

DON GARCI (_� une dame qui passe_).
    Marquise, dansons-nous celle-ci[11]?

_Il la salue et lui pr�sente la main_.

LA DAME.
    Mon cher comte,
    Vous savez, avec vous, que mon mari les compte[12].

DON GARCI.
    Raison de plus. Cela l'amuse apparemment.
    C'est son plaisir. Il compte[13], et nous dansons.

_La dame lui donne la main, et ils sortent_.

DON SANCHO (_pensif_).
    Vraiment,
    C'est singulier!

DON MATIAS.
    Voici les mari�s. Silence!

_Entrent Hernani et do�a Sol se donnant la main. Do�a Sol en
magnifique habit de mari�e; Hernani tout en velours noir, avec la
toison-d'or au cou. Derri�re eux, foule de masques, de dames et de
seigneurs qui leur font cort�ge. Deux hallebardiers en riche livr�e
les suivent, et quatre pages les pr�c�dent. Tout le monde se range et
s'incline sur leur passage. Fanfare_.




SCENE II.

LES MEMES, HERNANI, DO�A SOL, SUITE.


HERNANI (_saluant_).
    Chers amis!

DON RICARDO (_allant � lui et s'inclinant_).
    Ton bonheur fait le n�tre, excellence!

DON FRANCISCO (_contemplant do�a Sol_).
    Saint Jacques monseigneur[14]! c'est V�nus qu'il conduit!

DON MATIAS.
    D'honneur, on est heureux un pareil jour la nuit!

DON FRANCISCO (_montrant � don Matias la chambre nuptiale_).
    Qu'il va se passer l� de gracieuses choses!
    �tre f�e, et tout voir, feux �teints, portes closes,
    Serait-ce pas charmant!

DON SANCHO (_� don Matias_).
    Il est tard. Partons-nous?

_Tous vont saluer les mari�s et sortent, les uns par la porte, les
autres par l'escalier du fond_.

HERNANI (_les reconduisant_).
    Dieu vous garde!

DON SANCHO (_rest� le dernier, lui serre la main_).
    Soyez heureux!

_Il sort. Hernani et do�a Sol restent seuls. Bruit de pas et de
voix qui s'�loignent, puis cessent tout � fait. Pendant tout le
commencement de la sc�ne qui suit, les fanfares et les lumi�res
�loign�es s'�teignent par degr�s. La nuit et le silence reviennent
peu � peu_.




SC�NE III.

HERNANI, DO�A SOL.


DO�A SOL.
    Ils s'en vont tous,
    Enfin!

HERNANI (_cherchant � l'attirer dans ses bras_).
    Cher amour!

DO�A SOL (_rougissant et reculant_).
    C'est... qu'il est tard, ce me semble.

HERNANI.
    Ange! il est toujours tard pour �tre seuls ensemble.

DO�A SOL.
    Ce bruit me fatiguait. N'est-ce pas, cher seigneur,
    Que toute cette joie �tourdit le bonheur?

HERNANI.
    Tu dis vrai. Le bonheur, amie[15], est chose grave.
    Il veut des coeurs de bronze et lentement s'y grave.
    Le plaisir l'effarouche en lui jetant des fleurs.
    Son sourire est moins pr�s du rire que des pleurs.

DO�A SOL.
    Dans vos yeux, ce sourire est le jour.

_Hernani cherche � l'entra�ner vers la porte. Elle rougit_.
    Tout � l'heure.

HERNANI.
    Oh! je suis ton esclave! Oui, demeure, demeure!
    Fais ce que tu voudras. Je ne demande rien.
    Tu sais ce que tu fais! ce que tu fais est bien!
    Je rirai si tu veux, je chanterai. Mon �me
    Br�le. Eh! dis au volcan qu'il �touffe sa flamme,
    Le volcan fermera ses gouffres entr'ouverts,
    Et n'aura sur ses flancs que fleurs et gazons verts.
    Car le g�ant est pris, le V�suve est esclave,
    Et que t'importe � toi son coeur rong� de lave?
    Tu veux des fleurs? c'est bien! Il faut que de son mieux
    Le volcan tout br�l� s'�panouisse aux yeux!

DO�A SOL.
    Oh! que vous �tes bon pour une pauvre femme,
    Hernani de mon coeur!

HERNANI.
    Quel est ce nom, madame?
    Ah! ne me nomme plus de ce nom, par piti�!
    Tu me fais souvenir que j'ai tout oubli�!
    Je sais qu'il existait autrefois, dans un r�ve,
    Un Hernani, dont l'oeil avait l'�clair du glaive,
    Un homme de la nuit et des monts, un proscrit
    Sur qui le mot _vengeance_ �tait partout �crit,
    Un malheureux tra�nant apr�s lui l'anath�me!
    Mais je ne connais pas ce Hernani.--Moi, j'aime
    Les pr�s, les fleurs, les bois, le chant du rossignol.
    Je suis Jean d'Aragon, mari de do�a Sol!
    Je suis heureux!

DO�A SOL.
    Je suis heureuse!

HERNANI.
    Que m'importe
    Les haillons qu'en entrant j'ai laiss�s � la porte!
    Voici que je reviens � mon palais en deuil.
    Un ange du Seigneur m'attendait sur le seuil.
    J'entre, et remets debout les colonnes bris�es,
    Je rallume le feu, je rouvre les crois�es,
    Je fais arracher l'herbe au pav� de la cour,
    Je ne suis plus que joie, enchantement, amour.
    Qu'on me rende mes tours, mes donjons, mes bastilles,
    Mon panache, mon si�ge au conseil des Castilles,
    Vienne ma do�a Sol[16] rouge et le front baiss�,
    Qu'on nous laisse[17] tous deux, et le reste est pass�!
    Je n'ai rien vu, rien dit, rien fait. Je recommence
    J'efface tout, j'oublie! Ou sagesse ou d�mence,
    Je vous ai, je vous aime, et vous �tes mon bien!

DO�A SOL (_examinant sa toison-d'or_).
    Que sur ce velours noir ce collier d'or fait bien!

HERNANI.
    Vous v�tes avant moi le roi mis de la sorte[18].

DO�A SOL.
    Je n'ai pas remarqu�. Tout autre, que m'importe!
    Puis, est-ce le velours ou le satin encor?
    Non, mon duc, c'est ton cou qui sied au collier d'or.
    Vous �tes noble et fier, monseigneur.

_Il veut l'entra�ner._
    Tout � l'heure!
    Un moment!--Vois-tu bien, c'est la joie et je pleure!
    Viens voir la belle nuit.

_Elle va � la balustrade_.
    Mon duc, rien qu'un moment!
    Le temps de respirer et de voir seulement.
    Tout s'est �teint, flambeaux et musique de f�te.
    Rien que la nuit et nous. F�licit� parfaite!
    Dis, ne le crois-tu pas? sur nous, tout en dormant,
    La nature � demi veille amoureusement.
    Pas un nuage au ciel. Tout, comme nous, repose.
    Viens, respire avec moi l'air embaum� de rose!
    Regarde. Plus de feux, plus de bruit. Tout se tait.
    La lune tout � l'heure � l'horizon montait
    Tandis que tu parlais, sa lumi�re qui tremble
    Et ta voix, toutes deux m'allaient au coeur ensemble,
    Je me sentais joyeuse et calme, � mon amant,
    Et j'aurais bien voulu mourir en ce moment!

HERNANI.
    Ah! qui n'oublierait tout � cette voix c�leste!
    Ta parole est un chant o� rien d'humain ne reste.
    Et, comme un voyageur, sur un fleuve emport�,
    Qui glisse sur les eaux par un beau soir d'�t�
    Et voit fuir sous ses yeux mille plaines fleuries,
    Ma pens� entra�n�e erre en tes r�veries!

DO�A SOL.
    Ce silence est trop noir, ce calme est trop profond.
    Dis, ne voudrais-tu pas voir une �toile au fond?
    Ou qu'une voix des nuits, tendre et d�licieuse,
    S'�levant tout � coup, chant�t?...

HERNANI (_souriant_).
    Capricieuse!
    Tout � l'heure on fuyait la lumi�re et les chants!

DO�A SOL.
    Le bal! Mais un oiseau qui chanterait aux champs!
    Un rossignol perdu dans l'ombre et dans la mousse,
    Ou quelque fl�te au loin!... Car la musique est douce,
    Fait l'�me harmonieuse, et, comme un divin choeur,
    �veille mille voix qui chantent dans le coeur
    Ah! ce serait charmant[19]!

_On entend le bruit lointain d'un cor dans l'ombre._
    Dieu! je suis exauc�e!

HERNANI (_tressaillant, � part_).
    Ah! malheureuse!

DO�A SOL.
    Un ange a compris ma pens�e.
    Ton bon ange sans doute?

HERNANI (_am�rement_).
    Oui, mon bon ange!

_Le cor recommence.--A part_.
    Encor!

DO�A SOL (_souriant_).
    Don Juan, je reconnais le son de votre cor!

HERNANI.
    N'est-ce pas?

DO�A SOL.
    Seriez-vous dans cette s�r�nade
    De moiti�[20]?

HERNANI.
    De moiti�, tu l'as dit.

DO�A SOL.
    Bal maussade!
    Oh! que j'aime bien mieux le cor au fond des bois!
    Et puis, c'est votre cor, c'est comme votre voix.

_Le cor recommence._

HERNANI (_� part_).
    Ah! le tigre est en bas qui hurle, et veut sa proie.

DO�A SOL.
    Don Juan, cette harmonie emplit le coeur de joie.

HERNANI (_se levant terrible_).
    Nommez-moi Hernani! nommez-moi Hernani!
    Avec ce nom fatal je n'en ai pas fini!

DO�A SOL (_tremblante_).
    Qu'avez-vous?

HERNANI.
    Le vieillard!

DO�A SOL.
    Dieu! quels regards fun�bres!
    Qu'avez-vous?

HERNANI.
    Le vieillard, qui rit dans les t�n�bres!
    --Ne le voyez-vous pas?

DO�A SOL.
    O� vous �garez-vous?
    Qu'est-ce que ce vieillard?

HERNANI.
    Le vieillard!

DO�A SOL (_tombant � genoux_).
    A genoux
    Je t'en supplie, oh! dis, quel secret te d�chire?
    Qu'as-tu?

HERNANI.
    Je l'ai jur�!

DO�A SOL.
    Jur�?

_Elle suit tous ses mouvements avec anxi�t�. Il s'arr�te tout � coup et
passe la main sur son front_.

HERNANI (� part).
    Qu'allais-je dire?
    �pargnons-la.

_Haut_.
    Moi, rien. De quoi t'ai-je parl�?

DO�A SOL.
    Vous avez dit...

HERNANI.
    Non. Non. J'avais l'esprit troubl�...
    Je souffre un peu, vois-tu. N'en prends pas d'�pouvante.

DO�A SOL.
    Te faut-il quelque chose? ordonne � ta servante.

_Le cor recommence_.

HERNANI (_� part_).
    Il le veut! il le veut! Il a mon serment!

_Cherchant � sa ceinture sans �p�e et sans poignard_.
    --Rien!
    Ce devrait �tre fait[21]!--Ah!...

DO�A SOL.
    Tu souffres donc bien.

HERNANI.
    Une blessure ancienne, et qui semblait ferm�e,
    Se rouvre...

_A part_.
    �loignons-la.

_Haut_.
    Do�a Sol, bien-aim�e,
    �coute. Ce coffret qu'en des jours--moins heureux
    Je portais avec moi...

DO�A SOL.
    Je sais ce que tu veux.
    Eh bien, qu'en veux-tu faire?

HERNANI.
    Un flacon qu'il renferme
    Contient un �lixir, qui pourra mettre un terme
    Au mal que je ressens.--Va!

DO�A SOL.
    J'y vais, mon seigneur.

_Elle sort par la porte de la chambre nuptiale.




SC�NE IV.


HERNANI (_seul_).
    Voil� donc ce qu'il vient faire de mon bonheur!
    Voici le doigt fatal qui luit sur la muraille!
    Oh! que la destin�e am�rement me raille!

_Il tombe dans une profonde et convulsive r�verie, puis se d�tourne
brusquement_.
    Eh bien?...--Mais tout se tait. Je n'entends rien venir.
    Si je m'�tais tromp�?...

_Le masque en domino noir parait au haut de la rampe. Hernani
s'arr�te p�trifi�_.




SC�NE V.

HERNANI, LE MASQUE.


LE MASQUE.
    �Quoi qu'il puisse advenir,
    Quand tu voudras, vieillard, quel que soit le lieu, l'heure,
    S'il te passe � l'esprit qu'il est temps que je meure,
    Viens, sonne de ce cor, et ne prends d'autres soins.
    Tout sera fait.�--Ce pacte eut les morts pour t�moins.
    Eh bien, tout est-il fait?

HERNANI (_� voix basse_).
    C'est lui!

LE MASQUE.
    Dans ta demeure
    Je viens, et je te dis qu'il est temps. C'est mon heure.
    Je te trouve en retard.

HERNANI.
    Bien. Quel est ton plaisir?
    Que feras-tu de moi? Parle.

LE MASQUE.
    Tu peux choisir
    Du fer ou du poison. Ce qu'il faut, je l'apporte.
    Nous partirons tous deux.

HERNANI.
    Soit.

LE MASQUE.
    Prions-nous?

HERNANI.
    Qu'importe!

LE MASQUE.
    Que prends-tu?

HERNANI.
    Le poison.

LE MASQUE.
    Bien!--Donne-moi ta main.

_Il pr�sente une fiole � Hernani, qui la re�oit en p�lissant_.
    Bois,--pour que je finisse.

_Hernani approche la fiole de ses l�vres, puis recule_.

HERNANI.
    Oh! par piti�, demain!--
    Oh! s'il te reste un coeur, duc, ou du moins une �me,
    Si tu n'es pas un spectre �chapp� de la flamme,
    Un mort damn�, fant�me ou d�mon d�sormais,
    Si Dieu n'a point encor mis sur ton front: jamais!
    Si tu sais ce que c'est que ce bonheur supr�me
    D'aimer, d'avoir vingt ans, d'�pouser quand on aime,
    Si jamais femme aim�e a trembl� dans tes bras,
    Attends jusqu'� demain! Demain tu reviendras!

LE MASQUE.
    Simple qui parle ainsi! Demain! demain!--Tu railles!
    Ta cloche a ce matin sonn� tes fun�railles!
    Et que ferais-je, moi, cette nuit?	J'en mourrais.
    Et qui viendrait te prendre et t'emporter apr�s?
    Seul descendre au tombeau! Jeune homme, il faut me suivre!

HERNANI.
    Eh bien, non! et de toi, d�mon, je me d�livre!
    Je n'ob�irai pas.

LE MASQUE.
    Je m'en doutais. Fort bien.
    Sur quoi donc m'as-tu fait ce serment!--Ah! sur rien.
    Peu de chose, apr�s tout! La t�te de ton p�re!
    Cela peut s'oublier. La jeunesse est l�g�re.

HERNANI.
    Mon p�re! Mon p�re!...--Ah! j'en perdrai la raison!

LE MASQUE.
    Non, ce n'est qu'un parjure et qu'une trahison.

HERNANI
    Duc!

LE MASQUE.
    Puisque les a�n�s des maisons espagnoles
    Se font jeu maintenant de fausser leurs paroles,
    Adieu!

_Il fait un pas pour sortir_.

HERNANI.
    Ne t'en va pas.

LE MASQUE.
    Alors...

HERNANI.
    Vieillard cruel

_Il prend la fiole._
    Revenir sur mes pas � la porte du ciel!

_Rentre do�a Sol, sans voir le masque, qui est debout, au fond_.




SC�NE VI.

LES M�MES, DO�A SOL.


DO�A SOL.
    Je n'ai pu le trouver, ce coffret.

HERNANI(_� part_).
    Dieu! C'est elle!
    Dans quel moment!

DO�A SOL.
    Qu'a-t-il? je l'effraie, il chancelle
    A ma voix!--Que tiens-tu dans ta main? quel soup�on!
    Que tiens-tu dans ta main? r�ponds.

_Le domino s'est approch� et se d�masque. Elle pousse un cri, et
reconna�t don Ruy._
    C'est du poison!

HERNANI.
    Grand Dieu!

DO�A SOL (_� Hernani_).
    Que t'ai-je fait? quel horrible myst�re!
    Vous me trompiez, don Juan!

HERNANI.
    Ah! j'ai d� te le taire.
    J'ai promis de mourir au duc qui me sauva.
    Aragon doit payer cette dette � Silva.

DO�A SOL.
    Vous n'�tes pas � lui, mais � moi. Que m'importe
    Tous vos autres serments!

_A don Ruy Gomez._
    Duc, l'amour me rend forte,
    Contre vous, contre tous, duc, je le d�fendrai.

DON RUY GOMEZ (_immobile_).
    D�fends-le, si tu peux, contre un serment jur�.

DO�A SOL.
    Quel serment?

HERNANI.
    J'ai jur�.

DO�A SOL.
    Non, non, rien ne te lie!
    Cela ne se peut pas! Crime! attentat! folie!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Allons, duc!

_Hernani fait un geste pour ob�ir. Do�a Sol cherche � l'entra�ner_.

HERNANI.
    Laissez-moi, do�a Sol. Il le faut.
    Le duc a ma parole, et mon p�re est l�-haut!

DO�A SOL (_� don Ruy Gomez_).
    Il vaudrait mieux pour vous aller aux tigres m�me
    Arracher leurs petits qu'� moi celui que j'aime!
    Savez-vous ce que c'est que do�a Sol? Longtemps,
    Par piti� pour votre �ge et pour vos soixante ans,
    J'ai fait la fille douce, innocente et timide,
    Mais voyez-vous cet oeil de pleurs de rage humide?

_Elle tire un poignard de son sein_.
    Voyez-vous ce poignard?--Ah! vieillard insens�,
    Craignez vous pas le fer quand l'oeil a menac�?
    Prenez-garde, don Ruy!--Je suis de la famille.
    Mon oncle!--�coutez-moi. Fuss�-je votre fille[22],
    Malheur si vous portez la main sur mon �poux!

_Elle jette le poignard, et tombe � genoux devant le duc_.
    Ah! je tombe � vos pieds! Ayez piti� de nous!
    Gr�ce! H�las! monseigneur, je ne suis qu'une femme,
    Je suis faible, ma force avorte dans mon �me,
    Je me brise ais�ment. Je tombe � vos genoux!
    Ah! je vous en supplie, ayez piti� de nous.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Do�a Sol!

DO�A SOL.
    Pardonnez! Nous autres Espagnoles,
    Notre douleur s'emporte � de vives paroles,
    Vous le savez. H�las! vous n'�tiez pas m�chant!
    Piti�! vous me tuez, mon oncle, en le touchant!
    Piti�! je l'aime tant!

DON RUY GOMEZ (_sombre_).
    Vous l'aimez trop!

HERNANI.
    Tu pleures!

DO�A SOL.
    Non, non, je ne veux pas, mon amour, que tu meures!
    Non! je ne le veux pas.

_A don Ruy_.
    Faites gr�ce aujourd'hui!
    Je vous aimerai bien aussi, vous.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Apr�s lui!
    De ces restes d'amour, d'amiti�,--moins encore,
    Croyez-vous apaiser la soif qui me d�vore?

_Montrant Hernani_.
    Il est seul! il est tout! Mais moi, belle piti�!
    Qu'est-ce que je peux faire avec votre amiti�?
    O rage! il aurait, lui, le coeur, l'amour, le tr�ne,
    Et d'un regard de vous il me ferait l'aum�ne!
    Et s'il fallait un mot � mes voeux insens�s,
    C'est lui qui vous dirait:--Dis cela, c'est assez!--
    En maudissant tous bas le mendiant avide!
    Auquel il faut jeter le fond du verre vide
    Honte! d�rision! non. Il faut en finir.
    Bois.

HERNANI.
    Il a ma parole, et je dois la tenir.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Allons!

_Hernani approche la fiole de ses l�vres. Do�a Sol se jette sur son
bras_.

DO�A SOL.
    Oh! pas encor! Daignez tous deux m'entendre.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Le s�pulcre est ouvert, et je ne puis attendre.

DO�A SOL.
    Un instant!--Mon seigneur! Mon don Juan!--Ah!
    tous deux
    Vous �tes bien cruels! Qu'est-ce que je veux d'eux?
    Un instant! voil� tout, tout ce que je r�clame!
    Enfin, on laisse dire � cette pauvre femme
    Ce qu'elle a dans le coeur!...--Oh! laissez-moi parler!

DON RUY GOMEZ (_� Hernani_).
    J'ai h�te.

DO�A SOL.
    Messeigneurs, vous me faites trembler!
    Que vous ai-je donc fait?

HERNANI.
    Ah! son cri me d�chire.

DO�A SOL (_lui retenant toujours le bras_).
    Vous voyez bien que j'ai mille choses � dire!

DON RUY GOMEZ (_� Hernani_).
    Il faut mourir.

DO�A SOL (_toujours pendue au bras d'Hernani_).
    Don Juan, lorsque j'aurai parl�
    Tout ce que tu voudras, tu le feras.

_Elle lui arrache la fiole_.
    Je l'ai!

_Elle �l�ve la fiole aux yeux d'Hernani et du vieillard �tonn�_.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Puisque je n'ai c�ans affaire qu'� deux femmes,
    Don Juan, il faut qu'ailleurs j'aille chercher des �mes.
    Tu fais de beaux serments par le sang dont tu sors,
    Et je vais � ton p�re en parler chez les morts!
    --Adieu...

_Il fait quelques pas pour sortir. Hernani le retient_.

HERNANI.
    Duc, arr�tez!

_A do�a Sol._
    H�las! je t'en conjure,
    Veux-tu me voir faussaire, et f�lon, et parjure?
    Veux-tu que partout j'aille avec la trahison
    �crite sur le front? Par piti�, ce poison,
    Rends-le-moi! Par l'amour, par notre �me immortelle!...

DO�A SOL (_sombre_).
    Tu veux?

_Elle boit_.
   Tiens, maintenant.

DON RUY GOMEZ (_� part_).
    Ah! c'�tait donc pour elle!

DO�A SOL (_rendant � Hernani la fiole � demi vid�e_).
    Prends, te dis-je.

HERNANI (_� don Ruy_).
    Vois-tu, mis�rable vieillard!

DO�A SOL.
    Ne te plains pas de moi, je t'ai gard� ta part.

HERNANI (_prenant la fiole_).
    Dieu!

DO�A SOL.
    Tu ne m'aurais pas ainsi laiss� la mienne,
    Toi! Tu n'as pas le coeur d'une �pouse chr�tienne.
    Tu ne sais pas aimer comme aime une Silva.
    Mais j'ai bu la premi�re et suis tranquille.--Va!
    Bois si tu veux!

HERNANI.
    H�las! qu'as-tu fait, malheureuse?

DO�A SOL.
    C'est toi qui l'as voulu.

HERNANI.
    C'est une mort affreuse!

DO�A SOL.
    Non. Pourquoi donc?

HERNANI.
    Ce philtre au s�pulcre conduit.

DO�A SOL.
    Devions-nous pas dormir ensemble cette nuit?
    Qu'importe dans quel lit?

HERNANI.
    Mon p�re, tu te venges
    Sur moi qui t'oubliais!

_Il porte la fiole � sa bouche_.

DO�A SOL (_se jetant sur lui_).
    Ciel! des douleurs �tranges!...
    Ah! jette loin de toi ce philtre!--Ma raison
    S'�gare. Arr�te! H�las! mon don Juan, ce poison
    Est vivant! ce poison dans le coeur fait �clore
    Une hydre � mille dents qui ronge et qui d�vore!
    Oh! je ne savais pas qu'on souffr�t � ce point!
    Qu'est-ce donc que cela? c'est du feu! Ne bois point!
    Oh! tu souffrirais trop!

HERNANI (_a don Ruy_).
    Ah! ton �me est cruelle!
    Pouvais-tu pas choisir d'autre poison pour elle?

_Il boit et jette la fiole_.

DO�A SOL.
    Que fais-tu?

HERNANI.
    Qu'as-tu fait?

DO�A SOL.
    Viens, � mon jeune amant,
    Dans mes bras.

_Ils s'asseyent l'un pr�s de l'autre_.
    N'est-ce pas qu'on souffre horriblement?

HERNANI.
    Non.

DO�A SOL.
    Voil� notre nuit de noces commenc�e!
    Je suis bien p�le, dis, pour une fianc�e?

HERNANI.
    Ah!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    La fatalit� s'accomplit.

HERNANI.
    D�sespoir!
    O tourment! do�a Sol souffrir, et moi le voir!

DO�A SOL.
    Calme-toi. Je suis mieux.--Vers des clart�s nouvelles
    Nous allons tout � l'heure ensemble ouvrir nos ailes.
    Partons d'un vol �gal vers un monde meilleur.
    Un baiser seulement, un baiser!

_Ils s'embrassent_.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    O douleur!

HERNANI (_d'une voix affaiblie_).
    Oh! b�ni soit le ciel qui m'a fait une vie
    D'ab�mes entour�e et de spectres suivie,
    Mais qui permet que, las d'un si rude chemin,
    Je puisse m'endormir ma bouche sur ta main!

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Qu'ils sont heureux[23]!

HERNANI (_d'une voix d plus en plus faible_).
    Viens, viens... do�a Sol... tout est sombre...
    Souffres-tu?

DO�A SOL (_d'une voix �galement �teinte_).
    Rien, plus rien.

HERNANI.
    Vois-tu des feux dans l'ombre?

DO�A SOL.
    Pas encor.

HERNANI (_avec un soupir_).
    Voici...

_Il tombe_.

DON RUY GOMEZ (_soulevant sa t�te, qui retombe_).
    Mort!

DO�A SOL (_�chevel�e, et se dressant � demi sur son s�ant_).
    Mort! non pas! nous dormons.
    Il dort. C'est mon �poux, vois-tu. Nous nous aimons.
    Nous sommes couch�s l�. C'est notre nuit de noce.

_D'une voix qui s'�teint_.
    Ne le r�veillez pas, seigneur duc de Mendoce.
    Il est las.

_Elle retourne la figure d'Hernani_.
    Mon amour, tiens-toi vers moi tourn�.
    Plus pr�s... plus pr�s encor...

_Elle retombe_.

DON RUY GOMEZ.
    Morte!--Oh! je suis damn�.

_Il se tue_.




NOTES.




PREFACE.


1: po�te mort. In the volume entitled �Litt�rature et Philosophie
m�l�es� of the _�dition d�finitive_, Hugo has an article �sur M.
Dovalle�, which contains this quotation. Charles Dovalle, born 1807,
killed in a duel 1829, was the author of a volume of poetry, �Le
Sylphe�, which appeared in 1830, with a preface by Hugo.

2: censure. During the Revolution all restrictions upon the liberty
of the press were removed, but in 1810 a directorship was established.
The charter of Louis XVIII in 1814 restored full liberty, but
restrictions were presently imposed, nevertheless. In 1819 the
censorship gave place to a system of sureties. An ordinance of St.
Cloud, in 1830, suspending the liberty of the press was one of the
causes of the revolution in that year, and the restrictions were
temporarily removed. Since then a limited censorship has generally
been maintained, but chiefly in regard to politics and criminal
processes.

3: r�gles de d'Aubignac. Fran�ois H�delin, abb� d'Aubignac
(1604-1676), was an authoritative literary critic, champion of
Aristotle and the three unities, author of a prose tragedy, Z�nobie,
composed according to these rules and very stupid, and of a �Pratique
du Th��tre�. He was a bitter opponent of Corneille.

4: Cujas (1522-1590), a celebrated jurist of Toulouse, who
interpreted the Roman law in a more historical and less practical
sense than had been usual in France. His name thus stands for legal
pedantry. _Coutumes_ means legal usages, unwritten law.

5: Ni talons rouges, ni bonnets rouges. To wear red heels was a
privilege of aristocracy under the _ancien r�gime_, and the
_bonnet rouge_ was the liberty cap adopted as a head-dress by the
Revolutionists.

6: L'autre Saint Office, the Inquisition.

7: Romancero general, a collection of Spanish ballads, first
published under this name in 1604 and 1605. They were taken for
the most part, however, from song-books of the previous century,
especially a _Cancionero general_ of 1511, and a _Cancionero de
romances_ of 1555. But Hugo derived little from the _Romancero
general_ except the spirit of chivalry with which his drama is imbued.

8: The absurdly rigid critics of Corneille's day (1606-1684) found
fault even with the �Cid� for not being sufficiently classical;
Corneille himself called �Don Sanche� _une com�die h�ro�que_, and was
at great pains to defend it as _un po�me d'une esp�ce nouvelle, et qui
n'a point d'exemple chez les anciens_. �Nicom�de� gave him the same
misgivings, and Voltaire, the most meticulous of critics, charged it
with being _trop vulgaire, trop populaire_.

9: Bourges. The cathedral of Bourges, a small city in central
France, is one of the most sincere and impressive monuments of Gothic
architecture. Its massiveness and originality atone easily for the
incongruities of its style.

10: PENDANT OPERA INTERRUPTA, Virgil, AEneid, iv. 88.




ACT I.


1: Isabelle la catholique (1451-1504), queen of Castile, and
patroness of Columbus. Her marriage with Ferdinand of Aragon (1469)
assured the unity of Spain. They are known in history as _Los reyes
catolicos_.

2: le regarde sous le nez, �looks sharply into his face�.

3: main-forte, �Help!� Understand _pr�tez_.

4: Fianc�e au vieux duc. Such a marriage was not legitimate except by
papal dispensation.

5: son vieux futur, �her old intended�.

6: Si! Affirmative answer to a negative statement or question.

7: Le manche du balai, an indirect way of calling the duenna an old
witch.

8: Est-ce pas. The omission of _ne_ in such a case is frequent enough
in everyday speech; but here it is made in order to save a syllable.

9: The first part of this dialogue in Sc. 2 is very beautiful.
Notice the eagerness, tinged with melancholy, with which Hernani
goes straight to the subject of his love and appeals to Do�a Sol's
sympathy, while she pretends to think only of his wet mantle, and
answers him evasively. The scene reminds one of the celebrated passage
in Goethe's �Egmont�, where Egmont visits Cl�rchen in his Spanish
costume.

10: De temp�te and d'�clairs depend upon _ce_ in the preceding line.

11: Est mort sur l'�chafaud. It is not known that Hugo refers here
to any historical incident. The father of the king was Philip the
Handsome, son of the Emperor Maximilian, of the house of Austria. The
king's mother was Joanna, �crazy Jane�, daughter of Ferdinand and
Isabella. Charles ascended the throne of the Castiles (Old and New) in
1516.

12: IL FAUT QUE J'EN ARRIVE � M'EFFRAYER MOI-M�ME, �Fate has made me
a horror to myself.�

13: riche-homme, �high-counsellor�, an imitation of the Span.
_ricohombre_.

14: Grand de Castille, �grandee of Castile�.

15: ENV�RA, a contraction of _enviera_.

16: peut-�tre aurais-je aussi, �perhaps I have too�, etc. There is
here a suppressed condition, by the hint of which the mystery of the
words is increased. But it will be seen, two lines further on,
that where _ai-je_ suits the metre the indicative is employed in a
precisely similar case.

17: ma bande, comme on dit, �my band, as they call it�, this emphasis
on the word _bande_ being used to bring out the etymological force of
_bandit_ in the next line.

18: Toutes les Espagnes, for the Span. _todas las Espa�as_, by which
was meant the kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, Leon, and Navarre.

19: La veille Catalogne. Catalonia, a province at the foot of the
Pyrenees, in the northeastern corner of Spain.

20: IL ME SOUVIENT, �I remember�. The verb is impersonal; _pas_ is
not the antecedent of _il_.

21: veuillez, quoi qu'il advienne, �please, whatever may happen.�

22: mais, � ce qu'il para�t, �why, apparently.�

23: et veux conna�tre, �and I wish to know whom I have seen.�
_Savoir_ would be more proper than _conna�tre_.

24: Madame. The word had not always reference to a married woman
only, and of course it does not have here; translate �milady�.

25: Je chiffonais ma veste � la fran�aise, �I was rumpling my French
doublet.�

26: de belles �quip�es, �fine doings�.

27: Saint Jacques monseigneur, �My lord Saint James.� James the
apostle is patron saint of Spain.

28: T�te et sang, a fragment of the old forms of the oaths _t�te
Dieu, sang Dieu_, which if expanded, in modern French, would be _par
la t�te de Dieu, par le sang de Dieu_.

29: C'est trop de deux. �It is two too many.�

30: Le Cid. An historical character of the eleventh century, by name
Ruy Diaz de Vivar, whom the Spaniards called _el Campeador_, the
Warrior, and the Arabs _Seid_, Lord, from which words came his popular
name, _el Cid Campeador_. He early became the subject of poems, of
which the oldest is the _Poema del Cid_, which dates from the
middle of the twelfth century. For the next four hundred years his
adventures, real and supposed, form the staple of the heroic romances
of Spain.

31: Bernard. Bernardo del Carpio, a semi-mythical character of the
eighth century, the reputed slayer of Roland at Roncesvalles; he also
was a hero of romance.

32: Faisait agenouiller leur amour aux �glises. �Sought for their
love the church's sanction.�

33: Zamora, a small city on the river Duero. Hugo probably alludes to
its falling into the hands of Ferdinand in 1476.

34: carrousels, �tourneys�.

35: Or il faut que, �Now, if I go out but for an hour.�

36: Toison d'or. The order of the Golden Fleece was founded at Bruges
in 1429, by Philip, Duke of Burgundy, the husband of Isabella of
Portugal. It numbered originally thirty-one knights, pledged to defend
the faith, as the Argonauts had been pledged to seek the golden
fleece. Saint Simon tells us that this order and that of the Garter
were the only ones compatible with the French order of the Holy Ghost.
The marriage of Philip's grand-daughter to Maximilian of Austria in
1477, transferred the grand-mastership to the house of Hapsburg.

37: F�al, an old word, equivalent to _fid�le_.

38: En ton palais. The preposition _dans_ is regularly used before a
defined noun, that is, a noun with an adjective or adjectival phrase.
But _dans_ would increase the line by one syllable, so that this is a
proper place for the exercise of poetic license.

39: Pour l'aller dire, would, in correct prose, be _pour aller le
dire_, but the same reason and the same permissible license have
prevailed here as in the preceding line.

40: Figu�re, Span. _Figueras_, a fortified city in Catalonia, near
the French border.

41: Note, in this scene, the indifference of Don Carlos to the
subject of his grandfather's memory, contrasted with the piety of Don
Ruy Gomez.

42: Aix-la-Chapelle, German _Aachen_, Latin _Aquis granum_. Pronounce
Aix like _ex_. In its minster (_la chapelle_, whence the name)
Charlemagne is buried. It was here that the emperors were crowned, up
to Ferdinand I, who acceded in 1558.

43: Spire, German _Speyer_, celebrated for its cathedral, in which
many of the emperors are buried.

44: Francfort, German _Frankfurt am Main_, where, and not in Aachen,
the election took place.

45: aura ceci pr�sent, �will remember this.�

46: On est bourgeois de Gand, �I am a citizen of Ghent�, having been
born there, and hence being eligible to the imperial throne, as Ghent
was in the Empire.

47: Rome est pour moi, meaning that the Pope favored his claims,
which, however, he did not, but endeavored to remain neutral.

48: Cette t�te allait bien au vieux corps germanique, �He was a
proper head to the old German body�, meaning by _t�te_ Maximilian, and
by _corps_ the Empire.

49: Le pape veut ravoir le Sicile. Since 1266, when Charles d'Anjou
was made a vassal of Pope Clement IV. and invested with Sicily and
Naples, the Holy See was considered to have some claim on them; but in
fact these possessions, called the Two Sicilies, had since 1282 been,
in the main, dependencies of the Spanish throne.

50: l'aigle, the imperial eagle, used here figuratively for what it
represented.

51: Qu'avec joie il verrait, �With what joy he would behold�; still
speaking of the late Emperor.

52: Que ferez-vous, mon fils. The supposed thoughts and remarks of
the Pope.

53: Consolez-vous! Don Ruy Gomez is still piously thinking of the
Emperor's death.

54: Sa France tr�s-chr�tienne. The kings of France were officially
denominated �Most Christian� and those of Spain �Most Catholic�.

55: Ah! la part est pourtant belle, et vaut qu'on s'y tienne. �Ah!
but that is a portion grand enough and worth holding to�, meaning that
France was enough for Francis.

56: Au roi Louis. Louis XII (1498-1515), predecessor of Francis I.

57: C'est un victorieux. Francis had since his accession to the
throne of France, in 1515, crossed the Alps, beaten the Swiss at
Marignan (Ital. _Melegnano_), and conquered the territory of Milan. He
did in fact dispute the claims of Charles to the imperial crown, but
by no means victoriously, for he was beaten and taken prisoner at the
battle of Pavia, in 1525. After the treaty of Madrid and his release
he entered into an alliance with Henry the Eighth, of England, and the
Italian states against Charles, and recommenced hostilities. This war,
however, ending in the peace of Cambrai in 1529, gave Italy definitely
into the hands of the Emperor. Francis' unsuccessful wars against
Charles continued until the peace of Cr�py, in 1544.

58: Il faudrait tout changer. �Everything would have to be changed�,
meaning that the election of Francis would be contrary to the
constitution of the Empire.

59: La bulle d'or. The Golden Bull (so called because of the pendent
gold seal, _bulla aurea_) was a decree of the Emperor Charles IV,
issued at the diet in Metz, in 1336, determining the choice of
emperors by a majority of the seven electors, whom it designated. The
_bulla aurea_ is still preserved in the �R�mer� at Frankfort.

60: A ce compte, seigneur, vous �tes roi d'Espagne! �In that case,
my lord, you are King of Spain!� Don Ruy speaks with suppressed
exultation. The old nobility of Spain, and patriotic Spaniards
generally, looked with reluctance upon Charles' candidacy for the
imperial crown. Robertson, in his �History of the Reign of Charles the
Fifth�, says: �The Spaniards were far from viewing the promotion of
their king to the imperial throne with the same satisfaction which he
himself felt. To be deprived of the presence of their sovereign, and
to be subjected to the government of a viceroy and his council, a
species of administration often oppressive and always disagreeable,
were the immediate and necessary consequences of this new dignity. To
see the blood of their countrymen shed in quarrels wherein the nation
had no concern, to behold its treasures wasted in supporting the
splendor of a foreign title, were effects of this event almost as
unavoidable. From all these considerations they concluded that nothing
could have happened more pernicious to the Spanish nation; and the
fortitude and public spirit of their ancestors, who, in the Cortes of
Castile, prohibited Alfonzo the Wise from leaving the kingdom in order
to receive the imperial crown, were often mentioned with the highest
pride, and pronounced to be extremely worthy of imitation at this
juncture.�

61: Je suis bourgeois de Gand. As a native of Ghent he claimed
citizenship in the Empire, Ghent being in Austrian Flanders.

62: On le dit un rude compagnon. �He is said to be a tough customer.�

63: Galice, Galicia, a mountainous province in Spain, just north of
Portugal.

64: J'en aurai raison. �I shall bring him to terms�, overcome him.

65: Oui, de ta suite, � roi! For such lines as this and the next
following Victor Hugo was much ridiculed when the tragedy first
appeared; and indeed a play upon words which involves such cacophony
is a doubtful ornament.

66: J'oubliais en l'aimant ta haine qui me charge. �I was forgetting
in my love of her my hate of you which fills me.�

67: mouton d'or, the golden ram, the decoration worn by members of
the order of the Golden Fleece.

countess.�

6: C'est ce que nous disons, etc. �That is what we often say in your
Highness' antechamber.�

7: Cependant que for _pendant que_.

8: mon peuple, �my servants�. It is barely possible that the king
means to return Don Sancho's compliment goodnaturedly, but more
probably he says this to show him his place.

9: Poussez au dr�le une estocade. �Give the rascal a thrust.�

10: Pendant qu'il reprendra ses esprits sur le gr�s. �While he is
recovering his senses on the flagstones.�

capital is Pamplona. Navarre north of the Pyrenees, or Lower Navarre,
has belonged to France since 1589.

13: Murcie, Murcia, formerly a Moorish kingdom, on the eastern coast
of Spain.

14: les Flamands, �the Flemings�, inhabitants of the so-called
Spanish Netherlands, of which, in 1512, the Dutch provinces were
incorporated in the Burgundian division of the Empire.

15: l'Inde, �the Indies�, meaning all the Spanish possessions in
America and the West Indies.

16: vous en obliez un, alluding to the opening words of Sc. 4 of
Act 1.

17: me monte � sa taille, �lifts me to his height�.

18: Observe the change from _vous_ to _te_, to indicate the force
of the insult, the use of the second pers. sing. to persons whom one
would ordinarily address as _vous_ being a common way of expressing
contempt.

19: compagnon, �base fellow�.

20: � moi, added merely for emphasis.

21: ��, �there!� probably drawing his sword.

22: fiscal, a Spanish word meaning an officer whose duty it is to

ACT III.


1: plus d'oncle! �I shall be done with being uncle.�

2: Certe, for _certes_, the s being omitted to allow elision and thus
save a syllable.

3: On le verra bient�t. Does this mean: �It (my blood) will soon be
seen�; or, �That (its nobility) will soon be evident�?

4: D�rision! que cet amour boiteux... ait oubli�. �What mockery that
this decrepit, bungling love... should have forgotten.�

5: oui, c'en est l�, �yes, it has come to that.�

6: comme le tien. A glaring instance of _enjambement_, or the running
over of a clause at the end of a line.

7: J'ai nom Silva. The verb and the noun in this expression and many
similar ones are so closely connected that they may be considered as
forming a verbal expression, and indeed are frequently capable
of conversion into a verb. Here _j'ai nom_ is equivalent to _je
m'appelle_. Compare _trouver moyen, faire honneur, donner conseil_.

8: Le tout, pour �tre, etc. �I would give all to be�, etc.

9: qu'il ne s'use en paroles, �but that it will wear itself out in
mere words.�

10: � l'aile vive et peinte, etc. �with bright and flashing wing and
amorous song.� _Ramag_e originally meant only �boughs�, �foliage�,
then also _chant ramage_, �bird-song among the branches�.

11: Au coeur on n'a jamais de rides. A fine sentiment, and one of the
many in this Act which win for the chivalrous Don Ruy the reader's
sympathy and respect.

12: prunelle, translate simply �eye�.

13: encor. The _e_ is dropped to save a syllable, as the next word
begins with a consonant.

14: que introduces the real subject, _ce supr�me effort_, etc.
anticipated by _ce_ in _c'est_, line 25.

15: encor. See note 13.

of his remaining years.�

20: �cus du roi, �royal crown-pieces�.

21: pour l'instant, �at present�.

22: Paix et bonheur � vous. This salutation and the answer are
imitations of the Latin greetings between monks.

23: Armillas, a small mountain village in Aragon, near Montalvan,
about half-way between Saragossa and Teruel.

24: tu le pourras voir pendre. The object-pronoun is generally placed
directly before the verb on which it depends, so that this expression
would normally and in prose be _tu pourras le voir pendre_. Such
expressions as this, however, are common in Moli�re.

25: Del Pilar. �Our Lady of the Pillar�; one of the two cathedrals of
Saragossa, so called because of the legend that St. James, coming into
Spain soon after the crucifixion to preach the gospel, fell asleep;
whereupon the Virgin Mary appeared on a jasper pillar and desired him
to erect a church on that spot. She is said to have come afterwards
to mass in the chapel which was built there, and which is now in the
centre of the cathedral and contains the pillar. This relic is a
favorite object of pilgrimage, as it is believed to cure diseases.

26: au fond du sombre corridor, �at the end of the gloomy aisle�.

27: ch�sse ardente, �blazing shrine�.

28: cape, �cope�, a sacerdotal cloak reaching from the shoulders to
the feet, open in front, worn by priests celebrating mass.

29: ne te fais faute de rien, �make free use of everything�.

30: L'avoir pri�e to portera bonheur. �It will bring you good luck to
have prayed to her.�

31: carolus d'or, money pieces thus named because first coined under
Charles VIII of France and marked with his name.--(_Matzke_). Compare
_Louis d'or, Napol�on d'or_.

32: Perez ou Diego, meaning �You thought I was nobody in particular�,
these being very common Christian names.

33: Je vais faire armer le ch�teau. He means that the presence of
Hernani will attract the king's troops, against whom, by the rules of
hospitality, be feels bound to protect his guest.

34: cent fois moins. Supply _rare_.

35: Grand merci de l'amour s�r, profond et fid�le. Ironical: �Thanks
for such deep, sure, faithful love.�

36: ma patronne, �my patron saint�.

37: qui m'outragez, �who insult me�.

38: Croire que mon amour, etc. �How could he think that my love had
so short a memory! How could he think that all these inglorious men
could ever reduce a heart into which his name (Hernani's) has entered,
to lesser loves, though nobler in their eyes!�

39: insens�, �madman�.

40: Olmedo, a town of 2000 inhabitants, a few miles south of
Valladolid.

41: Alcala. There are several towns of this name. Probably Alcala de
Henares is meant, a city between Madrid and Saragossa.

42: encore un coup, �once more I say�.

43: Qu'on m'ait fait pour ha�r, depends upon _honteux_, as does also
_de n'avoir pu_, etc. by a double construction.

44: Estramadoure, �Estramadura�, formerly a province of Spain, west
of New Castile, on the borders of Portugal.

45: Ne te fais pas d'aimer une religion. �Do not sacrifice yourself
to love�, _religion_ being used in the special sense of �sacred
obligation�, �point of conscience�, and _aimer_ being used
substantively.

46: Que le mien. See note 14.

47: Ne m'en veux pas de fuir. �Be not vexed with me for flying.�

48: mes amis sont morts, meaning her eyes, drowned now in tears.

49: une amour. The plural of _amour_ is indiscriminately masculine
or feminine, in both prose and poetry; but the singular is now only
masculine in prose, and of either gender in poetry.

50: Qu'il en soit ainsi. �So be it!�

51: Ressaye ton harnois. �Put on again thine armor.� _Harnois_
poetical for _harnais_.

52: Fait lever sur mes pas des gibiers de bourreau, �started
gallows-birdsupon my path.�

53: sans pater, without _pater noster_; that is, unconfessed of their
sins.

54: Sforce, �Sforza�. This family ruled as dukes of Milan from 1147
to 1535. Galeazzo Maria Sforza, who died in 1476, is probably meant
here, as he was a notorious and wicked tyrant; though possibly the
author is thinking of Giovanni Galeazzo Sforza, lord of Pesaro, the
first husband of Lucretia Borgia.

55: Borgia, Caesar Borgia, son of Pope Alexander VI, was Cardinal in
1492, murdered his own brother in 1497, was a cruel and bloodthirsty
tyrant in Romagna, and was held two years in captivity in Spain by
Ferdinand the Catholic, finally losing his wicked life in 1507.

56: Luther, born 1483, died 1546, would naturally seem to a
contemporary Spaniard a monster fit to be classed with Caesar Borgia.

57: soeur du festin des sept t�tes, �a sister to the banquet of the
seven heads�, alluding to the old Spanish story of the Seven Lords of
Lara, a favorite theme with ancient ballad-writers, and upon which two
of Lope de Vega's dramas are based: �Los Siete Infantes de Lara� and
�El Bastardo Mudarra�. The seven sons of the Lord of Lara are said to
have been betrayed by their uncle (it is he who is meant in line 16)
to the Moors, who slew them. Their heads were served up at a banquet
to which their father was invited.

58: j'en jure, instead of _je le jure_, being perhaps an elliptical
expression in its origin for _j'en jure la v�rit�_.

59: qu'elle e�t h�te � ce point de reluire � ton poing = _qu'elle e�t
tellement h�te de reluire � ton poing, quand nous_, etc.

60: C'est s'y prendre un peu tard, etc. �You are beginning a little
late to play the young man.�

61: Boabdil, the last of the Moorish kings of Granada, driven out by
Ferdinand in 1492.

62: Mahom, an abbreviation of Mahomet; compare the English Mahound.

63: Mais qu'� cela ne tienne. �Why! do not let that hinder you.�

64: Don Silvius. Like the Italians, and indeed with just as good
reason, many great Spanish families are fond of claiming descent from
the heroes of ancient Rome.

65: Toro. A city of 9000 inhabitants between Valladolid and Zamora.

66: Valladolid. A famous city in the former kingdom of Leon, in the
northwest of Spain, famous for its situation, its antiquity, its
memories. Columbus died there, in 1506.

67: Tribut des cent vierges. The reference is to a story told in the
_Romancero general_, to the effect that a hundred virgins were offered
to the Moors as ransom for a prisoner.

68: Ramire. There were several kings by the name of Ramiro in the
history of Aragon.

69: Grand ma�tre de Saint Jacque et de Calatrava. The orders of
knighthood of St. James (Santiago) and of Calatrava were founded for
the purpose of resisting the Moors.

70: Motril. A town on the Mediterranean, south of Granada and east of
Malaga.

71: Antequera. A town of 20,000 inhabitants in Andalusia, between
Ronda and Granada.

72: Suez. The editor can find no place of this name on the map
of Spain. Perry suggests that the author may mean Sueca, south of
Valencia.

73: Nijar. A small town near the Mediterranean coast, a few miles
from Almeria.

74: tient � Silva, �has something to do with the house of Silva�, �is
affected by us�.

75: Sandoval, Manrique, Lara, Alencastre. Names of great families.

76: Zamet, Arabic Achmed. The present editor (and every other
apparently) is ignorant of any Zamet in legend or history to whom this
could refer.

77: Car vous me la pa�riez. �Because you would pay me a price for it,
would you not?� Don Ruy is continuing his own sentence, and alludes to
the head of Hernani.

78: n�tre, instead of _� nous_.

79: grand merci! The English �grammercy� is supposed to come from
this expression, though it has also been said to be a corruption of
�God have mercy!� Translate here: �Many thanks!� ironically.

80: The Duke of Alcala does not figure in the list of _dramatis
personae_, nor does he have a word to utter in the whole play.

81: que vite, �how quickly�.

82: mon infante, �my princess�.

83: malgr� mes voeux, �against my will�.

84: contente, imperative.

85: te laisseras-tu faire? �will you yield to me?�

86: see note 56, act IV.




ACT IV.


1: Aix la-Chapelle (Aachen) was the old Frankish capital. Charlemagne
held court there and at Engilenheim. He was buried there, A.D. 814,
in �that basilica which it had been the delight of his later years to
erect and adorn with the treasures of ancient art. His tomb under
the dome--where now we see an enormous slab, with the words 'Carolo
Magno'--was inscribed _Magnus atque Orthodoxus Imperator_�. (Bryce:
�Holy Roman Empire�.) Mr. Bryce adds: �This basilica was built upon
the model of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, and as
it was the first church of any size that had been erected in those
regions for centuries past, it excited extraordinary interest among
the Franks and Gauls. In many of its features it greatly resembles
the beautiful church of San Vitale, at Ravenna... Over the tomb of
Charles, below the central dome... there hangs a huge chandelier, the
gift of Frederick Barbarossa.�

2: Monsieur l'�lecteur de Tr�ves. The Archbishop of Trier stood out
for a long time in favor of Francis I.

3: O� Rodolphe extermina Lothaire. The allusion is not clear.

4: Gotha, the Duke of Gotha, heading the list of nobles opposed to
the election of Charles.

5: croi, instead of _crois_, for the sake of the rhyme with _moi_. It
must be remembered that French rhymes are made for the eye, sometimes,
more than for the ear.

6: Lutzelbourg, the duchy of Luxembourg, sometimes, with the city of
that name, called (in German) L�tzelburg.

7: est trop grand de la t�te, �is a head too tall�, _i.e._, will be
decapitated before he has done.

8: Astorga, a town in the kingdom of Leon, in northwestern Spain.

9: Ont toujours fait doubler la solde du bourreau, probably means
that so many of them have been executed, and such large game too, that
their deaths have enriched the executioner.

10: deux hardis compagnons, �two bold fellows�.

11: l'�largir, refers to _drap_ in the next line.

12: Un Saxon h�r�tique. Frederick, Elector of Saxony, was born in
1463. He was a generous patron of learning, founded in 1502 the
University of Wittenberg, and lent his powerful protection to Luther,
though he never publicly declared himself a Protestant. His declining
the imperial crown on this occasion, in 1519, has been already
mentioned. He died in 1525.

13: Des princes de Hesse. This is a mistake, if Hugo means that a
prince of Hesse was one of the electors, as there were none of that
house until 1803, when Landgrave William IX of Hesse-Cassel became
Elector with the title William I.

14: Dans ma peau de lion emporter comme Hercule. Hugo probably
alludes here to the story of Hercules and the Cercopes, two
mischievous gnomes who annoyed Hercules in his sleep and were captured
by him and given to Omphale. Baumeister (Denkm�ler des klassischen
Alterthums, Vol. 1. p. 664) thinks that these impish creatures may
have been monkeys. I can find no statement that Hercules carried them
off in his lion's skin, but he is said to have strung them by their
feet to a pole.

15: Triboulet, a deformed court jester of King Francis I of France,
and the grotesque hero of Hugo's play �Le Roi s'amuse�. Translate:
�would be a head shorter than Triboulet himself�.

16: Gand, Tol�de, Salamanque, Ghent, Toledo, Salamanca.

17: For cacophony this line would be hard to beat. It sounds like
the croaking of frogs; and there is no reason apparent why the author
should indulge in such a hideous eccentricity.

18: sauf, plus tard, � les reprendre, �with the mental reservation
that I _might_ take them back�.

19: Vous vous couvrez? The wily Ricardo, hearing the king address him
familiarly with _tu_ (l. 17), which was the form of address from the
kings of Spain to grandees, whom they also called �cousin�, puts on
his hat in the king's presence--another privilege of a grandee.

20: Baste, �enough�, from the Italian _basta_.

21: Peut-�tre on voudra d'un C�sar. �Perhaps she will put up with an
emperor.�

22: Ce Corneille Agrippa pourtant en sait bien long! �And yet this
Cornelius Agrippa has great insight!� Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa
von Nettesheim, born 1486 at Cologne, died 1535 at Grenoble, was
a celebrated scholar, who filled various offices, of more or less
doubtful character, under the Emperor Maximilian I. and Francis I. He
wrote a satire �De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum�, and a work
against witchcraft, �De occulta philosophia�, but had the reputation
of being a magician himself.

23: l'abb� Jean Trith�me. Johannes Tritheim, born in 1462 at
Trittenheim, near Trier, was a Benedictine monk, who became abbot of
St. James in W�rzburg, where he died in 1516. He wrote a number of
semi-historical works, and had a reputation for supernatural wisdom.

24: comte de Limburg. Limburg was a duchy, west of Aachen, now
divided between Belgium and the Netherlands.

25: gardien capitulaire, guardian of the tomb of Charlemagne, by
appointment of the monastic chapter which had it in charge.

26: SCENE II. This is one of the most powerful passages in Victor
Hugo's writings. It would be hard to say to what extent the sentiments
here expressed were his personally. At any rate, it is a grandiloquent
exposition of the imperial idea. As Mr. H.A. Perry remarks, the poet
is evidently thinking, and with intense sympathy, of the aspirations
of Napoleon I. and his ambition to subject the Pope to himself. It
is in this scene that Charles is represented as changing from a
headstrong, frivolous, undisciplined libertine into a grave man made
noble by a sense of responsibility. It may be questioned whether so
sudden a transformation is possible, and certain it is that in the
play the Charles of the preceding part is not the same man as he who
emerges from the tomb of Charlemagne. It is improbable that the mere
heightening of a weak, bad man's ambition would make him good and
great in half an hour. But such contrasts are Hugo's delight.

27: un monde cr�ateur, meaning the Middle Ages, as an epoch fertile
in great institutions.

28: le hasard corrige le hasard, means that whatever the oppression
of the time, it is probable that the people will have a friend either
in the Pope or the Emperor, and if one is tyrannical the other may be
clement.

29: toujours l'ordre �clate, �order still springs forth�.

30: Qu'une id�e, au besoin des temps, un jour �lose. �Let but a
thought, in the fulness of time, some day burst forth.�

31: Se fait homme, �becomes incarnate�.

32: These lines are packed with meaning, the principal idea being
that the will of the people and the will of God will from time to time
find personification in an elective Pope or an elective Emperor, and
triumph over hereditary sovereigns and time-honored prerogatives.

33: di�te is the legislative assembly of the Empire, conclave the
assembly of cardinals to elect a Pope.

34: suaire, lit. �shroud�; but it is difficult to see why Hugo
chose this word for the papal mantle, unless helped there-to by the
necessity of finding a rhyme for _sanctuaire_.

35: Pierre et C�sar, en eux accouplant les deux Romes, the idea so
much insisted on by Dante in the De Monarchia and the Divine Comedy,
that the spiritual Rome of Peter's founding and the temporal Roman
Empire of Caesar's creation were divinely sanctioned, and necessary to
each other.

36: � larges pans, �on a generous scale�.

37: la clef de vo�te, �the keystone�.

38: ducs � fleurons, �dukes with flowered escutcheons.�

39: nous arrive fanfare, �comes to us like trumpet-blast.�

40: What follows, the vision of the People, is very characteristic of
Hugo, however unlike anything that Charles would have thought, and it
is nobly expressed.

41: l'�treignant. The antecedent of the _l'_ is _pyramide_.

42: sur ses hautes zones. The antecedent of _ses_ is _pyramide_.

43: des empires, the object of _verrait_.

44: son flux. The antecedent of _son_ is _flot_, in line 25.

45: The antecedent of _le_ and _il_ is _flot_ again.

46: Il n'aille pas me prendre, impersonal, �There came not over me a
giddiness.�

47: seulement, �even�.

48: d�t en parlant, �even if in speaking�.

49: dusses-tu me dire, see preface.

50: Qui vive? �Who goes there?�

51: �tranger par sa m�re, �a foreigner on his mother's side�, the
Spanish side. See note 59, act I.

52: meure comme un H�breu, a testimony to the constancy of the Jews
under persecution.

53: roue et tenailles mordantes, �the wheel (of torture) and the
biting (red-hot) pincers.�

54: chevalets, �wooden horses�: trestles with a sharp ridge, upon
which victims were set astride for torture.

55: lampes ardentes, �fires�, applied with careful ingenuity to the
feet, generally.

56: Je te rends ce cor, see note 86, act III.

57: Avec Dieu dans ceci je suis d'intelligence, �God is on my side in
this.�

58: d�s ce soir, simply, �this evening�.

59: le tra�tre, meaning Charles, whom he considers the real traitor.

60: S'il p�rit, means Hernani.

61: sans nous y soustraire, �without ever giving up�, �without
defection�.

62: Jurons sur cette croix. His sword, like a crusader's, had a guard
at right angles to the hilt, thus forming across.

63: Conn�table d'Espagne, by thus naming him the Emperor appoints
Alcala to this high office, and then in the same manner gives Almu�an
the Admiralty of Castile, a position of great honor.

64: Majest�! The sycophant Ricardo is the first to proffer the new
title, which was supposed to belong to emperors alone. Charles,
however, is said to have caused it to be employed towards himself
while yet only King of Spain.

65: Alcade du palais. �Governor of the palace.�

66: Deux �lecteurs. This is not correct. The news of his election was
brought from Frankfort to Charles at Barcelona by the Count Palatine.
The Duke of Bavaria was not at that time an elector.

67: chambre dor�e. The election took place in the splendid hall of a
building in Frankfort known as the R�mer.

68: roi des Romains. One of the concomitant titles of the Emperor was
King of the Romans. When an Emperor was so fortunate as to be crowned
at Rome he assumed the clamys and sandals of a Roman patrician, and
great sanctity was attached to this dignity as perpetuating the line
of the ancient city.

69: fr�re de Boh�me. Kings then as now addressed each other as �my
brother�.

70: vous �tes familier, �I count you as an intimate friend.�

71: J'y suis! �I have succeeded.�

72: son poignard, see act II, scene 2.

73: au mur de Balthazar, �on Belshazzar's wall�. See the Book of
Daniel, v. 5.

74: Les rois Rodrigue font les comtes Julien. Roderick, King of
Andalusia, assumed sway over all Spain in 709. In the opposition was a
certain Count Julian, commander of the Gothic forces in Morocco, who
betrayed his master's forces to the Saracens. These, victorious in
Africa, crossed into Spain and defeated and killed Roderick in 711.
He has been called the last of the Goths, and is the subject of an
ambitious poem by Robert Southey. According to Spanish legend, as
embodied in ancient ballads, the treachery of Count Julian was an act
of revenge for the dishonoring of his sister by King Roderick.

75: Segorbe, a town in Valencia, in eastern Spain.

76: Cordona, a small town in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain.

77: Monroy, Monroyo, a small town in eastern Spain, a few miles west
of Tortosa.

78: Albatera, a village in Valencia, in eastern Spain.

79: Gor. Venta de Gor is a small village a few miles north of
Granada.

80: grand maitre d'Avis. The order of Avis was a Portuguese
decoration.

81: penser, infinitive used as noun.

82: Laisse r�gner l'esprit. Speaking to his heart, he bids it cease
to disturb his mind, which is full of lofty purposes.

83: The Austrian coat of arms contains a double-headed eagle with an
escutcheon on its breast.

84: Saint �tienne, Saint Stephen.

85: mis�res du roi, �pettiness of the king�.

86: Le Danois � punir, perhaps an allusion to the fact that the
Danish parliament was one of the first large political bodies to defy
the Pope and set up a national church (1527).

87: Le Saint-P�re � payer. Pope Leo X adroitly avoided declaring
himself for either Charles or Francis, yet maintained such a position
that the successful competitor should consider himself his debtor.

88: Venise. Robertson says that the �views and interest of the
Venetians were not different from those of the Pope�, and yet that
they sided with Francis, because they had more to fear and to hope
from him.

89: Soliman. Soliman the Magnificent, Emperor of Constantinople, was
knocking loudly at the doors of western Europe, and one of the reasons
why Frederick the Wise declined his election was that Charles would
prove a stronger power against the Turks.




ACT V.


1: cherchant fortune, �a-courting�.

2: Vouliez-vous pas qu'il m�t son cercueil de la noce? �You wouldn't
have him drag his coffin into the wedding?�

3: lui fait ombre, �disturbs him�.

4: Pourpoint de comte, empli de conseils d'alguazil, �Count's
doublet, full of wise saws and modern instances.�

5: Il n'avait garde. �He was careful not to.�

6: Il trouve � qui parler. �I am not afraid of a conversation with
him.�

7: par la rampe de l'escalier, �along the balustrade of the
stairway�.

8: Quelque mauvais plaisant, �some would-be joker�.

9: en attendant l'enfer, �before he comes to fetch us to hell�.

10: C'est un plaisant dr�le, �He's a queer lot!� Here _plaisant_ is
the adjective; in note 1, preface, it was the noun.

11: celle-ci, �this dance�.

12: In prose this would be: _qu'avec vous mon mari les compte_.

13: Il compte, �He keeps time�.

15: amie, �my dear�.

16: Vienne ma do�a Sol, �Let but my do�a Sol come�, etc.

20: Seriez vous dans cette s�r�nade de moiti�! �Have you not had a
hand in this serenade?�

21: Ce devrait �tre fait. �This must be ended.�

22: Fuss�-je votre fille. �Even were I your daughter.�

23: Qu'ils sont heureux! A phrase of great power. Observe also that
Hernani suppresses almost all evidence of his pain in the presence of
Do�a Sol.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
